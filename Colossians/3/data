\s New life because of being one with Christ
\p
\v 1 As I just said earlier, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Col. 2:6-20, and especially verse 12\x* we consider ourselves to be one with the body of Christ when He came back to life from death and went up to heaven. Because of that, let’s think like this, “I just long for heaven, where Christ Jesus sits at the right side of God!”
\v 2 So let our hearts and minds be focused on heaven, not on this world.
\v 3 For in this world, our lives are no longer like they were before we knew Jesus. But we’ve died to that way of life, and our spirits are with Christ Jesus in heaven, where He lives united with God.
\v 4 Our source of life is actually Christ, so when God shows our King to everyone, we’ll also be shown with Him in the brightness of His glory!
\p
\v 5 For that reason, each of us should convince ourselves like this, “Every part of my body has died to the various desires of the world,
\q1 like the desire to commit adultery,
\q1 other sexual sins,
\q1 lust,
\q1 the desire to do other evil things,
\q1 and the desire to have a lot of money.”
\m The desire to have a lot of money is just like worshiping idols, because you’ve become the servant of money.
\v 6 Those evil things make God angry, so He’ll soon destroy everyone in this world who doesn’t want to obey Him.
\v 7 And of course we must not forget that we used to live like them too.
\p
\v 8 But now, let’s all throw away each of the traits of the old life that are in us, like
\q1 anger,
\q1 hating and slandering other people,
\q1 along with speaking unclean things.
\m
\v 9 And we as brothers and sisters in the faith can’t deceive each other, because we’ve thrown away the traits of the old life like a person throws away ruined clothes.
\v 10 Now we’ve been given new clothes, that is new lives that change day by day to become more like Jesus Himself. God the Creator has done this in us, because we already know Him through Jesus.
\v 11 For that reason, we no longer feel that there’s a difference between Jews, the circumcised people group, and non-Jews, uncircumcised people groups. And we no longer discriminate if someone comes from a foreign people group, or an evil people group, or if a person has high status or is humble like a slave. But the important thing for us is that we’ve all become one people because of being one with Christ.
\s New life with other people
\p
\v 12 For that reason Brothers and sisters, these traits should become like new clothing for us who’ve been chosen, loved and purified by God as His own people:
\q1 compassionate for each other in trouble,
\q1 always generous,
\q1 humble,
\q1 gentle
\q1 and patient with others.
\m
\v 13 Let’s not notice the weaknesses of our brothers and sisters in the faith, but we should forgive each other, if someone does wrong. Remember that God has previously forgiven our sins, so in the same way we’re also obligated to forgive each other.
\v 14 But the most important of all these traits is to love each other. Let love be like a bond that unites us completely.
\v 15 And may the feeling of calmness in the protection of Christ control your hearts and minds. For that’s why God called us to become members of one body, which is the body of Christ, so that we live united and calm. And let’s always be thankful to Him.
\p
\v 16 The teaching about Christ should keep leading you and growing healthy in your hearts so that you can teach and advise each other wisely. One way to do that is to sing songs that are based on the Book of Psalms and other praise songs, along with songs that are given by God’s Spirit. May your hearts always be filled with feelings of thankfulness to God.
\v 17 We should say and do everything as if we are representing the Lord Jesus in this world. And let's keep thanking God the Father through Him!
\s New life among the family
\p
\v 18 I urge every wife to follow the will of her husband, because that’s the way of life that suits us who are one with the Lord.
\p
\v 19 Each husband is obligated to love his wife and shouldn’t make her bitter.\f * \fr 3:19 \fk shouldn't make her bitter \ft This phrase in Greek can also mean, “don’t hold a grudge against your wife.”\f*
\p
\v 20 Children, obey your parents in everything too, because that really pleases the Lord.
\p
\v 21 And fathers, don’t make your children bitter. If you do that, they won’t be motivated to live well.
\s New life between masters and slaves
\p
\v 22 Each of you who’ve been sold to rich person and work as his slave must obey him in everything. Don’t obey only when he can see you, like people who just want to please men. But obey him wholeheartedly, because you fear and obey the Lord Jesus.
\v 23 Whatever you do for your master, do it wholeheartedly, because you are actually serving the Lord, not man!
\v 24 Remember that it’s the Lord who will give you your reward, that is when He gives what He has promised to us who’ve been adopted as His children. Don’t forget that you are actually servants of Christ who are working for Him.
\v 25 But the Lord will punish everyone who does dishonest things. And the Lord isn’t partial!
