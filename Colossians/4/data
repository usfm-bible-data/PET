\v 1 Each of you who own slaves should treat them right and honestly. You masters can’t forget that you have a Master in heaven!
\s Paul’s advise to all followers of Christ
\p
\v 2 Keep fighting in prayer. Always be on guard to pay attention to things that need to be prayed for, and always be thankful to God.
\v 3 Remember that I am imprisoned now because I tell the Good News about Christ which God has revealed to us. For that reason, pray that God keeps giving us opportunities to tell that news too.
\v 4 Pray especially that I can tell it as clearly as possible, because that’s the responsibility God has given to me.
\p
\v 5 Think wisely about how to live among people who don’t yet believe in Jesus, and use every opportunity that you are given so that He is glorified.
\v 6 Always speak what friendly and sweet to hear. That way you’ll learn how to wisely answer each of their questions about our King.
\s News about the people who are with Paul
\p
\v 7 Tychicus, who is bringing this letter to you, is our beloved brother, who like us is one with the Lord Jesus. He and I are both servants of Christ, and he’s faithfully helping me in the ministry. He’ll tell you about everything that’s happening to me.
\v 8 That’s why I've sent him to you. I hope that he will tell you about our situation here, and that he will encourage your hearts.
\v 9 I’m also sending our beloved brother Onesimus with him. Onesimus comes from your congregation, and is very faithful to Jesus. Our two brothers will tell you about everything that’s happening here.
\p
\v 10 Aristarchus, who is being held with me in this prison, sends greetings to you. And Mark, who is a cousin of Barnabas, also sends greetings. I’ve already sent you news about Mark. If he comes, I hope you’ll receive him well.
\v 11 Justus, who was formerly called Jesus, also sends you greetings. Like me, those three brothers of the faith come from the Jewish people.\f + \fr 4:11 \fk from the Jewish people \ft Literally, “from the circumcised people.”\f* Those three are the only ones who work with me now so that more and more people become citizens of God’s kingdom. I’ve been really comforted because of them!
\p
\v 12 Epaphras, who is from your church, also sends greetings to you. He’s also working as a servant of Christ Jesus. He always struggles for you in prayer so that you’ll endure and become mature in following Jesus, and so that you’ll be very certain about everything God desires for you.
\v 13 I testify to you that he really struggles very hard for you, including the brothers and sisters in the faith who are in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.
\v 14 Luke, who is the doctor we love, and Demas, also send greetings to you.
\p
\v 15 Give our greetings to the brothers and sisters in the faith in Laodicea. We also send greetings to Nympha and to the church that normally meets in her house.
\v 16 After this letter has been read in your church, please send it on to Laodicea so that they read it too. And I hope you also read the letter that I’ve written to the church in Laodicea. \f + \fr 4:16 \fk letter … the church in Laodicea \ft According to the opinion of many interpreters, it's quite posible that Paul's letter to Philemon is the letter that's meant here.\f*
\v 17 I’m asking you to tell Archippus, “Pay attention so that you finish the task that was given to you because you are one with the Lord Jesus.”
\p
\v 18 I Paul, am the one writing these words of greeting with my own hand. Greetings from me! Don’t forget to pray for me, bound with an iron chain in this prison! I pray that God will always be kind to each of you.
