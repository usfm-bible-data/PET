\s Nehemiah's Prayer
\p
\v 1 I am [>> a note] Nehemiah son of Hakaliah. I write this history to report the actions I have made.
\p In the month of Kislew\f + \fr 1: 1 \fk Kislew \ft Name of the ninth month in the Jewish calendar. The period of this month runs from mid-November to mid-December. \f* in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes reign, while I was at Susan Fort,
\v 2 my brother named Hanani came to see me with some people from Judah. I asked them about the condition of the Jews left in the territory of Judah, the news of the people who had returned from exile in Babylon, and the situation of the city of Jerusalem.
\v 3 They answered, "The people who have returned from exile and the people left behind in the province\f + \fr 1: 3 \fk province \ft see note at 2Ki. 25:22 \f* of Judah are experiencing many hardships and are humiliated. The walls of Jerusalem have been torn down, and the gates have been burned."
\p
\v 4 Hearing the news, I sat down and cried. For days I continued to mourn, fast, and pray to the Heavenly God.
\v 5 I said, â€œO Lord, God who reigns in heaven, You are a great and extraordinary God. You keep Your covenants and cherish those who love and keep Your commandments.
\v 6 Look at me and hear my prayer. I pray day and night for Israel, Your people. I admit that the people of Israel have sinned against You. Also I and my ancestors have sinned.
\v 7 We have sinned by disobeying the commandments, laws, and statutes that You gave through Moses, Your servant.
\v 8 O Lord, remember Your words through Moses, 'If you sin, I will scatter you among the nations. \x + \xo 1: 8 \xt Lev. 26: 33 \x*
\v 9 But if you return to Me and obey My commands, then even if you are banished to the ends of the earth, I will gather you back to the place I have appointed, which is the place where I am worshiped. '\x + \xo 1 : 9 \xt Deut. 30: 1-5 \x*
\v 10 We are Your servants and Your people whom You have saved with Your might and great power.
\v 11 O Lord, please listen to the prayers of Your servants, as well as the prayers of Your other servants, who always honor You. Give Your servant courage when I come to ask the king for help. Soften her heart so that she can be nice to me. "
\p At that time my position was cupbearer of the king.
