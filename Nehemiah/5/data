\s To write off the debts of fellow Jews
\p
\v 1 Some time later another problem arose. Many Jews, both men and women, cried out for justice for the oppression perpetrated by the Jewish nobility.
\v 2 They said, “Our family is big and we have many children. We need food to survive. "
\v 3 There were also those who complained, “During drought disaster and the famine, we had to borrow money from wealthy Jews to get food  [> and we mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and houses //crops, vineyards, and houses. Now we have almost nothing left.] "
\v 4 And there were those who said, “We have to borrow money to pay taxes on our land and vineyards to the king.
\v 5 In fact, we are both Jews, as are the officials. Neither are our children inferior to their children. But we were forced to sell our children into slavery as a way out to pay off our debt. We are helpless, we cannot do anything else, because all our possessions, namely fields and vineyards, already belongs  to the rich people. "
\p
\v 6 Hearing their complaints, I became very angry.
\v 7 After thinking about it carefully, I strongly rebuked the nobles and officials, saying, "How can you oppress  your fellow countrymen ?!" Then I called to a general meeting to discuss the matter.
\v 8 At the meeting I said to them, “We are trying our best to redeem our brothers, fellow Jews, who have become slaves to foreigners. But you sold them back as slaves instead. How often do we have to redeem them ?! ” The nobles and officials had nothing to say in self-defense.
\v 9 I continued, “What you did was wrong! We must show honor to our God by living the right way of life, [> so that our enemies from other nations cannot blame us. //so that people of other nations cannot find our fault.] \ X + \ xo 5: 3-9 \ xt Deut. 23: 19-20 \ x *
\v 10 I myself, my brothers and my employees have lent money and grain to the people, [> but now let us let us stop lending money to get profit of their debts like this//but now let's just write off their debts].
\v 11 [>Now/today/ right now] Give back the fields, vineyards, olive groves, and their homes that you have taken. Also return the loan interest that you have received. "
\v 12 They replied, "We will do as you say and return their property, without asking for any payment." Then I made them swear before the priests to return the treasure.
\v 13 [And shaking out the folds of my robe//Then I emptied my pockets and said,] "If you don't keep your oath, this is what Allah will do to you. He will empty all your treasures, even take your houses. " Everyone present answered, "Amen!" then praise the LORD. They each keep their oath.
\s1 Nehemiah's policy of leadership
\p
\v 14 From the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign to the present day, I have been governor of Judah. And during these twelve years, my family and I did not want to accept the food allowance that the governor is entitled to.
\v 15 I did this because all the governors who served before me had made things difficult for the people by requiring them to pay forty pieces of silver every day for food and drink allowances. Even their employees oppress the people. But I respect God and I don't want to do that.
\v 16 I and all of my employees devoted all our attention, time, and money to rebuilding the fortress of Jerusalem, so that we didn't buy land for ourselves at all.
\v 17 In addition I provided food for 150 Jews, their leaders, and a number of visitors from other nations.
\v 18 To provide that food, every day you need one cow, six best lambs, and lots of chickens. The wine supply must also be replenished every ten days. Even so, I still don't want to take the governor's allowance, because I know that the people are already burdened with heavy taxes.
\v 19 I prayed, [> O my God, may you remember all the good I have done for this people //"O my God, count upon me the reward for all that I have done for this nation."]
