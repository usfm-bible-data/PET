\s1 Nehemiah goes to Jerusalam
\p
\v 1 A few months later, namely the month Nisan\x + \xo 2:1 \xt See the Note on Ul. 16:1 \ x *, I was tasked with serving wine to the King Artaxerxes. It turned out that at that time my face looked sad, even though I had never looked sad before at  the kings presence.
\v 2 Therefore the king asked me, "Why is your face so gloomy? You look healthy but seem like you're thinking about a big problem. “I became very scared,
\v 3 But I replied, "Long life to our King! How I would not be sad, my lord, my hometown, which is Jerusalem, is now in ruins and the gates have been destroyed in flames."
\v 4 The King asked me, "Then what is your request regarding this matter?" I prayed silently to God,
\v 5 then I answered the King, “If my lord would like to grant your servant's request, please send me to the province of Judah to rebuild the city of Jerusalem.”
\v 6 Asked the King, "If I let you go, [>>how long will you go and] when will you come back?" At that time, the queen was sitting close to the king.
\p I proposed a definite date to the king, and he also agreed to let me go.
\v 7 In addition, I also asked him, "If my Lord is pleased, please write a royal order for me to convey to the competent authorities. First to the provincial governors of the west of the Euphrates river, that they may let me pass through their territory on the way to Judah.
\v 8 The second one, to Asaph, the manager of the King's forest, so he may gave me wood beams, because I will need it to make the gates of the House of the Lord, the city fortress, and for my  own house. "The King granted out all my request, because of God's help.
\p
\v 9 The King also sent a number of army officers and cavalry to escort me on the way. Then I left and found the governors in the west side of the river Euphrates. I gave to them the letters from the king.
\v 10 when Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the Ammonite, heard the news of my arrival, they were very angry because I want to help the Israelites.
\S1 Nehemiah inspects Jerusalem’s wall
\p
\v 11-12 three days after arriving in Jerusalem, I and some people went out secretly at night. I rode the donkey, while the others went on foot. I did not tell anyone about the plan that God put in my heart to rebuild  Jerusalem.
\v 13 I went out through the Valley Gate, past throught the Dragon’s Well, and came to the Garbage Disposal Gate to inspect the damaged section of the fort and the gate that had been burned.
\v 14 Then I went to Fountain Gate  and  to the King’sPool, but my donkey couldn’t couldn't get through the rubble there.
\v 15 So, I went to the Kidron Valley and checked the fortress there, then returned through the valley Gate.
\v 16 The city officials didn’t know that I had inspected the places out there, because I did not say anything about my plan to the Jewish leaders, whether the priests, officials or anyone in the government.
\p
\v 17 But then I said to them, "You know very well the problems of our city. The fortress has collapsed and the gates have been burned. Let us rebuild the fortress of the Jerusalem, so that we won’t be insulted again!”
\v 18 Then I told them about God's help that had been generous to me so that the king wanted to support this plan. They replied at once, "Great! Let's rebuild our city fortress! ” So they started the good work.
\v 19 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem, the Arab heard of our plans, they laughed and insulted us by saying, “[@ You are stupid! // What kind of stupid deeds ?!] Are you going to rebel against the king? “
\v 20 I replied, "Listen carefully, the Heavenly God definitely will help us. We His servants will start rebuilding the fortress of this city. But You don’t need to get ivolved on it, because you don’t have any busysness or right in Jerusalem! "
