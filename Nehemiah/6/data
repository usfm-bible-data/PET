\s The enemy continued to terrify Nehemiah
\p
\v 1 [> and when] Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and our other enemies heard that I had rebuilt the fortress of Jerusalem and that there weren’t any damaged parts. At that time the gates were not set up yet.
\v 2 Then Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me that said, “Let us arrange a time to meet at the village of Kefirim \ f + \ fr 6: 2 \ fk Kefirim \ ft. It is not certain whether the word 'tofend' in the Hebrew text is place name. The Septuagint translates it as "one of the villages." \ F *, on the Ono plain, north of the city of Jerusalem. " But I knew that they have arranged an evil plan to harm me.
\v 3 So I sent back the messengers with this answer, “I am doing a great job and [Ican’t come down// I cannot leave it]. There's no way I can stop this job just to see you. "
\v 4 They sent the same message four times, and I always gave the same answer.
\v 5 The fifth time Sanballat sent me a message through his servant, it was in the form of an open letter. \ f + \ fk 5: 6 \ fr open letter \ ft Leaving a letter open deliberately so that the contents of the letter can be read or known to all . \ f *
\v 6 These are the contents of the letter, [> “It is reported among the nations, and Goshem sayas it, that you and the Jews intent to rebel. Because of that, you are building the wall, and they say that your purpose is to rebel against the Persian empire.//“Geshem has gone to various countries. There he heard rumors that you and the Jews were rebuilding the fortress of Jerusalem because they wanted to rebel against the Persian empire.]
\v 7 According to the reports we receive, you will also be their king. You even appointed some prophets to announce in Jerusalem, 'Judah has a king, he is Nehemiah!' King Artaxerxes must have received this report. So, I suggest that we meet to discuss this issue and find a way out so that you won’t be punished."
\v 8 Then I sent a reply, “All of your words are not true. All of it is just your own invention. "
\v 9 Our enemies tried to frighten us, thinking that we would be so discouraged that we could not finish building the city fortress. But I relied on God and prayed, "O God, give me strength!"
\p
\v 10 One day, not long after the incident, I needed to talk to Shemaiah, son of Delaiah, grandson of Mehetabel. Because Shemaiah couldn't leave the house, I came to his house. He said, "Let us hide in the house of the LORD and lock all the doors, because tonight your enemies will come to kill you."
\v 11 But I replied, “As a leader, I don't deserve to run away when there is danger. That's cowardice. After all, I am not a priest, and I should not enter into the house of God carelessly, much less just to save myself. Not! I won't do that! "
\v 12 I know that God did not send Shemaiah to prophesy this. He said it was because Tobia and Sanballat paid it.
\v 13 They thought the threat could scare me, and doing so, I would sinned by following their advice. So that they can blame me and defame me.
\v 14 I prayed, "O my God, remember all the evil things that Tobiah and Sanballat had done, also the prophet Noadiah, and the other prophets who tried to frighten me."
\s The Construction of the city fortress of Jerusalem is complete
\p
\v 15 After fifty-two days of work, the construction of the city fortress of Jerusalem was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul \ f + \ fk 6:15 \ fr Elul \ ft The month of Elul is the sixth month in the Jewish calendar. In the current calendar it is estimated that from late August to early September. \ F *
\v 16 When all our enemies heard this news, and the Gentiles around the province of Judah saw that we had finished the fortress of the city, they were afraid and ashamed. They realized that the work we were doing was successful because of the help of our God.
\p
\v 17 During that time, the aristocrats of Judah frequently wrote letters to Tobiah,
\v 18 because many of the people of Judah have pledged allegiance to Tobiah, because he is the son-in-law of Shecaniah, the son of Arah. And Tobiah's son, Johohanan, is married to Meshullam's daughter, Berechiah's grandson.
\v 19 The nobles often praised Tobiah's good deeds in front of me. They also reported what I said to Tobia. Because of this, Tobiah sent letters to scare me.
