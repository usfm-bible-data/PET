\s The LORD gives power to Moses
\p
\v 1 Moses answered, “What if they don't believe and don't listen to me? What if they say, 'The LORD did not see you!'”
\p
\v 2 The LORD said to Moses, “What is that in your hand?”
\m Moses answered, “A staff.“
\p
\v 3 Then the LORD said, “Throw the staff onto the ground.” So Moses threw his staff to the ground, and the staff became a snake. Moses just ran away.
\p
\v 4 But the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand and hold the tail.” Then Moses stretched out his hand and caught the snake's tail, and the snake turned back into a staff.
\p
\v 5 The LORD said, “Do this so that the people of Israel believe that the LORD, the God of their ancestors, namely the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has seen you.”
\p
\v 6 The LORD said again to Moses, “Put your hand inside your robe.” So Moses put his hand inside his robe, and when he took out his hand, his hand was visibly stricken by a skin disease, so that his skin peeled and was scaly white like snow.
\v 7 Then the LORD said again, “Put your hand back inside your robe.” So Moses put his hand back in his robe. And when he pulled out his hand, his hand had visibly returned as it was before.
\p
\v 8 The LORD said “If they do not believe you or do not heed the first sign that I gave, they will believe in the second sign.
\v 9 If they do not believe those two signs and do not obey your words, take water from the Nile and pour the water on the ground. The water will become blood.”
\p
\v 10 But Moses said to the LORD, “O my Master, I am not good at speaking — both before and since the LORD spoke to me. Because the way I speak is slow and not fluent.”
\p
\v 11 Then the LORD said, “Who created the human mouth? Who determines someone to become mute or deaf? Who makes people blind or see? Isn’t it I, the LORD, who do that?
\v 12 Go now! I will be with you when you speak, and I will tell you what you have to say.”
\p
\v 13 But Moses replied, “My Master, I beg you to send someone else.”
\p
\v 14 The LORD became angry with Moses and said, “What about your older sibling Aaron? He is a Levite who speaks well. Now he is on his way to meet you. He will be very happy to meet with you.
\v 15 You will talk to him, and deliver what he must say. I will help both of you to talk, and will tell you what you have to do.
\v 16 Aaron will become your spokesman to the people of Israel and you will be like God to him by telling him what he must say.
\v 17 Bring this staff. You will use it to do various miraculous signs. ”
\s Moses returns to Egypt
\p
\v 18-19 Then Moses returned to Midian, and the LORD said to him, “Return to Egypt, because all who want to kill you are dead.” So Moses requested leave of his father-in-law, Jethro, "Permit me to return to Egypt to find out if my brothers are still alive.”
\p Jethro answered, “Go. May you be safe on your journey.”
\p
\v 20 So Moses put his wife and children on a donkey to return to Egypt. Moses brought the staff in his hand according to God's command.\f + \fr 17:9 \fk staff … \ft Literally, 'God's staff'.\f*
\p
\v 21 The LORD said to Moses, “I have made you able to do miracles. When you return to Egypt, perform the miraculous signs before the king of Egypt. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let My people go.
\v 22 Then you must say to the king, 'This is what the Lord says: The people of Israel are my firstborn son.
\v 23 I say to you, "Let My child go, so that he may worship Me." If you reject this, then I will kill your firstborn child.’”
\p
\v 24 On his way to Egypt, one night they encamped, the LORD met Moses and intended to kill him.\f + \fr 4:24 \fk the LORD … intends to kill him \ft The story in verses 24-26 always raises the question, “Why does the LORD want to kill someone who He has just sent?” We are not given certain information about this, but this can be put forward as one of the answers: Moses now returns to Egypt because he was sent to lead Israel, who was the firstborn of the LORD. Even though Moses himself had not obeyed the command given to Abraham that was inherited by the people of Israel — that is that every boy had to be circumcised to show that he was included in God's covenant to Abraham and his descendants. (Gen. 17: 10-14) When Zipporah touched Moses' feet with their child's circumcised skin that was cut off, it was a sign that the circumcision she performed was considered in the name of Moses. \f*
\v 25-26 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone like a knife, then she circumcised their child. Then with the skin she had cut, she touched Moses' feet while saying, “My husband, you are marked with blood!”\f + \fr 4:25 \fk Zipporah's quote \ft Literally Zipporah's words can be translated, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me.” Albata's translation team realizes that the intent of Zipporah's words are not clear in the TSI. That is caused because its meaning in the source language cannot be determined with certainty. One explanation (of the meaning) is shown in the footnote for verse 24.\f* Zipporah's mentioning blood refers to the previously recounted circumcision. And after that, the LORD let Moses live.
\s1 Aaron is sent to meet Moses
\p
\v 27 The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met Moses on the mountain of God, then he kissed his brother.
\v 28 Moses told Aaron about all the words of the LORD which must be delivered to the king of Egypt, and about the miraculous signs that the LORD commanded Moses to do.
\p
\v 29 Then Moses and Aaron went to gather all the elders of the people of Israel.
\v 30 Aaron delivered to them all that the Lord had told Moses and did miraculous signs before them.
\v 31 They believed, and when they heard that the LORD was paying attention to the Israelites and had seen their oppression, they prostrated themselves to worship the LORD.
