\s the Lord gave power to Moses
\p
\v 1 Moses answered, "What if they don't believe and don't listen to me? What if they say, "The Lord does not reveal himself to you?"
\p
\v 2 The Lord said to Moses, "Is that in your hand?"
\m Moses answered, "A stick."
\p
\v 3 Then He said, "Throw the staff into the ground." So Moses threw his staff to the ground, and the stick turned into a snake. Moses ran away.
\p
\v 4 But the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand and hold the tail." Then Moses stretched out his hand and caught the snake's tail, and the snake turned back into a stick.
\p
\v 5 The Lord said, "Do this so that the people of Israel believe that the Lord, the God of their ancestors, namely the God of Abraham, God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has revealed himself to you."
\p
\v 6 The LORD said to Moses, "Put your hand in your robe." So Moses put his hand in his robe, and when he took out his hand, his hand was exposed to a skin disease, so that his skin peeled and scaly white like snow.
\v 7 Then the Lord said again, "Put your hand back in your robe." So Moses put his hand back in his robe. And when he pulled out his hand, his hands were recovered as before.
\p
\v 8 The LORD says "If they do not believe in you or do not heed the first sign that I give, they will believe in the next sign.
\v 9 If they do not believe the two signs and do not obey your words, take water from the Nile and spill the water on the ground. The water will turn into blood.
\p
\v 10 But Moses said to the Lord, "O my masters, I am not good at speaking — both past and present. Because the way my speech is slow and not smooth. "
\p
\v 11 Then the Lord said, "Who created the human mouth? Who sets someone to be mute or deaf? Who makes people see or blind? Am I not, Lord?
\v 12 Go now! I will enable you to speak, and I will teach you what you have to say. "
\p
\v 13 But Moses replied, "My Master, I beg you to send someone else."
\p
\v 14 The Lord became angry with Moses and said, "What about your brother Aaron? He is a Levi who speaks well. Now he is on his way to see you. He will be very happy to meet you.
\v 15 You will talk to him, and say what he has to say. I will help both of you to talk, and will teach you what you have to do.
\v 16 Aaron will be your spokesman to the people of Israel and you will be like God to him by telling him what to say.
\v 17 Bring this stick, you will use it to do miraculous signs. "
\s Moses returned to Egypt
\p
\v 18-19 Then Moses returned to Midian, and the Lord said to him, "Return to Egypt, because all who want to kill you are dead." So Moses returned to his father-in-law, Jethro, and begged himself, "Let me go back to Egypt to search know if my brothers are still alive. "
\p Jethro answered, "Go, and hope you are safe on your journey."
\p
\v 20 So Moses brought his wife and children on a donkey, and they returned to Egypt. Moses brought the stick in his hand according to God's command.
\p
\v 21 The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, do it before the king of Egypt the miraculous signs that I have authorized you. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let my people go.
\v 22 Then you must say to the king, "This is what the Lord says," The people of Israel are my firstborn son.
\v 23 I say to you, ‘Let my child go, so that he may worship Me. 'If you reject this, then I will kill your firstborn child." ’"
\p
\v 24 On his way to Egypt, the LORD met Moses and intended to kill him. \f + \fr 4:24 \fk God ... intends to kill him \ft The story in verses 24-26 always raises the question, "Why does the Lord want to kill someone who has just He sent? "We are not given certain information about this, but this can be put forward as one of the answers: Moses now returned to Egypt because he was sent to lead Israel, who was the firstborn of the Lord. Even though Moses himself had not obeyed the command given to Abraham inherited by the people of Israel - that is, every boy had to be circumcised to show that he was included in God's covenant to Abraham and his descendants. (Gen. 17: 10-14) When Sipora touched Moses' feet with their child's circumcised skin cut off, it was a sign that the circumcision he performed was considered in the name of Moses. \f*
\v 25-26 Then Sipora took a sharp stone like a knife, then she circumcised their child. Then with the skin he had cut, he touched Moses' feet. While saying, "My husband, you are marked with blood!" The meaning of Sipora by mentioning blood is the matter of the circumcision. And after that, the LORD let Moses live.
\s1 Aaron was sent to meet Moses
\p
\v 27 The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses." So he went and met Moses on the mountain of Allah, then he kissed his sister.
\v 28 Moses told Aaron about all the words of the LORD which must be delivered to the king of Egypt, and about the miraculous signs that the LORD commanded.
\p
\v 29 Then Moses and Aaron went to gather all the elders of the people of Israel. v 30 Aaron delivered to them all that the Lord had told Moses and did miraculous signs before them.
\v 31 They believe, and when they heard that the LORD was watching the Israelites and had seen their oppression, they prostrated themselves to worship the LORD.
