\s The LORD gives power to Moses
\p
\v 1 Moses answered, “What if they don't believe and don't listen to me? What if they say, 'The LORD did not reveal Himself to you'?”
\p
\v 2 The LORD said to Moses, “What is that in your hand?”
\m Moses answered, “A staff.“
\p
\v 3 Then He said, “Throw the staff onto the ground.” So Moses threw his staff onto the ground, and the staff turned into a snake. Moses ran away.
\p
\v 4 But the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand and hold the tail.” Then Moses stretched out his hand and caught the snake's tail, and the snake turned back into a stick.
\p
\v 5 The LORD said, “Do this so that the people of Israel believe that the LORD, the God of their ancestors, namely the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has revealed Himself to you.”
\p
\v 6 The LORD said again to Moses, “Put your hand inside your robe.” So Moses put his hand inside his robe, and when he took out his hand, it was seen his hand was stricken by a skin disease, so that his skin peeled and was scaly white like snow.
\v 7 Then the LORD said again, “Put your hand back inside your robe.” So Moses put his hand back in his robe. And when he pulled out his hand, it was seen his hand had recovered back as it was before.
\p
\v 8 The LORD said “If they do not believe you or do not heed the first sign that I gave, they will believe in the following sign.
\v 9 If they do not believe those two signs and do not obey your words, take water from the Nile river and pour the water on the ground. The water will turn into blood.”
\p
\v 10 But Moses said to the LORD, “O my Ruler, I am not good at speaking — both before and now. Because the way I speak is slow and not fluent.”
\p
\v 11 Then the LORD said, “Who created the human mouth? Who determines someone to be mute or deaf? Who makes people to see or be blind? Isn’t it I, the LORD?
\v 12 Go now! I will enable you to speak, and I will teach you what you have to say.”
\p
\v 13 But Moses replied, “My Ruler, I beg you to send someone else.”
\p
\v 14 The LORD became angry with Moses and said, “What about your older sibling Aaron? He is a Levite who speaks well. He is on his way to meet you now. He will be very happy to meet with you.
\v 15 You will talk to him, and deliver what he must say. I will help both of you to talk, and will teach you what you have to do.
\v 16 Aaron will be your spokesman to the people of Israel and you will be like God to him by telling him what he has to say.
\v 17 Bring this staff, you will use it to do miraculous signs. ”
\s Moses returns to Egypt
\p
\v 18-19 Then Moses returned to Midian, and the LORD said to him, “Return to Egypt, because all who want to kill you are dead.” So Moses returned to his father-in-law, Jethro, and excused himself, “Permit me to go back to Egypt to find out if my brothers are still alive.”
\p Jethro answered, “Go, and I hope you are safe on your journey.”
\p
\v 20 So Moses brought his wife and children riding on a donkey, and they returned to Egypt. Moses brought the staff in his hand according to God's command.
\p
\v 21 The LORD said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, do the miraculous signs that I empowered to you in front of the king of Egypt. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let My people go.
\v 22 Then you must say to the king, 'This is what the Lord says, The people of Israel are my firstborn child.
\v 23 I say to you, Let My child go, so that he may worship Me. If you reject this thing, then I will kill your firstborn child.’”
\p
\v 24 On his journey to Egypt, the LORD met Moses and intended to kill him. \f + \fr 4:24 \fk the LORD ... intends to kill him \ft The story in verses 24-26 always raises the question, “Why does the LORD want to kill someone who He has just sent?” We are not given precise information about this, but this can be put forward as one of the answers: Moses now returns to Egypt because he was sent to lead Israel, who was the firstborn child of the LORD. However Moses himself had not obeyed the command given to Abraham that was inherited by the people of Israel — that is that every boy child had to be circumcised to show that he was included in God's promise to Abraham and his descendants. (Gen. 17: 10-14) When Zipporah touched Moses' feet with their child's circumcised skin that was cut off, it was a sign that the circumcision she performed was considered in the name of Moses. \f*
\v 25-26 Then Zipporah took a stone that was sharp like a knife, then she circumcised their child. Then with the skin she had cut, she touched Moses' feet while saying, “My husband, you are marked with blood!” The reason for Zipporah mentioning blood was (because it was) the subject of the circumcision. And after that, the LORD let Moses live.
\s1 Aaron is sent to meet Moses
\p
\v 27 The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met Moses on the mountain of God, then he kissed his younger sibling.
\v 28 Moses told Aaron about all of the words of the LORD which must be delivered to the king of Egypt, and about the miraculous signs that the LORD commanded.
\p
\v 29 Then Moses and Aaron went to gather all the elders of the people of Israel.
\v 30 Aaron delivered to them all that the LORD had told Moses and performed the miraculous signs before them.
\v 31 They believed, and when they heard that the LORD was paying attention to the people of Israel and had seen their oppression, they knelt to worship the LORD.
