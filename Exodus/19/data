\c 19
\s1 The LORD revealed himself on mount of Sinai
\p
\v 1-2 After that the nation of Israel went off from Rephidim and exactly two months\f + \fr 19:1 \fk two months \ft Literally, “on the third month after the people of Israel went out from Egypt, on that same day.” See Num 33:3.\f* after they left Egypt they arrived in the wilderness of Sinai. Then they camped on the foot of the mount of Sinai.
\p
\v 3 Then Moses went up to that mountain to meet God. the LORD called him from that mountain and said, “Let the descendant of Jacob, the people of Israel, know,
\v 4 You yourselves already saw what I did to the people of Egypt and how I brought you out from Egypt, like an eagle that brings her young on her wings.
\v 5 Now, if you obey My commands and hold to My promise, you will be Mine alone. The whole earth is Mine, but you will be My most precious possession among all nations.
\v 6 You will be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation to Me.’ That is what you have to convey to the nation of Israel.”
\p
\v 7 After Moses returned from the mountain, he called the elders of the nation of Israel and conveyed to them all that the LORD commands to be conveyed to them.
\v 8 Then they answered together, “We will do all that the LORD commands to us.” And Moses conveyed their answer to the LORD.
\p
\v 9 The LORD said to Moses, “Actually I am going to come to you in the form of a thick cloud so that the people of Israel may hear when I speak with you, and so they always believe you.”
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, “Go to the people of Israel and prepare them for My coming. Tell them so that they wash themselves and wash the clothes they will wear.
\v 11 Prepare on the third day, because on that day I will go down to mount Sinai witnessed by all the people of Israel.
\v 12 Put up boundaries around that mountain and tell them to not cross that boundary. Tell them, ‘Be careful, don’t go up the mountain or touch that boundary. Everyone who cross it will die.
\v 13 No one may cross that boundary, whether humans or animals. However cross it will have stones thrown at them or shot until dead. The people of Israel may not draw near that mountain until they hear a long trumpet sound.’”
\p
\v 14 Then Moses went down from that mountain and told them to sanctify themselves and wash their clothes.
\v 15 Moses said to them, “Prepare yourselves for the coming of the LORD on the third day and let no one have sex with women until that day arrives.”
\p
\v 16 In the morning of the third day, there are great thunder and lightning and also thick cloud on top of the mountain and also a loud trumpet sound. The whole of Israel nation trembled.
\v 17 Moses brought them out of the camp to meet with God and they stood on the feet of that mountain.
\v 18 All of mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the LORD came down on it in the form of fire. Smoke went up high to the sky like smoke from chimney for brick burning, and the whole mountain shook as if there is a great earthquake.
\v 19 While the sound of trumpet became louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in thunder.
\v 20 Then the LORD went down to the peak of mount Sinai and called Moses to go up there. Then Moses went up.
\p
\v 21 The LORD said to Moses, “Come down and warn the people of Israel so that they don’t cross the boundary that is determined to come to see the LORD. If they violate it, then many of them will die.
\v 22 The priests that will come to Me must also sanctify themselves. If not, I will punish them.”
\p
\v 23 Moses said to the LORD, “The people of Israel will not go up to that mountain because you yourself already warned us, ‘Put up boundaries around that mountain, and sanctify that mountain.’”
\p
\v 24 Then the LORD said, “Come down and bring Aaron up again with you. But don’t let the priests and the people of Israel cross that boundary to come to Me. If they violate it, I will punish them.”
\p
\v 25 Then Moses went down and conveyed to them what the LORD said to him.
