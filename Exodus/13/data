\s1 Statutes regarding firstborn children
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 “Set all the firstborn children in Israel apart as special to me. All who are born first, both humans and animals, are My possessions.”
\p
\v 3 Then Moses said to the people of Israel, “Remember that today is the day you came out of Egypt, from the place of slavery. The LORD has brought you all out of Egypt with His great power. Remember this day by not eating leavened bread.
\v 4 Today in the month of Abib, you all came out of Egypt.
\v 5 You must commemorate this celebration in this month each year after the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, a land that abounds with natural produce, according to His promise to your ancestors.
\v 6 You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the seventh day, hold a celebration to honor the LORD.
\v 7 For seven days, there should be no leavened bread or anything containing yeast in your entire territory.
\p
\v 8 "On that day, say to your sons, “I do all of these statutes regarding the Celebration of Unleavened Bread in order to commemorate what the LORD did for us when we came out of Egypt.”
\v 9 Just as a note can be tied to your hand or forehead as a reminder, so this celebration will become a reminder for us, so that we always remind each other about the commands of the LORD. This celebration will remind us of the way the LORD brought us out of Egypt with His extraordinary power.
\v 10 Because of that, celebrate this statute every year at the appointed time.
\p
\v 11 "The LORD will bring you all into the land of the Canaanites and give that land to you, according to His promise to your fore fathers. When you live in that land,
\v 12 you must surrender every firstborn male child and young male livestock to become the LORD's possession. Each young male livestock mentioned will be sacrificed to the LORD.\f + \fr 13:12 \fk male livestock \ft What is meant by the word 'livestock' is sheep, goats, and cattle. Only four legged livestock that were clean could be offered to the LORD, because frequently there was a portion of the offering that was eaten by the person who brought that sacrifice. Animals like donkeys in verse 13 weren't clean to be eaten and couldn't be offered to the LORD. See the statutes of clean and unclean animals in Lev.11 and Num. 14:1-20.\f*
\v 13 But you must buy back every first born son. And also there is an exception for young male donkeys. That donkey can be bought back by offering a lamb to the LORD. If you don't buy it back, you have to kill that donkey by breaking its neck.
\p
\v 14 "And at some later time, when your children ask, ‘Why do we do these offerings?’ You must answer, ‘Because the LORD brought us out of slavery in Egypt with his great power.
\v 15 When the Egyptian king stubbornly refused to let us go out of Egypt, the LORD killed every firstborn male child in Egypt, both humans and animals. Because of that, we must offer to the LORD every firstborn male of the young of livestock and redeem each of our firstborn male children.’
\v 16 "This celebration is a reminder for us at all times, like a note can be tied to the hand and forehead as a reminder, that the LORD has brought us out of Egypt with His great power.”
\s1 The LORD leads His people
\p
\v 17 When the Egyptian king let the people of Israel go, God did not guide them by way of the main road that crossed the land of the Philistines, even though the distance was closer. God said, “If they were to go by that road and were attacked by enemies, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”
\v 18 So God made them go on a road that was farther, by crossing the wilderness and headed to the Red Sea. The Israelites came out of Egypt prepared to fight.
\p
\v 19 Moses brought Joseph's bones with them, because Joseph had made the Israelites promise, “God will surely come and help you, and at that time you must take my bones out of Egypt.”
\p
\v 20 After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 The LORD preceded them to guide their journey. By day the LORD guided them in the form of a pillar of cloud, and at night in the form of a pillar of fire to illuminate them. In that way they could continue to travel during the day and night following that pillar of cloud and that pillar of fire.\f + \fr 13:21 \fk guide them … \ft Differing from the teaching that has spread in Indonesia and in fact has become the theme of a song, the Bible doesn't teach that the pillar of cloud protected the people of Israel from the heat of the sun, and the pillar of fire function to make the air warmer at night. The function of the two pillars mentioned that is taught in the Bible is to guide the people of Israel in their journey to the land of Canann.\f*
\v 22 In that way the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire at night were always with the people of Israel.
