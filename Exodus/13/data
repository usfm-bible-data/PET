\c 13
\s1 Statutes regarding firstborn
\p
\v 1 The LORD said unto Moses,
\v 2 “Set aside for me all the firstborn in Israel. All who are born first— both humans and animals— are mine.”
\p
\v 3 Then Moses said to the people of Israel, “Remember that today is the day you come out of Egypt, from the place of slavery. The Lord has brought you out of Egypt with His great power. Remember/Observe this day by not eating unleavened bread.
\v 4 Today, in the month of Abib, you will come out of Egypt.
\v 5 You must commemorate this celebration every month after the LORD takes you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, rich and fertile land, according to His promise to your ancestors.
\v 6 You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the seventh day, hold a celebration to honor the Lord.
\v 7 For seven days, there should be no leavened bread or anything leavened in your entire territory.
\p
\v 8 That day, say to your sons, “I do all these things to commemorate what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.”
\v 9 Just as a writing can be tied to your hand or forehead as a reminder to you, so this celebration will be a reminder for you to always remind one another about the laws of the LORD. This celebration will remind you of the way God brought us out of Egypt with His extraordinary power.
\v 10 Therefore, celebrate this decree annually at the appointed time.
\p
\v 11 After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives the land to you, according to His promise to your fathers,
\v 12 you must give over every firstborn male and male calf so that it becomes the LORD's possession.
\v 13 But you can take back each of the male donkeys by offering me a lamb to Me as a ransom. If you don't redeem it, you have to kill the donkey by breaking its neck. But you must redeem every eldest son.
\p
\v 14 And at a later time, when your children ask, ‘What is the meaning of this custom?’ You must answer, ‘The LORD brought us out of slavery in Egypt with his great power.
\v 15 When the Egyptian king stubbornly refused to let us go out from Egypt, the LORD killed every firstborn in Egypt — both humans and animals. Therefore, we must offer to the Lord every firstborn male of the cattle/herd and redeem each of our firstborn males.’ ('kita/our' should indicate human male offspring.)
\v 16 This celebration is a reminder for us at all times— like a sign tied to the hand and forehead— that the LORD has brought us out of Egypt with his great power.”
\s1 The Lord is leading His people
\p
\v 17 When the Egyptian king let the Israelites go, God did not guide them through the main road that crossed the land of the Philistines, even though the distance was closer. God said, “Were they to go that way and are attacked by enemies, it won't do for them to change (their) minds and return to Egypt.”
\v 18 So God made them go on a further path through the wilderness to the Red Sea. And the Israelites came out of Egypt ready to fight.
\p
\v 19 Moses brought Joseph's bones with him, because Joseph had made the Israelites promise, he said, “God will surely come and help you, and at that time you must take my bones out of Egypt.”
\p
\v 20 After leaving Succoth they camped at Etam, on the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 The Lord preceded them by day in the form of pillars of cloud to guide them on the road, and at night in the form of a pillar of fire to illuminate them, so that they could continue to travel during the day and night.
\v 22 Thus the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire at night was always with the Israelites.
