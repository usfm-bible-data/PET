\c 13
\s1 Statutes regarding firstborn children
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 “Set aside for me all the firstborn children in Israel. All who are born first— both humans and animals— are My possessions.”
\p
\v 3 Then Moses said to the people of Israel, “Remember that today is the day you came out of Egypt, from the place of slavery. The Lord has brought you out of Egypt with His great power. Remember this day by not eating leavened bread.
\v 4 Today, in the month of Abib, you came out of Egypt.
\v 5 You must commemorate this celebration in this month each year after the LORD takes you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, a rich and fertile land, according to His promise to your ancestors.
\v 6 You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the seventh day, hold a celebration to honor the Lord.
\v 7 For seven days, there should be no leavened bread or anything containing yeast in your entire territory.
\p
\v 8 That day, say to your sons, “I do all these things to commemorate what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.”
\v 9 Just as a writing can be tied to your hand or forehead as a reminder to you, so this celebration will be a reminder for you to always remind one another about the laws of the LORD. This celebration will remind you of the way the LORD brought us out of Egypt with His extraordinary power.
\v 10 Because of that, celebrate this statute every year at the appointed time.
\p
\v 11 The LORD will bring you into the land of the Canaanites and give the land to you, according to His promise to your fathers. When you live in that land,
\v 12 you must give over every firstborn male child and young male livestock so that it becomes the LORD's possession.
\v 13 But you can take back each of the young male donkeys by offering Me a lamb as its redemption. If you don't redeem it, you have to kill the donkey by breaking its neck. But you must redeem every firstborn son.
\p
\v 14 And at a later time, when your children ask, ‘What is the meaning of this custom?’ You must answer, ‘The LORD brought us out of slavery in Egypt with his great power.
\v 15 When the Egyptian king stubbornly refused to let us go out from Egypt, the LORD killed every firstborn male child in Egypt — both humans and animals. Because of that, we must offer to the Lord every firstborn male of the young of livestock and redeem each of our firstborn male children.’
\v 16 This celebration is a reminder for us at all times— like a sign tied to the hand and forehead— that the LORD has brought us out of Egypt with his great power.”
\s1 The LORD is leading His people
\p
\v 17 When the Egyptian king let the people of Israel go, God did not guide them by way of the main road that crossed the land of the Philistines, even though the distance was closer. God said, “If they were to go on that road and were attacked by enemies, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”
\v 18 So God made them go on a road that was farther crossing the wilderness to the Red Sea. And the Israelites came out of Egypt ready to fight.
\p
\v 19 Moses brought Joseph's bones with him, because Joseph had made the Israelites promise, saying, “God will surely come and help you, and at that time you must take my bones out of Egypt.”
\p
\v 20 After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham, on the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 The Lord preceded them by day in the form of a pillar of cloud to guide them on the road, and at night in the form of a pillar of fire to illuminate them, so that they could continue to travel during the day and night.
\v 22 In that way the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire at night was always with the Israelites.
