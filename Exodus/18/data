\s1 Jethro visits Moses
\p
\v 1 Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, a priest in Midian, already heard all that God did for His people, Israel, and for Moses, and how the LORD already brought them out of Egypt.
\p
\v 2 Jethro brought Zipporah, Moses’ wives that Moses sent home before,
\v 3 and his two sons, one was named Gershom, because Moses said, “I am a sojourner in a foreign land”,
\v 4 and the other one named Eliezer, because Moses said, “God my father is my rescuer and He saved me from the sword of the king of Egypt.”
\v 5 When the people of Israel were encamped in the wilderness at the foot of God’s mountain, which is Mount Sinai, Jethro brought Sipora and his two sons back to Moses.
\v 6 He said to Moses, “I, Jethro, your father-in-law, came to you together with children and your wife.”
\p
\v 7 Then Moses went out to meet his (father-)in-law and then hugged ang greeted him. After asking each of their healths, they entered into the camp.
\v 8 Moses told his (father-)in-law all that the LORD did to the king and people of Egypt for Israel, and also all the hardships that they faced along the journey, and how the LORD has saved them.
\v 9 Jethro is very happy to hear all the goodness that the LORD has done for Israel, who He saved from the hand of the Egyptians.
\p
\v 10 Jethro said, “Praise be the LORD, who saved you from the power of the Egyptians and king of Egypt!
\v 11 Now I know that the LORD is bigger than all gods, because He destroyed the Egyptianswhen they were arrogant against the people of Israel.”
\p
\v 12 Then Jethro offered burnt sacrifice and slaughtered sacrifice for God. And Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat together with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
\s1 Moses appointed judges over the nation of Israel
\p
\v 13 The next day, Moses sat to judge disputes among the nation of Israel, and that nation stood surrounding Moses from morning to evening.
\p
\v 14 When Moses’ (father-)in-law saw all that Moses did for that nation, he said, “What are you doing for this nation? Why only you alone that sit to judge while the whole nation stand around you from morning until evening?”
\p
\v 15 Said Moses to his (father-)in-law, “Because this nation comes to me to ask for direction from God.
\v 16 When there is a dispute among them, they come and I make a decision for them. I also tell them the statutes of God and His teachings.”
\p
\v 17 Said his (father-)in-law to him, “What you are doing is not good!
\v 18 You will make yourself and this nation tired, because this thing is to heavy for you. You cannot do this yourself.
\v 19 Now listen to my advice, and may God be with you: Be a representative for his people before God and bring their case to God.
\v 20 Teach them about the statutes and teachings of God and tell them the good way of life and what they should do.
\v 21 But choose from among that nation people who are able, people who fear and honor God, who are trustworthy, and who are determined to reject bribes. Appoitn them to be leaders over a thousand people, leaders over a hundred people, and leaders over ten people.
\v 22 They will judge the cases of that nation all the time. They will bring every large case to you, but let them judge the small cases, so they can carry this load together with you, to make it easier for you.
\v 23 But if you do this, and God tells you so, then you will be able to carry the load ofthis work, and the whole of this nation will go returnto their own homes peacefully.”
\p
\v 24 Moses listened to the advice of his (father-)in-law and did what he said.
\v 25 Moses chose able people from the whole of Israel, and he appointed them to be leaders over this nation, leaders over a thousand people, leaders over a hundred people, leaders over fifty people, and leaders over ten people.
\v 26 They judge the cases of that nation all the time. They only bring the difficult cases to Moses, while they solve the small cases among themselves.
\p
\v 27 Then Moses let his (father-)in-law depart to go home to his own land.
