\s1 The Israelites were oppressed in Egypt
\p
\v 1 Here are the children of Israel (also called Jacob) who went to Egypt along with their families:
\li2
\v 2-4 Ruben, Simeon, Levi,
\li2 Judah, Isachar, Zebulon,
\li2 Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali,
\li2 Gad and Asher.
\m
\v 5 The number of Jacob's family who participated in Egypt was seventy. Previously, Joseph was already in Egypt.
\p
\v 6 Time passed, Joseph and all his brothers and everyone from their generation died.
\v 7 The children of Israel gave birth to grandchildren and their numbers increased, so that they were very strong and scattered throughout Egypt.
\p
\v 8 After several generations passed, a new king who knew nothing about the story of Yusuf \f + \fr 1:8 \fk did not know anything about the story of Yusuf \ft Literally meaning "Didn't know Joseph". The point is (1) This new king did not know Joseph because the story of Joseph had happened hundreds of years before the new king came to power, and (2) Maybe the new king had heard about Joseph, but deliberately ignored Joseph's services against the people of Egypt. The kings who ruled in Joseph's time were from the Hexos who were enemies of the kings (of the native inhabitants of Egypt) the predecessor of this new king. After successfully driving away the hated foreign kings, the Egyptian hostility was then directed to all parties who had previously had close relations with the expelled party, especially the Hebrews who had tribal relations as well as positions with the rulers of Hexos. And now, with the increasing number of Israelis, this was seen as a serious threat to the government of the Egyptian king.\f* Began to rule over all of Egypt.
\v 9 The king said to his people, "Look, the Israelites are too many and because of that they are stronger than us.
\v 10 If one day the enemy attacks us, it is possible for them to join our enemies and then fight us and leave the country. Therefore we have to find a way so that they don't get more and more. "
\p
\v 11 They therefore placed the foremen of slave heads to oppress the Israelites by forced labor. The Israelites were forced to work hard to build the city of Pitom and the city of Ramses as a center for storing crops and other necessities for the king of Egypt.
\v 12 But the more Israelis were oppressed, the more their numbers increased and increasingly spread throughout the country. That made the Egyptians more afraid of them.
\v 13 Therefore the Egyptians enslaved them more cruelly.
\v 14 They forced the Israelites to work harder to make bricks, work on buildings, and do all the work in the fields. Thus they made the lives of the Israelites even more miserable.
\p
\v 15 Then the king of Egypt called the two midwives in charge of helping the Hebrew mothers during childbirth. They are named Sifra and Pua.
\v 16 The king said to them, "When you help the Hebrew mothers give birth, pay attention - if the sex of the baby is a woman, you may let her live. But if it's a man, then you have to kill him! "
\v 17 But the two midwives were afraid of God, so they did not obey the orders of the king of Egypt. They let all male babies born alive.
\p
\v 18 The king of Egypt called the midwives and said, "Why are you doing this? Why did you let all baby boys live? "
\p
\v 19 They answered, "Hebrew women are not the same as Egyptian women. They are very strong, so before the midwife arrives they have given birth. "
\p
\v 20-21 Because the midwives are afraid of God, God blesses them by giving them families and children. And the Israelites increasingly multiplied and became stronger.
\p
\v 22 Then the king of Egypt ordered all his people, "Every boy born to the Hebrews must be thrown into the Nile, while every baby girl may be left alive."
