\s1 The Israelites oppressed in Egypt
\p
\v 1 Here are the children of Israel (also called Jacob) who went to Egypt along with their families:
\li2
\v 2-4 Ruben, Simeon, Levi,
\li2 Judah, Isachar, Zebulun,
\li2 Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali,
\li2 Gad and Asher.
\m
\v 5 The number of Jacob’s family who went along to Egypt was seventy. Beforehand, Joseph was already in Egypt.
\p
\v 6 Time passed, Joseph and all his brothers and everyone from their generation died.
\v 7 The children of Israel bore grandchildren and their numbers greatly increased, so that they were very strong and scattered throughout all Egypt.
\p
\v 8 After several generations passed, a new king who knew nothing about the story of Yusuf \f + \fr 1:8\fk did not know anything about the story of Yusuf \ft Literally meaning “Didn't know Joseph”. This means (1) This new king truly did not know Joseph because the story of Joseph had happened hundreds of years before this new king came to power, and (2) It’s possible the new king had heard about Joseph, but deliberately ignored Joseph’s services for people of Egypt. The kings who ruled in Joseph’s time were from the Hexos people who were enemies of the kings (of the native inhabitants of Egypt) the predecessor of this new king. After successfully driving away the hated foreign kings, the Egyptian hostility was then directed to all parties who had previously had close relations with the expelled party, especially the Hebrews who had tribal relations as well as positions with the rulers of Hexos. And now, with the increasing number of Israelites, this was seen as a serious threat to the government of the Egyptian king.\f* began to rule over all of Egypt.
\v 9 The king said to his people, “Look, the Israelites are already too many and because of that they are already stronger than us.
\v 10 If one day the enemy attacks us, it is possible for them to join our enemies then fight us and leave this country. Therefore we have to find a way so that they don't increasingly grow.”
\p
\v 11 They therefore placed the foremen of slaves to oppress the Israelites by forced labor. The Israelites were forced to work hard to build the city of Pitom and the city of Ramses as a center for storing crops and other necessities for the king of Egypt.
\v 12 But the more the Israelites were oppressed, their numbers instead increased and increasingly spread throughout the country. That made the Egyptians more and more afraid of them.
\v 13 Therefore the Egyptians enslaved them more cruelly.
\v 14 They forced the Israelites to work harder to make bricks, work on buildings, and do all the work in the fields. Thus they made the lives of the Israelites more and more miserable.
\p
\v 15 Then the king of Egypt called the two midwives in charge of helping the Hebrew mothers during childbirth. Their names were Shiphrah and Puah.
\v 16 The king said to them, “When you help the Hebrew mothers give birth, pay attention — if the sex of the baby is a girl, you may let her live. But if a boy, then you must kill him!”
\v 17 However the two midwives feared God, so they did not obey the order of the king of Egypt. They let all male babies who were born live.
\p
\v 18 Then the king of Egypt called those midwives and said, “Why are you doing this? Why did you let all the male babies live?”
\p
\v 19 They answered, “Hebrew women are not the same as Egyptian women. They are very strong, so before the midwife arrives they have already given birth.”
\p
\v 20-21 Because the midwives feared God, God blessed them by giving them families and children. And the Israelites increasingly multiplied and became stronger.
\p
\v 22 Then the king of Egypt ordered all his people, “Every boy born to the Hebrews must be thrown into the Nile river, while every baby girl may be left alive.”
