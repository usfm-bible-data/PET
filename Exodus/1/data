\s1 The Israelites oppressed in Egypt
\p
\v 1 The following are the children of Israel who went along with their father to Egypt along with their families. (Their father, Jacob, had already been given a new name, which is Israel.)
\li2
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,
\li2
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan,
\li2
\v 4 Naphtali, Gad and Asher.

\v 5 The number of Jacob’s family at that time was seventy, including Joseph who had been a long time in Egypt.
\p
\v 6 Time passed, Joseph and all his brothers and everyone from their generation died.
\v 7 The children of Israel bore grandchildren and their numbers greatly increased, so that they were very strong and scattered throughout all Egypt.
\p
\v 8 After several generations passed, a new king who didn't know anything about the story of Joseph\f + \fr 1:8\fk did not know anything about the story of Yusuf \ft Literally meaning “Didn't know Joseph'. This means (1) This new king truly did not know Joseph because the story of Joseph had happened hundreds of years before this new king came to power, and (2) It’s possible the new king had heard about Joseph, but deliberately didn't care about Joseph’s service to the people of Egypt. The kings who ruled in Joseph’s time were from the Hexos people who were enemies of the kings (of the native inhabitants of Egypt) the predecessors of this new king. After successfully driving away the hated foreign kings, the Egyptian hostility was then directed to all parties who had previously had close relationships with the expelled party, especially the Hebrews who had tribal relationships as well as positions with the rulers of Hexos. And now, with the increasing number of Israelites, this was seen as a serious threat to the government of the Egyptian king.\f* began to rule over all of Egypt.
\v 9 The king said to his officials, “Look, the Israelites are already too many and because of that they are already stronger than us.
\v 10 If some time the enemy attacks us, it is possible for them to join with our enemies then fight us and leave this country. Because of that we have to find a way so that they don't increasingly grow.”
\p
\v 11 Because of that they placed foremen of slaves to oppress the Israelites by forced labor. The Israelites were forced to work hard to build the city of Pitom and the city of Ramses as a center for storing crops and other treasures of the king of Egypt.
\v 12 But the more the Israelites were oppressed, their numbers even increased and increasingly spread throughout the country. That made the Egyptians increasingly afraid of them.
\v 13 Because of that the Egyptians enslaved them more cruelly.
\v 14 They forced the Israelites to work harder to make bricks, work on buildings, plus doing all the work in the fields. Thus they made the lives of the Israelites more and more miserable.
\p
\v 15 Then the king of Egypt called the two Israelite\f + \fr 1:15 \fk Israelite \ft Literally the source language says 'the Hebrew'. The word Hebrew can be considered as identical with the nation of Israel, and the word Hebrew became the name for their language. TSI translates 'Ibrani' as 'Israel' where that word refers to the nation, and maintains 'Ibrani' (in the text) when that word refers to the language. See the footnote at Kej. 11:14.\f* women who worked as midwives in charge of helping the Israelite mothers while giving birth. Their names were Shiphrah and Puah.
\v 16 The king said to them, “When you help the Israelite mothers give birth, pay attention — if the sex of the baby is a girl, you may let her live. But if a boy, then you must kill him!”
\v 17 However the two midwives feared God, so they did not obey the order of the king of Egypt. They let all male babies who were born live.
\p
\v 18 Then the king of Egypt called those midwives and said, “Why are you doing this? Why did you let all the male babies live?”
\p
\v 19 They answered, “Israelite women are not the same as Egyptian women. They are very strong, so before the midwife arrives they have already given birth.”
\p
\v 20-21 Because the midwives feared God, God blessed them by giving them families and children. And the Israelites increasingly multiplied and became stronger.
\p
\v 22 Then the king of Egypt ordered all of his people, “Every boy born to the Israelites must be thrown into the Nile river, while every baby girl may be left alive.”
