\s Eighth disaster: Grasshopper
\p
\v 1 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go to the king, for I have hardened the hearts and hearts of the officials so that I can show My miraculous signs to them,
\v 2 and so that you can tell your grandchildren how my God has fooled the Egyptians, and about the miraculous signs that I have shown them. Thus you will know that I am the Lord. "
\p
\v 3 So Moses and Aaron went to the king and said to him, "The Lord, the God of the Hebrews said," Until when will you refuse to submit to Me? Let my people go to worship me.
\v 4 If you refuse, then tomorrow I will bring locusts to your land.
\v 5 The locusts will cover the entire surface of Egypt, so that the land is no longer visible. The grasshoppers will eat the remaining plants that have not been damaged by hail, also eat every tree in the field.
\v 6 Your houses and all the houses of officials of your government and the people of Egypt will be filled with grasshoppers. Your parents and ancestors have never seen anything similar.’” Then Moses immediately turned and left the king.
\p
\v 7 The king's officials said to him, "When will this person continue to trouble us? Let these people go so that they can worship the LORD their God. Are you not aware that Egypt has been destroyed? "
\p
\v 8 Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to face the king, and the king said to them, "Go and worship the LORD your God. But who of you will go? "
\p
\v 9 Moses answered, "We will go bring the young and the old. We will bring all of our families, as well as all our livestock, because we have to celebrate the Lord. "
\p
\v 10 But the king answered them, "It would be good for the Lord to be with you if I let you go bring your women and children!\f + \fr 10:10 \fk It would be good … \ft The words of the king of Egypt here were said with sarcasm. Even though he said the name of the LORD, he did not believe in Him, and his intention was to revile him.\f* I know you are putting together an evil plan!
\v 11 No way! Only the men can go and worship the Lord according to your request! "Then Moses and Aaron were expelled from before the king.
\p
\v 12 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Extend your hand over all Egypt, and the locusts will come and cover the whole surface of the land and eat every plant in Egypt which is not destroyed by hail.
\p
\v 13 So Moses stretched out his staff over all Egypt, and the Lord made the east wind blow throughout the land all day and night. The next morning, the east wind brought locusts.
\v 14 The locusts covered all of Egypt and perched on all the land. Previously there had never been so many grasshoppers, and after that it would never happen again.
\v 15 The surface of the land became dark because it was covered by many grasshoppers. Grasshoppers devoured all plants and fruits on trees that still survived hail. There were no green plants left in all of Egypt, be it plants or trees.
\p
\v 16 The king immediately called Moses and Aaron and said to them "I have sinned against the Lord, your God and also against you.
\v 17 I beg you just once, forgive my sin and ask the LORD, your God, that He will keep this death sentence away from me.
\p
\v 18 Moses left the king and begged the LORD.
\v 19 And the Lord turned the wind into a strong west wind that blew the locusts into the Red Sea. There is not a single locust left in all of Egypt.
\v 20 But the Lord again hardened the king's heart, and he again forbade the Israelites from leaving.
\s1 The ninth disaster: Darkness
\p
\v 21 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Lift your hands toward the heavens, and the great darkness will cover all the land of Egypt.
\v 22 Moses raised his hand to heaven and darkness covered all of Egypt for three days.
\v 23 The Egyptians cannot see each other or leave their homes for three days. But, there is light as usual in the house of Israel.
\p
\v 24 The king called Moses and said, "Go and worship the Lord. Your women and children may join, but all of your livestock must be left here. "
\p
\v 25 Moses answered, "You must let us take burnt sacrifices so that we may offer them to the LORD our God.
\v 26 We must bring all livestock. We will not leave anyone because we have to offer some of our livestock to the LORD, our God, and we do not know which one we will offer to the LORD before we get there.
\p
\v 27 But the Lord hardened the king's heart, so he did not let them go.
\v 28 The king said to Moses, "Go! Never come before me again, because when you see me, you will die! "
\p
\v 29 Moses said "Let it happen according to your words! I will never see your face again! "
