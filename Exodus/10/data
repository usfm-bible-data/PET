\s The eighth plague: Grasshoppers
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go before the king, for I have already hardened his heart and the hearts of the officials, so that I can show various miraculous signs to them,
\v 2 and so that you can tell your grandchildren how I your God have made a fool of the Egyptians, and about the miraculous signs that I have shown them. In that way you will know that I am the LORD.”
\p
\v 3 So Moses and Aaron went before the king and said to him, “The LORD, the God of the Hebrews says, ‘How long will you refuse to submit to Me? Let My people go to worship Me.
\v 4 If you still refuse, then tomorrow I will bring grasshoppers to your land.
\v 5 The grasshoppers will cover the entire surface of Egypt, so that the land is no longer visible. The grasshoppers will eat the remaining plants that were not damaged by the hail, also eating every tree in the field.
\v 6 Your houses and all the houses of the officials of your government and the people of Egypt will be filled with grasshoppers. Your parents and ancestors have never seen anything like this.’” Then Moses immediately turned and left the king.
\p
\v 7 The king's officials said to him, “How long will this person continue to trouble us? Let these people go so that they can worship the LORD, their God. Are you not aware that Egypt has been destroyed?”
\p
\v 8 Then Moses and Aaron were brought back before the king, and the king said to them, “Go and worship the LORD your God. But which of you will go?”
\p
\v 9 Moses answered, “We will go bringing the young and the old. We will bring all of our families, and also all our livestock, because we must hold a celebration to the LORD.”
\p
\v 10 But the king answered them, “It would be good for the LORD to accompany you if I let you go take your women and children!\f + \fr 10:10 \fk It would be good for the LORD … \ft The words of the king of Egypt here were said with sarcasm. Even though he said the name of the LORD, he did not believe in Him, and his intention was to revile Him.\f* I know you are arranging an evil plan!
\v 11 You can not! Only the men can go and worship the LORD according to your request!” Then Moses and Aaron were expelled from before the king.
\p
\v 12 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Extend your hand over all Egypt, so the grasshoppers will come and cover the whole surface of the land and eat every plant in Egypt which was not destroyed by hail.
\p
\v 13 So Moses stretched out his staff over all Egypt, and the LORD made the east wind blow throughout the land all day and night. The next morning, the east wind had brought grasshoppers.
\v 14 The grasshoppers covered all of Egypt and descended on all the land. Previously there had never been so many grasshoppers, and after that it would never happen again.
\v 15 The surface of the land became dark because it was covered by so many grasshoppers. The grasshoppers devoured all the plants and fruit on trees that still survived the hail. There were no green plants left in all of Egypt, both plants or trees.
\p
\v 16 The king immediately called Moses and Aaron and said to them “I have sinned against the LORD, your God and also against you.
\v 17 I beg you just this once, forgive my sin and ask the LORD, your God that He will distance this death sentence from me.”
\p
\v 18 Moses left the king and begged the LORD.
\v 19 And the LORD turned the direction of the wind into a strong west wind that blew the grasshoppers into the Red Sea. There was not a single grasshopper left in all of Egypt.
\v 20 However the LORD again hardened the king's heart, and he again forbade the people of Israel to leave.
\s1 The ninth plague: Darkness
\p
\v 21 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Lift your hand toward the heavens, and a great darkness will cover all the land of Egypt.
\v 22 Moses raised his hand towards heaven and darkness covered all of Egypt for three days.
\v 23 The people of Egypt could not see each other or leave their homes for three days. But, there was light as usual in the houses of the Israelites.
\p
\v 24 The king called Moses and said, “Go and worship the LORD. Your women and children may join, but all of your livestock must be left here.”
\p
\v 25 Moses answered, “You must let us take burnt sacrifices so that we may offer them to the LORD, our God.
\v 26 We must bring all the livestock. We will not leave even one animal because we have to offer part of our livestock to the LORD, our God, and we do not know which ones we will offer to the LORD before we get there.”
\p
\v 27 But the LORD hardened the king's heart, so he did not let them go.
\v 28 The king said to Moses, “Go! Don't ever come before me again, because when you see me, you will die!”
\p
\v 29 Moses said “Let it happen according to your words! I will never see your face again!”
