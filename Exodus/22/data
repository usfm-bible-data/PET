\s Regulations regarding repayment for stealing
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “If a person steals an ox or a sheep, then kills it and sells it, then he must replace the ox with five oxen, or a sheep with four sheep.
\p
\v 2 “If a thief is caught when entering someone’s house and he is killed, then the person who killed him is not guilty.
\v 3 But if that incident happens during the day time, then the murderer is guilty of that murder.
\p “A thief must repay the loss for all that he stole. But if he does not have anything to pay the loss, then he will be sold as a slave to pay for it.
\v 4 If an ox, donkey, or sheep that he stole is found with him in living condition, then he has to pay to reimburse the loss two fold.
\s Regulations regarding repayment for damages in the field
\p
\v 5 “If a person lets his livestock that is eating grass on his field or vineyard get lost and roam eating plants in other people’s field, then the owner of that livestock must repay for the losses to the owner of that field by giving the best harvest from his field or vineyard.
\p
\v 6 “If a person lights a fire and that fire devours thorn bushes and spreads to another person’s field, so that it burns piles of the produce of the wheat harvest or wheat plants in the field, or burns the whole field, then he must pay for the loss.”
\s Regulations regarding repayment for goods
\p
\v 7 If a person entrusts money or goods to his friend, and the entrusted (item) is stolen from his friend’s house, then if the thief is caught, he must pay double two fold to reimburse the loss.
\v 8 But if the thief is not caught, then the owner of that house must appear before the judges at My tent\f + \fr 22:8 \fk the judges at My tent \ft The word in Hebrew translated ‘the judges’ in this verse and verse 9 may also be translated as ‘before God’. In OT times, court cases like this were performed by judges from the tribe of Levi at the location of the LORD’s Tent.\f* so that they determine whether he has stolen his friend’s possessions or not.
\p
\v 9 “If two people have a dispute, each of them claiming to be the owner of an oxen, donkeys, sheep, clothing, or other lost goods, then both parties must appear before the judges at My tent. The guilty person must pay double to the real owner.
\p
\v 10 “If a person entrusts a donkey, ox, sheep, or other animal to his friend, and then the animal dies, is wounded, or seized by enemies, and no one saw what happened,
\v 11 then his friend must vow before the LORD that he did not take that animal. The owner of that animal must accept the vow of his friend and the friend does not need to reimburse for the loss.
\v 12 But if in fact the animal was stolen from his friend, then his friend must pay the owner to reimburse the loss.
\v 13 If it appears that the animal was attacked by a wild animal and he can show the carcass as evidence, then he does not have to pay to reimburse the loss of that animal.
\p
\v 14 “If someone borrows an animal from his friend, then the animal is wounded or dies when the owner is not there, then he must pay to reimburse the loss.
\v 15 But if the owner was there when it happened, then the borrower does not have to pay reimbursement. If that animal is a rental animal, then he does not need to reimburse because the rental money already enters in paying that loss.”
\s Regulations regarding sexual relations outside marriage
\p
\v 16 “If a man seduces a virgin who is not yet engaged and has intimate relations with her, then he must pay the dowry for that woman and marry her.

\p
