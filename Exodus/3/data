\v 2 There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the form of a flame in the midst of the bush. Moses saw that the bush was burning but not burning.
\v 3 Then Moses said, "How strange! Why isn't the bush burning? I will approach to see clearly. "
\p
\v 4 When the Lord saw Moses approaching, God said from the bush, "Moses, Moses!"
\p Moses answered, "Yes, I am here."
\p
\v 5 Then the Lord said, "Don't come near. Take off your footwear, because you are standing on holy land.
\v 6 I am the God worshiped by your father, and also that which your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob worshiped. "Then Moses hid his face, for fear of seeing God.
\p
\v 7 Then the Lord said, "I have clearly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and heard their call for the foreman's cruel treatment of them. I know their suffering,
\v 8 and I came to deliver them from the hands of the Egyptians. I will lead them out of the land and bring them to a fertile and vast country, which is abundant with natural products \f + fr 3: 8 
\abundant with natural products \ft This section is a figurative word in Hebrew which if translated literally means' flowing with milk and honey. \f * - that is to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Feris, Hivites, and Jebusites.
\v 9 The cry of the Israelites has come to Me, and I have seen how cruel the Egyptians oppressed them.
\v 10 Now, go away. I sent you to go to the king of Egypt to bring my people, the descendants of Israel out of Egypt. "
\p
\v 11 Moses answered God, "Who am I? I am nobody, how can I go to the king and bring the descendants of Israel out of Egypt? "
\p
\v 12 God answered, "I will be with you, and this is a sign for you, that I sent you. After you bring my people out of Egypt, you will worship Me on this mountain. "
\p
\v 13 Moses replied, "If I go to the people of Israel and say to them," The God of your ancestors has sent me to you, 'of course they will ask,' What is the name? 'So what should I answer? "
\p
\v 14 God answered Moses, "I am Me. Say to the people of Israel, "I have sent me to you."
\v 15 Say to the people of Israel, ‘LORD, \f + \fr 3:15 \fk LORD 
\ft. Literally, Hebrew says‘ YHWH ’. See TSI Preface for information about how TSI translates 'YHWH' and 'Adonai'. The name 'YHWH' has the same meaning as the words 'I am I' in verse 14. For further information see note in NET. 
\F * God of your ancestors, God of Abraham, Allah Isak and Allah Jacob has sent me to you. I am forever, and you must remember my name descending down.

\v 16 "Go and gather the elders of Israel and say unto them: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob has revealed himself to me and said, 'I have watched you and see how you are treated in Egypt .
\v 17 I promise to take you out of oppression in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Feris, Hivites and Jebusites, to a land which is abundant with natural products. '
\p
\v 18 "They will listen to you, and then you and the elders of Israel will go to the king and say to him, 'The Lord, the Hebrew God has met us, and now, allow us to travel for three days to the wilderness, so we can offer sacrifices to the Lord, our God. '
\p
\v 19 "I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go away unless forced by great power.
\v 20 I will use My power and strike Egypt with all My marvelous deeds. And after that he will let you go.
\v 21 I will move the hearts of the Egyptians so that they are kind to you, then you will not leave empty-handed.
\v 22 Every Israeli woman will ask for gold and silver jewelry, and clothes from her Egyptian neighbors, and from women who live in her house. You will wear the jewelry and clothes on your children, both men and women. Thus you will seize the treasures of the Egyptians."
