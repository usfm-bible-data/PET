\s1 The firey thorn bush that didn't burn up
\p
\v 1 One day, Moses was pasturing the sheep and goats owned by his father-in-law, Jethro\f + fr 3:1\fk Jethro \ft Moses’ father-in-law had two names, Jethro and Reuel. See note in Exod. 2: 18.\f* also known by the name Reuel, a priest in Midian. He drove his flock of animals across the wilderness and arrived at Mount Sinai\f + \fr 3: 1 \fk Mount Sinai \ft Literally, ‘Horeb’. TSI always translates ‘Horeb’ as ‘Mount Sinai’, because that name is better known by today’s readers.\f*— which is also called ‘the mountain of God’.
\v 2 There the angel sent by the LORD\f + \fr 3:2 \fk angel sent by the LORD \ft One of the characteristics of the books of Genesis and Exodus is that the writer often refered to ‘an angel’ to avoid directly mentioning that God did something that could be seen physically. As an example, an angel shows himself in this verse, but in verses 4 and 6, the LORD sees Moses approaching and says, “I am God ...” The writer was not always consistent in this. Sometimes the activity mentioned in one verse is done by an angel, but another verse says it was done by God Himself, and visa versa. The TSI will write the actor according to what is found in the source language. This characteristic can also be seen in Gen. 16:9-14; 22:11-18; 23:20-23; 31:11-13; Ex. 13:14-15, 13:21-22; 14:19-24; 32:34; 33:2; 48:16.\f* revealed Himself to Moses in the form of a flame of fire in the midst of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but it didn't burn up.
\v 3 Then Moses said, "How strange! Why isn't the bush burning up? I will approach to see clearly. "
\p
\v 4 When the Lord saw Moses approaching, God said from the bush, “Moses, Moses!“
\p Moses answered, “Yes, I'm here.“
\p
\v 5 Then the Lord said, “Don't come near. Take off your footwear, because you are standing on holy ground.
\v 6 I am the God worshiped by your father, and also the one your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob worshiped. “Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to see God.
\p
\v 7 Then the Lord said, “I have clearly seen the oppression of My people in Egypt and heard their cry for the foreman's cruel treatment of them. I know their suffering,
\v 8 and I've come to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians. I will lead them out of that land and bring them to a good and broad land, that abounds in nature's produce\f + \fr 3:8 \fk abounds in nature's produce \ft This part is a word analogy in the Hebrew language which if translated literally means 'flowing with milk and honey.' 'Milk' illustrates that the ground would be good for raising livestock, and 'madu' illustrates that the ground would be good for farming.\f*— that is to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
\v 9 The cry of the Israelites has reached Me, and I have witnessed how cruelly the Egyptians oppress them.
\v 10 Now, go. I'm sending you to face the king of Egypt to bring my people, the descendants of Israel out of Egypt."
\p
\v 11 Moses answered God, “Who am I? I am nobody. How can I face the king and bring the descendants of Israel out of Egypt?"
\p
\v 12 God answered, “I will be with you, and this is a sign for you, that I sent you. After you bring my people out of Egypt, you all will worship Me on this mountain. “
\p
\v 13 Moses replied, “If I go to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of our ancestors has sent me to you all,' they will certainly ask, 'What is his name?' So what should I answer? “
\p
\v 14 God answered Moses, “I am I. Say to the people of Israel that I am I has sent me to them.
\v 15 Tell them also, ‘The LORD, God of your ancestors, God of Abraham, God of Isak and God of Jacob has sent me to you.' All of that is My name forever. In that way you all will call My name going forward.
\p
\v 16 “Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them: The LORD, the God of our ancestors, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob has met me and said, 'I have paid attention to you all and have seen how you all have been treated in Egypt .
\v 17 I promise to bring you all out of oppression in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perrizites, Hivites and Jebusites, to a land which is abundant with natural produce. '
\p
\v 18 “They will listen to you, and then you and the elders of Israel will go face the king and say to him, 'The LORD, the Hebrew peoples' God has met with us. Because of that allow us to travel for three days to the wilderness, so we can offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'
\p
\v 19 “I know that the king of Egypt will not let you just leave unless forced by great power.
\v 20 So I will use My power and strike Egypt with all of My amazing deeds. And after that he will let you all go.
\v 21 I will move the hearts of the Egyptians so that they are kind to you all, so you all will not leave empty-handed.
\v 22 Every Israeli woman will ask for gold and silver jewelry, and clothes from her Egyptian neighbors, including any Egyptian women who live in that neighbor's house. You will put the jewelry and clothes on your children, both boys and girls. In that way you will take away the treasures of the Egyptians.“
