\s1 The thorny bush that burned
\p
\v 1 One day, Moses was pasturing the sheep and goats of his father-in-law, Jethro\f + fr 3:1\fk Jethro \ft Moses’ father-in-law had two names, Jethro and Reuel. See note in Exod. 2: 18.\f* also known by the name Reuel, a priest in Midian. He drove his flock across the wilderness and arrived at Mount Sinai\f + \fr 3: 1 \fk Mount Sinai \ft Literally, ‘Horeb’. TSI always translates ‘Horeb’ as ‘Mount Sinai’, because that name is better known by today’s readers.\f*— which is also called ‘the mountain of God’.
\v 2 There the angel of the LORD revealed himself to him in the form of a flame of fire in the midst of a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but it didn't burn up.
\v 3 Then Moses said, "How strange! Why isn't the bush burning up? I will approach to see clearly. "
\p
\v 4 When the Lord saw Moses approaching, God said from the bush, “Moses, Moses!“
\p Moses answered, “Yes, I'm here.“
\p
\v 5 Then the Lord said, “Don't come near. Take off your footwear, because you are standing on holy ground.
\v 6 I am the God worshiped by your father, and also the one your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob worshiped. “Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to see God.
\p
\v 7 Then the Lord said, “I have clearly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and heard their cry for the foreman's cruel treatment of them. I know their suffering,
\v 8 and I came to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians. I will lead them out of the land and bring them to a good and broad land, that is rich and fertile\f + \fr 3:8 \fk rich and fertile \ft This part is a word analogy in Hebrew which if translated literally means' flowing with milk and honey.\f*— that is to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
\v 9 The cry of the Israelites has reached Me, and I have witnessed how cruelly the Egyptians oppress them.
\v 10 Now, go. I'm sending you to face the king of Egypt to bring my people, the descendants of Israel out of Egypt. “
\p
\v 11 Moses answered God, “Who am I? I am nobody, how can I face the king and bring the descendants of Israel out of Egypt? “
\p
\v 12 God answered, “I will be with you, and this is a sign for you, that I sent you. After you bring my people out of Egypt, you will worship Me on this mountain. “
\p
\v 13 Moses replied, “If I go to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' they will certainly ask, 'What is his name?' So what should I answer? “
\p
\v 14 God answered Moses, “I am I. Say to the people of Israel, 'I am I has sent me to you.'
\v 15 Say to the people of Israel, ‘The LORD,\f + \fr 3:15 \fk LORD \ft Literally, Hebrew says ‘YHWH ’. See TSI Preface for information about how TSI translates 'YHWH' and 'Adonai'. The name 'YHWH' has the same meaning as the words 'I am I' in verse 14. For further information see note in NET.\f* God of your ancestors, God of Abraham, God of Isak and God of Jacob has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and you must remember my name going forward.
\p
\v 16 “Go and gather the elders of Israel and say to them: The LORD, the God of your ancestors, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob has revealed himself to me and said, 'I have paid attention to you and have seen how you have been treated in Egypt .
\v 17 I promise to bring you out of oppression in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perrizites, Hivites and Jebusites, to a land which is abundant with natural produce. '
\p
\v 18 “They will listen to you, and then you and the elders of Israel will face the king and say to him, 'The Lord, the Hebrew peoples' God has met with us, and now, allow us to travel for three days to the wilderness, so we can offer sacrifices to the Lord, our God. '
\p
\v 19 “I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go away unless forced by great power.
\v 20 I will use My power and strike Egypt with all of My amazing deeds. And after that he will let you go.
\v 21 I will move the hearts of the Egyptians so that they are kind to you, so you will not leave empty-handed.
\v 22 Every Israeli woman will ask for gold and silver jewelry, and clothes from her Egyptian neighbors, and from women who live in her house. You will put the jewelry and clothes on your children, both boys and girls. In that way you will take away the treasures of the Egyptians.“
