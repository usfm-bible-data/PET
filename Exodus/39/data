\s Making the priests' clothes
\p
\v 1 The priest's clothes are to be made of blue, purple and red wool to be worn by the priest the moment he serves in the Holy Room. The special clothing that is beautiful is also to be made for Aaron according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\s1 Making the ephod
\p
\v 2 Bezalel made the ephod from gold thread, and blue, purple and red wool thread, and fine linen cloth.\f + \fr 39:2 \ft See also Ex. 28:6-14\f*
\v 3 They made gold thread by making gold become a very thin thread-like strand. Then the gold thread was embroidered on fine linen cloth along with blue, purple and red wool thread.
\p
\v 4 The ephod was made in two parts— that is the front and back parts. Those two parts were connected by two shoulder coverings.
\v 5 The waist band that connected the ephod was made from the same material as the ephod, that is fine linen cloth that was embroidered by experts using gold thread and blue, purple, and red wool thread, according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\v 6 They tied two precious chrysoprase stones with woven gold thread. Those two precious stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel like a stone expert engraves a seal.
\v 7 Bezalel connected those two precious stones on the shoulder coverings on the ephod as memorial signs of the tribes of Israel, according to the LORD's orders to Moses.
\s1 Making the breast covering.p
\v 8 He also made the breast covering by embroidering gold thread, and blue, purple and red wool thread on fine linen cloth, artwork that was one with the ephod.
\v 9 The breast covering was square shaped and folded in two, with the length and breadth of 22 centimeters.
\v 10 They connected four rows of precious stones on the breast covering. The first row of stones consisted of pomegranate, chrysolyte, and emerald stones.
\v 11 The second row consisted of turquoise, sapphire, and diamond stones.
\v 12 The third row consisted of amber, white agate and amethyst stones.
\v 13 And the fourth row consisted of beryl, chrysoprase, and jaspar stones. Each precious stone was tied with gold.
\v 14 There were twelve precious stones and each precious stone symbolized one of the tribes of Israel and the name of that tribe was engraved on the precious stone like a seal.
\p
\v 15 They made two chains from pure gold that was braided like rope to associate the breast covering to the ephod.
\v 16 They also made two frames from woven gold and two gold chains. The two gold chains were connected to the two top corners of the breast covering.
\v 17 Next they connected the two gold chains to the two gold rings on the two corners of the breast covering.
\v 18 Then they connected/fastened the two other corners from the pure gold chain to the two frames of woven gold onto the shoulder covering of the ephod.
\v 19 Then they made two gold rings and connected them onto the two bottom corners of the breast covering, on the inside of the breast covering on the side of the ephod.
\v 20 Besides that, they also made two gold rings and connected them on the front part of the two shoulder coverings of the ephod, close to the sewn fold (hem?) near the bottom, on eleven (should be side - sebelah) above the waist band.
\v 21 Then they tied the ring on the bottom corner of the breast covering with the ring of the ephod using the blue colored rope, so that the breast covering was well connected to the ephod on top of the waist band without being able to shift. They did all of that according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\s1 Making the robe
\p
\v 22 Bezalel also made the robe from woven blue colored cloth to be worn under the ephod.
\v 23 The robe had to have a neck hole in the middle, and on the neck of the robe it was strengthened with woven tape so that it didn't tear easily.
\v 24 On the sewn fold/hem at the very bottom of the robe, they made decorations shaped like pomegranate fruit (pom-poms?) from blue, purple and red wool thread, and fine linen cloth.
\v 25 And they made bells from pure gold and connected alternately with the decorations in the shape of pomegranate fruit (pom-poms?) around the robe on it's sewn fold (hem?).
\v 26 In that way the bells and the pomegranate fruit alternated around the sewn fold. The robe would be worn by Aaron when he served the LORD, like the LORD had ordered to Moses.
\p
\v 27-28 They also made for Aaron and his sons robes, turbans and head ties of fine linen, also under clothes of fine spun linen.
\v 29 Their waist bands were made from fine linen and embroidered with blue, purple and red thread— according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\p
\v 30 Finally, they made a special medal of pure gold. On the front of it they engraved, "Holy for the LORD"— with the way an engraver would carve a stamp.
\v 31 That medal was tied to the turban with a blue colored rope, according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\s1 Moses examines all of the furnishings of the LORD's Tent
\p
\v 32 In that way they finished all of the work of building the Holy Tent. The Israelites did all of that according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\v 33 They brought all of the Holy Tent to Moses, that is
\li2 the tent with all of its furnishings, hooks, boards, cross bars, posts and foundation,
\li2
\v 34 the tent cover made of male sheepskins that were colored red and from fine leather, curtains that covered the Most Holy Room,
\li2
\v 35 the Chest of Promise with the carrying sticks, the chest cover,
\li2
\v 36 the table and all of its utensils, the serving bread,
\li2
\v 37 the branched lampstand and its utensils and oil for lighting,
\li2
\v 38 the golden altar, anointing oil, incense, the curtain for the opening door of the Holy Temple,
\li2
\v 39 the bronze altar with woven bronze wire, the carrying poles with all of its utensils, the vessel for cleansing and the pedestal,
\li2
\v 40 the curtain as the entrance door, the curtains for the courtyard, the supporting posts, the courtyard's gate curtain, the connecting cords, and tent pegs, and all the rest of the equipment for the Tent of Meeting.
\li2
\v 41 They also made clothing for the priests when they serve in the Holy Room— clothing that was made specifically for Aaron and his children.
\p
\v 42 In that way the Israelites did all the work according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\v 43 Moses examined the results of their work and felt satisfied because they had done according to the order of the LORD. Then Moses blessed them.
