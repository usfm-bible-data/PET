\s Making the priests' clothes\x + \xo 39:1 \xt Ex. 28:1-5\x*
\p
\v 1 According to the LORD's order to Moses, Bezalel and the skilled workers made special clothes for Aaron. Those clothes must be considered holy and are to be worn when he serves the LORD in His tent. All those clothes were made by weaving a beautiful pattern from thread of red, blue, and purple.
\s2 Making the ephod\x + \xo 39:2 \xt Ex. 28:6-14\x*
\p
\v 2 They wove the ephod from red, blue, and purple linen thread, decorated with gold thread.
\v 3 They made gold thread by hammering gold to become very thin sheets, and cutting them very thin so that they became like thread. Then the gold thread was used to decorate the pattern they wove with red, blue, and purple linen thread.
\p
\v 4 The ephod was made in two parts— that is the front and back parts. Those two parts were connected by two shoulder coverings.
\v 5 According to the LORD’s command to Moses, the waist band that connected the ephod was made from the same material as the ephod, that is fine linen cloth that was woven by experts using red, blue, and purple linen thread, and decorated with gold thread.
\v 6 They tied two precious chrysoprase stones with woven gold thread. Those two precious stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel like a stone expert engraves a seal.
\v 7 Bezalel connected those two precious stones on the shoulder coverings on the ephod as memorial signs of the tribes of Israel, according to the LORD's orders to Moses.
\s2 Making the breast covering\x + \xo 39:8 \xt Ex. 28:6-14\x*
\p
\v 8 He also made the breast covering which was woven from red, blue, and purple linen thread, and decorated with gold thread, which became an artistic work matching the ephod.
\v 9 The breast covering was square shaped and folded in two, with the length and breadth of 22 centimeters.
\v 10 They connected four rows of precious stones on the breast covering. The first row of stones consisted of pomegranate, chrysolyte, and emerald stones.
\v 11 The second row consisted of turquoise, sapphire, and diamond stones.
\v 12 The third row consisted of amber, white agate and amethyst stones.
\v 13 And the fourth row consisted of beryl, chrysoprase, and jaspar stones. Each precious stone was tied with gold.
\v 14 There were twelve precious stones and each precious stone symbolized one of the tribes of Israel and the name of that tribe was engraved on the precious stone like a seal.
\p
\v 15-18 “At the top part of the chest cover, they made an attachment in the form of two chains from pure gold that were braided like rope, together with two gold rings. A ring was sewn to the upper left corner of the chest cover, and another ring to the upper right corner, in order to tie the chest cover with those chains to two settings of the shoulder cover of the ephod.
\v 19 Then they made two gold rings and connected them onto the two bottom corners of the breast covering, on the inside of the breast covering on the side of the ephod.
\v 20 Besides that, they also made two gold rings and connected them on the front part of the two shoulder coverings of the ephod, close to the sewn fold (hem?) near the bottom, on eleven (should be side - sebelah) above the waist band.
\v 21 Then they tied the ring on the bottom corner of the breast covering with the ring of the ephod using the blue colored rope, so that the breast covering was well connected to the ephod on top of the waist band without being able to shift. They did all of that according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\s2 Making the blue robe\x + \xo 39:22 \xt Ex. 28:31-35\x*
\p
\v 22 The skilled workers made the robe which will be worn by Aaron under the ephod by weaving blue thread,
\v 23 with a thick/wide collar so that the robe would not tear easily.
\v 24-26 Around the very bottom the robe was wove with decorations shaped like pomegranate fruit from red, blue, and purple thread. And gold bells were attached alternating with those decorations. Aaron was required to wear that robe every time he served the LORD, according to what the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 27-28 They also made for Aaron and his sons robes, turbans and head ties of fine linen, also under clothes of fine spun linen.
\v 29 The waist bands for Aaron’s sons were also woven with a beautiful pattern from red, blue, and purple thread, according to the LORD's command to Moses.
\s2 The medal and the turban\x + \xo 39:30 \xt Kel. 28:36-38\x*
\p
\v 30 Finally, they made a special medal of pure gold. On the front of it they engraved, "Holy for the LORD"— with the way an engraver would carve a stamp.
\v 31 That medal was tied to the turban with a blue colored rope, according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\s2 Moses examines all of the furnishings of the LORD's Tent
\p
\v 32 In that way they finished all of the work of building the LORD’s Tent. The Israelites did all of that according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\v 33 They brought all of the LORD's Tent to Moses, that is
\li2 the tent with all of its furnishings, hooks, boards, cross bars, posts and foundation,
\li2
\v 34 the tent cover made of male sheepskins that were colored red and from fine leather, curtains that covered the Most Holy Room,
\li2
\v 35 the Chest of Promise with the carrying sticks, the chest cover,
\li2
\v 36 the table and all of its utensils, the offering bread,
\li2
\v 37 the branched lampstand and its utensils and oil for lighting,
\li2
\v 38 the golden altar, anointing oil, incense, the curtain for the opening door of the LORD's Tent,
\li2
\v 39 the bronze altar with woven bronze wire, the carrying poles with all of its utensils, the vessel for cleansing and the pedestal,
\li2
\v 40 the curtains for the courtyard, the supporting posts, the courtyard's gate curtain, all the connecting cords and their tent pegs, with all the rest of the other equipment for the Tent of Meeting.
\li2
\v 41 They also made clothing for the priests when they serve in the the LORD’s tent, which were clothes that showed that Aaron and his sons were performing a holy ministry for Me..
\p
\v 42 In that way the Israelites did all the work according to the LORD's order to Moses.
\v 43 Moses examined the results of their work and felt satisfied because they had done according to the order of the LORD. Then Moses blessed them.
