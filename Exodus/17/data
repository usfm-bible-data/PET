\c 17
\s1 Water gushing from the rock
\p
\v 1 Then all the people of Israel went on from the wilderness of Sin and moved from place to place, according to the Lord's command. They arrived and camped at Rephidim, but in that place there was no water to drink.
\v 2 So they demanded of Moses and said, “Give us water toa drink!” Moses answered, “Why are you demanding (of) me and testing the LORD?”
\p
\v 3 But the people were very thirsty and they murmured to Moses and said, “Did you bring us out of Egypt so that we, our children, and our livestock die of thirst?”
\p
\v 4 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What must I do to [deal with//confront] these people? Soon they will stone me!”
\p
\v 5 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go ahead of the the people and tell some of the leaders of Israel to come with you. Also bring the walkingstick that you used to hit the Nile.
\v 6 I will stand before you there, on a rock on Mount Sinai.\f + \fr 17: 6 \fk Sinai \ft Literally, ‘Horeb’. See note in chapter 3:1.\f* Hit the stone, and water will come out so that the people can drink.”
\p So Moses did that in front of the leaders of Israel.
\p
\v 7 Moses named the place Masa and Meriba,\f + \fr 17: 7 \fk Masa and Meriba \ft Masa meant 'to test' and Meriba meant 'to oppose'.\f* because there the Israelites complained and tested the LORD by saying, “Is the Lord with us or not?”
\s The nation of Israel defeated the Amalekite nation
\p
\v 8 In Rafidim, the Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites.
\v 9 So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of us and go out against the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of [a//the] hill with God's stick in my hand.”
\p
\v 10 Joshua did what Moses told him to. He made war against the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
\v 11 As long as Moses raised his hand, the Israelites were stronger, but if he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were stronger.
\v 12 Some time later, Moses' hands became tired. So Aaron and Hur took a stone for Moses to sit, and they supported both of Moses' hands, so that both of his hands were continually raised until the sun went down.
\v 13 So Joshua defeated the Amalekite army in that war.
\p
\v 14 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this event in a book so that this event will continue to be remembered, and say to Joshua, that I will erase all memories of the Amalekites from this world.”
\p
\v 15 Then Moses built an altar and named it, “The LORD is my flag of victory.”
\v 16 Moses said, "Lift high the flag of the LORD's victory! The LORD will fight against the Amalekites for generations.”
