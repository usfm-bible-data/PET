\c 36
\p
\v 1 "The Lord gave ability and wisdom to Bezalel, Aholiab, and all of the other expert craftsmen to do all of the work in building the Holy Tent. They have to do it according to the LORD's orders."
\p
\v 2 So Moses called Bezalel and Aholiab, along with all each of the craftsmen whom were given expertise by the LORD and whose hearts were moved to do that work,
\v 3 and they received from Moses all of the offerings that were given by the Israelites to build the holy tent. But after that the Israelites kept bringing freewill offerings to Moses everyday.
\v 4 So all of the expert craftsmen who were working to make the Holy Tent left their work and came to Moses.
\v 5 They said, "The people brought way more than is needed for the work that the LORD ordered!"
\p
\v 6 So Moses announced to the whole encampment, "Don't let anyone, either woman or man, bring other offerings for the work of building the Holy Tent." So the people didn't bring any more offerings,
\v 7 because all of the materials to build the Holy Tent had been gathered and even more.
\s Building the Holy Tent
\p
\v 8 Then the skilled people among the craftsmen built the Holy Tent with ten curtain sheets. the curtains were made of fine linen cloth with pictures of winged creatures embroidered with wool thread colored blue, purple, and red.
\v 9 Each curtain sheet measured exactly the same, that is 12 meters long and 2 meters wide.
\v 10 Those curtains are to be joined/connected to become two long series/chains. Each series will consist of five curtains.
\v 11 On the two chained curtains, they made hook holes from blue thread the length of the outside of the chained curtains.
\v 12 Fifty hook holes were made that faced each other on each chain.
\p
\v 13 Then they made fifty hooks from gold to be hooked to each hook hole on the two chained curtains, so that the Holy Tent became one unit.
\v 14 Then they made eleven curtain sheets of goat hair to cover the Holy Tent.
\v 15 Each curtain sheet measured exactly the same, that is 14 meters long and 2 meters wide.
\v 16 And sewn to become one chain, each five curtain sheets and six curtain sheets.
\v 17 They made fifty hook holes on the outside length of the two curtain chains.
\v 18 And fifty bronze hooks were made to connect the two curtain chains so that they became one unit.
\v 19 They also made a covering cloth of ram's skin that was colored red and on top ot that another cloth covering made from fine leather.
\p
\v 20 Then they made the Holy Tent's frame from acacia wood.
\v 21 Each frames length was 4 meters and width was 66 sentimeters.
\v 22 Each frame had two bolts beneath it to stand up those frames.
\v 23 They made twenty frames on the south part of the Holy Tent,
\v 24 with forty bases of silver, two bases for each frame.
\v 25 They also made twenty frames for the north part of the Holy Tent,
\v 26 and forty bases of silver, two for each frame.
\v 27 For the back side of the Holy Tent, on the west side, they made six frames.
\v 28 They also made two farmes for the two corners on the backside of the Holy Tent.
\v 29 The two corner fames will be separated at the bottom part but connected at the top part with a bracelet. In that way the corner frames were made.
\v 30 All of it had eight frames for the west part of the Holy Tent, supported by sixteen bases from silverâ€” for each frame.
\v 31 Then they made cross bars from acacia wood and connected them across the frames, five cross bars for the north side of the Holy Tent,
\v 32 five cross bars for the south side, and five more for the back side of the Holy Temple that faced west.
\v 33 The middle cross bars were connected to the middle part of frames and crossed from one end to the other end.
\v 34 They covered the frames and cross bars with gold and made gold bracelets to support each cross bar.
\p
\v 35 For the inside of the Holy Tent, they made special curtains from fine linen cloth with pictures of winged creatures embroidered with wool thread colored blue, purple, and red.
\v 36 These curtains were hung with several gold hooks on four acacia wood posts covered with gold, on top of silver bases.
\v 37 They also made the tent door curtain from fine linen cloth that was embroidered with wool thread colored blue, purple, and red.
\v 38 This curtain was hung with hooks from five acacia wood posts covered with gold, on top of five bronze posts.
