\s The Incense Altar
\p
\v 1 "Make an altar from acacia wood for burning incense.
\v 2 Its shape is square with side lengths of 45 centimeters and a height of 90 centimeters. On the four sides are horns that are one with the altar.
\v 3 You have to cover its upper part, its four sides, its horns with pure gold— and make a gold frame around it.
\v 4 Make two gold bracelets and connect to the bottom of that frame, on two sides. The carrying poles will be inserted into the holes of those bracelets so that the altar can be carried.
\v 5 The carrying poles have to be made from acacia wood and covered with gold.
\v 6 The incense will be placed outside the curtain that is in front of the Most Holy Place. The Most Holy Place is where I will meet with you, Moses, or the high priest when he serves Me before the Throne of Reconciliationn.
\p
\v 7 "Aaron has to burn fragrant incense on that altar every morning, when he cleans the lamps,
\v 8 and every evening, when he lights the lamps. The offering of incense has to be done before the LORD routinely, from one generation to another.
\v 9 The incense offered on this special altar must be that which is made especially for use in My tent.\x + \xo 30:9 \xt Ex. 30:34-38\x* Don't use th altar to offer other things, including burnt sacrifices, wheat offerings, or wine.
\p
\v 10 Once a year Aaron has to purify the incense altar by rubbing a little blood from the sacrifice to erase sin on its horns. That ceremony has to be done every year from generation to generation, because this altar is very holy to the LORD."
\s Peace Money
\p
\v 11 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 12 When you perform a census to count the total of Israelites, then every male has to pay the peace money to redeem each of their lives to the LORD when you count them. So then, a plague won't fall on them when you count them.
\v 13 Every male that is counted in the census has to pay six grams of silver as an offering to the LORD. The payment is to be weighed according to the official measure of weight, that is the shekel that is saved in the LORD’s Tent. One shekel is equal to 12 grams.
\v 14 Every male that is age 20 years and above has to be counted in the census and has to pay the offering to the LORD.
\v 15 Both rich and poor people must pay the same amount, to make peace for their lives.
\v 16 You will receive the peace money from the nation of Israel and will use it for service in My tent. In that way, I will remember the nation of Israel and will make peace for their lives."
\v 17 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 18 "Make also a water storage basin from bronze with its base from bronze for rinsing/washing. Place it between My tent and the altar, and fill with water.
\v 19 Aaron along with his children will wash their hands and feet with that water.
\v 20-21 They have to wash their hands and feet with water when they enter the tent, or approach the altar to burn offerings to Me so that they won't die. That will become a statute for Aaron and his descendants from generation to generation forever."
\s1 The Anointing Oil
\p
\v 22 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 23 “Make minyak for anointing from the best fragrant-spices:
\li2 6 kilograms of myrrh oil,
\li2 3 kilograms of cinnamon,
\li2 3 kilograms of lemon grass stalks,
\li2
\v 24 4 liters of olive oil,
\li2 and 6 kilograms of teja wood.
\m All these are to be weighed according to the official measure of weight that is saved in the My tent.
\m
\v 25 From those ingredients, make the holy anointing oil, like the work of an expert perfume maker. That oil will be set apart for ministry for Me.
\v 26 "With that oil you will anoint the My tent, the Covenant Box,
\v 27 the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
\v 28 the altar for burned sacrifices and its utensils, and the water storage basin with its footings.
\v 29 Set apart all of that to become very holy, so that whatever touches them also becomes holy.
\p
\v 30 Anoint Aaron and his children with that oil, so that they are set apart to serve as My priests.
\v 31 And you have to say to the Israelites: 'This is the LORD's anointing oil that is holy through all of your descendants.
\v 32 This oil can't be rubbed on the body of an ordinary person, and you all can't make oil like this oil. This oil is holy, and must only be used in ministry for Me.
\v 33 Whoever makes a mixture of oil like this or uses it on a person other than a priest, he must no longer be considered one of my people.’”
\s Incense
\p
\v 34 The LORD said to Moses, "Take these spices:
\li2 damar resin,
\li2 lokan bark,
\li2 rasamala resin,
\li2 and pure incense,
\m each in the same amount,
\v 35 and mix it all to become incense, like what an expert mixer of incense makes. That incense has to be mixed with salt, pure and holy.
\v 36 Pound some of that incense finely and place it in front of the Covenant Box. That is the place where I will meet with you or the High Priest in My tent. That incense must always be considered and used as something which is very holy.
\v 37 And don't make a mixture of that same incense for yourselves. That incense is especially for My worship, and you all have to treat it as something holy.
\v 38 Whoever makes incense like that for himself to enjoy its fragrance, will no longer be considered as (one of) my people.”
