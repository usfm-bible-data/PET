\s The Incense Altar
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD spohe to Meses, “Make an altar from acacia wood for burning incense.
\v 2 Its shape will be like a table that is square, with the length of every side 45 centimeters. The height of it will be 90 centimeters. On the four sides of the table, make shapes like cow horns that protrude directly from the same wood as the top of that table.
\v 3 Cover all of that with pure gold, including the upper part of the altar, its four sides, and its horns. Also make a gold frame around it.
\v 4 So that it can be carried, make two gold bracelets and connect to the bottom of that frame, in the middle of two opposite sides. Carrying poles will be inserted into the holes of those bracelets.
\v 5 The carrying poles will also be be made from acacia wood and covered with gold.
\v 6 The incense will be placed outside the curtain that is in front of the Most Holy Place. The Most Holy Place is where I will meet with you, or the high priest when he serves Me before the Throne of Reconciliation.
\p
\v 7 "Aaron has to burn fragrant incense on that altar every morning, when he sees to the lamp wicks,
\v 8 and every evening, when he lights the lamps. The offering of incense has to be done before the LORD routinely, from one generation to another.
\v 9 The incense offered on this special altar must be that which is made especially for use in My tent.\x + \xo 30:9 \xt Ex. 30:34-38\x* Don't use th altar to offer other things, including burnt sacrifices, wheat offerings, or wine.
\p
\v 10 Once a year, on the day that the reconciliation sacrifice is made for all of Israel,\x + \xo 30:10 \xt Lev. 23:28-32\x* Aaron has to purify rub a little blood from that sacrifice on the horns of this incense altar. That ceremony has to be done every year from generation to generation, because in this way this altar is made holy for My service."
\s Peace Money
\p
\v 11 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 12 “When you perform a census to count the total of Israelites, then every male has to pay the peace money to redeem each of their lives to the LORD when you count them. If that is done, I won’t punish them with a plague because ofethat census.
\v 13 Every male that is counted in the census has to pay six grams of silver as an offering to the LORD. The payment is to be weighed according to the official measure of weight, that is the shekel that is saved in the LORD’s Tent. One shekel is equal to 12 grams.
\v 14 Every male that is age 20 years and above has to be counted in the census and has to pay the offering to the LORD.
\v 15 Whether one is rich or poor, they must pay the same amount, to make reconcilliation in my sight for their lives.
\v 16 You will receive the reconcilliation money from the nation of Israel, and you will use it for service in My tent. In that way, I will be favorable to the people and will consider that they each are at peace with Me.”
\v 17 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 18 "Make a basin for water for rinsing with its base. Both of these wiln be made from bronze. This basin wiln be placed between My tent and the altar.
\v 19 Aaron along with his children will wash their hands and feet with that water.
\v 20-21 They have to wash their hands and feet with water when they enter the tent, or approach the altar to burn offerings to Me. This rinsing is a requirement for them, so that they do not die in the performance of their duties. This will become a statute for Aaron and his descendants from generation to generation forever."
\s1 The Anointing Oil
\p
\v 22 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 23 “Make minyak for anointing from the best fragrant-spices:
\li2 6 kilograms of myrrh oil,
\li2 3 kilograms of cinnamon,
\li2 3 kilograms of lemon grass stalks,
\li2
\v 24 4 liters of olive oil,
\li2 and 6 kilograms of teja wood.
\m All these are to be weighed according to the official measure of weight that is saved in the My tent.
\m
\v 25 From those ingredients, make the holy anointing oil, like the work of an expert perfume maker. This oil is holy, and must only be used in ministry for Me.
\v 26 "With that oil you will anoint the My tent, the Covenant Box,
\v 27 the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
\v 28 the altar for burned sacrifices and its utensils, and the water storage basin with its footings.
\v 29 Anoint all of that in order that it becomes holy, so that whatever touches them will also become holy or behalf of service for Me.
\p
\v 30 Anoint Aaron and his children with that oil, so that they are set apart to serve as My priests.
\v 31 And you have to say to the Israelites: ‘According to the LORD’s command, we will forever regard this anointing oil as very holy, and only to be used in service to the LORD.
\v 32 This oil can't be rubbed on the body of an ordinary person, and you all can't make oil like this oil. This oil is holy, and must only be used in ministry for Me.
\v 33 Whoever makes a mixture of oil like this or uses it on a person other than a priest, he must no longer be considered one of my people.’”
\s Incense
\p
\v 34 The LORD said to Moses, “Make incense with these spices:
\li2 damar resin,
\li2 lokan bark,
\li2 rasamala resin,
\li2 and pure incense,
\m each in the same amount,
\v 35 and mix it all to become incense, like what an expert mixer of incense makes. That incense has to be mixed with salt. Let this mixture always be pure and regarded as holy.
\v 36 Pound a little of that incense very finely and place it in front of the Covenant Box. That is the place where I will meet with you, or the High Priest on duty in My tent. That incense must always be considered and used in ministry for Me.
\v 37 And don't make a mixture of that same incense for yourselves. That incense is especially for My worship, and you all have to treat it as something holy.
\v 38 Whoever makes incense like that for himself to enjoy its fragrance, will no longer be considered as (one of) my people.”
