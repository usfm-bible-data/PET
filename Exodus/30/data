\s The Incense Altar
\p
\v 1 "Make an altar from acacia wood for burning incense.
\v 2 Its shape is square with side lengths of 45 centimeters and a height of 90 centimeters. On the four sides are horns that are one with the altar.
\v 3 You have to cover its upper part, its four sides, its horns with pure goldâ€” and make a gold frame around it.
\v 4 Make two gold bracelets and connect to the bottom of that frame, on two sides. The carrying poles will be inserted into the holes of those bracelets so that the altar can be carried.
\v 5 The carrying poles have to be made from acacia wood and covered with gold.
\v 6 You have to place the incense altar in the part outside of the curtain that is in front of the Chest of Promise and its cover, where I will meet with you.
\p
\v 7 "Aaron has to burn fragrant incense on that altar every morning, when he cleans the lamps,
\v 8 and every evening, when he lights the lamps. The offering of incense has to be done before the LORD routinely, from one generation to another.
\v 9 Don't offer foreign incense, or burnt sacrifices, or wheat offerings on this altar, and don't pour wine offerings on it.
\p
\v 10 Once a year Aaron has to purify the incense altar by rubbing a little blood from the sacrifice to erase sin on its horns. That ceremony has to be done every year from generation to generation, because this altar is very holy to the LORD."
\s Peace Money
\p
\v 11 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 12 When you perform a census to count the total of Israelites, then every male has to pay the peace money to redeem each of their lives to the LORD when you count them. So then, a plague won't fall on them when you count them.
\v 13 Every male that is counted in the census has to pay six grams of silver as an offering to the LORD. The payment is weighed according to the official measure of weight, which is the shekel. One shekel is equal to 12 grams.
\v 14 Every male that is age 20 years and above has to be counted in the census and has to pay the offering to the LORD.
\v 15 Both rich and poor people must pay the same amount, to make peace for their lives.
\v 16 You will receive the peace money from the nation of Israel and will use it for service in the Holy Tent\f + \fr 30:16 \fk Holy Tent \ft Literally the Tent of Meeting, the same is also in Ex. 30:18, 26 & 36.\f* In that way, I will remember the nation of Israel and will make peace for their lives."
\v 17 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 18 "Make also a water storage basin from bronze with its footing from bronze to wash. Place it between the Holy Tent and the altar, and fill with water.
\v 19 Aaron along with his children will wash their hands and feet with that water.
\v 20-21 They have to wash their hands and feet with water when they enter the Holy Tent, or approach the altar to burn offerings to the LORD so that they won't die. That will become a statute for Aaron and his descendants from generation to generation forever."
\s1 The Anointing Oil
\p
\v 22 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 23 "Take the best fragrant-spices and tree sap,
\li2 explicitly 6 kilograms of myrrh oil, 3 kilograms of cinnamon, and 3 kilograms of lemon grass stalks,
\li2
\v 24 and 6 kilograms of teja wood, all weighed with the official weight, and 4 liters of olive oil.
\m
\v 25 From those ingredients, make the holy anointing oil, like the work of an expert perfume maker.
\v 26 "With that oil you will anoint the Holy Tent, the Chest of Promise,
\v 27 the table and its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,
\v 28 the altar for burned sacrifices and its utensils, and the water storage basin with its footings.
\v 29 Set apart all of that to become very holy so that whatever touches them also becomes holy.
\p
\v 30 Anoint Aaron and his children with that oil, so that they are set apart to serve as My priests.
\v 31 And you have to say to the Israelites: 'This is the LORD's anointing oil that is holy through all of your descendants.
\v 32 This oil can't be rubbed on the body of an ordinary person, and you all can't make oil like this oil. This oil is holy, and you all have to treat it as holy.
\v 33 Whoever makes a mixture of oil like this or uses it on a person other than a priest has to be sentenced to die.'"
\s Incense
\p
\v 34 The LORD said to Moses, "Take these spices:
\li2 tree resin, lokan bark, rasamala resin and pure incense, each in the same amount,
\m
\v 35 and mix it all to become incense, like what an expert mixer of incense makes. That incense has to be mixed with salt, pure and holy.
\v 36 Pound some of that incense finely and place it in front of the Chest of Promise in the Holy Tent, where I will meet with you. You all have to treat that incense as very holy.
\v 37 And don't make a mixture of that same incense for yourselves. That incense is especially for the LORD and you all have to treat it as holy.
\v 38 Whoever makes incense like that for himself to enjoy its fragrance, will be wiped out from among his nation."
