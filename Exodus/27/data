This altar was made from wood so that it could be moved.\f* from acacia wood shaped square , with the length measurement of 2.2 meters, and width of 2.2 meters, and height of 1.3 meters.\f + \fr 27:1 \fk meter measurement \ft Literally, "five hastas long and five hastas wide, … three hastas high."\f*
\v 2 Chisel the shape of four horns at the four corners on top of the altar, so that the horns are one with the altar. Then cover all of the altar with bronze.
\v 3 Make all of the altar's equipment from bronze, several ash containers, shovels, basins, meat hooks, and charcoal holders.
\v 4-5 Make a surface from thick bronze with holes to hold the burning wood. The position of that surface inside the altar is at half the height of the altar. And on the outside of the altar, attach four bracelets made from bronze on every corner of the altar as a place to put two carrying poles.
\v 6 Make carrying poles also for the altar from acacia wood, and cover the poles with bronze.
\v 7 When it is needed to carry the altar away, the two poles will be inserted into the bracelets on the left and right sides of the altar.
\v 8 So the altar will be shaped like an empty box, like what was shown to you on top of the mountain.”
\s1 The fence around the courtyard of the LORD’s Tent
\p
\v 9-11 “Make the courtyard for the My tent. The courtyard will be given a fence around it, with curtains that are made from fine linen cloth. The curtains for the south and north sides will each be 46 meters long. On each sides, hang the curtains on twenty posts using clasp holes and silver connectors. Every post will stand one bronze base.
\v 12 On the back side of the tent, that is on the west, the width of the curtains will be 23 meters, and hung on ten posts which will be attached to ten bases.
\p
\v 13 The gateway to the LORD’s tent will be located on the east side, and that side will also be 23 meters.
\v 14-15 The entrance gateway will be in the middle of that side, midway between two sets of curtains at the far left and right, which are each 6.9 meters long. The two curtains will be hung on three posts that stand on three bases.
\v 16 For the courtyard's gate door which is in the middle of that side, weave a curtain with a beautiful pattern from linen thread colored red, blue, and purple. That curtain will hang from four posts that are placed on four bases.
\p
\v 17 The top of all the posts around the courtyard will have a connecting ring, used as a place to connect hooks made from silver. The bases for the posts will be made from bronze.
\v 18 So the whole courtyard will measure 46 meters long and 23 meters wide. The height of the curtains being 2.3 meters, and woven from linen thread. All the bases for the posts will be made from bronze.
\v 19 All of the equipment of the My tent, including all of the pegs anchored to the ground to tie ropes holding the courtyard fence, will be made of bronze.”
