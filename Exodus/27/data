\s1 The altar for burnt offering
\p
\v 1 "Make an altar\f + fr 27:1 \fk altar \ft Altar was a place to offer animal sacrifice to God. This altar was made from wood so that it could be moved.\f* from acacia wood shaped square , with the length measurement of 2.2 meters, and width of 2.2 meters, and height of 1.3 meters.\f + \fr 27:1 \fk meter measurement \ft Literally, "five hastas long and five hastas wide, … three hastas high."\f*
\v 2 Shape four horns at the four corners on top of the altar in such a way that the horns are one with the altar. Then cover all of the altar with bronze.
\v 3 Make all of the altar's equipment from bronze, several ash containers, shovels, basins, meat hooks, and charcoal holders.
\v 4-5 Make a surface from thick bronze with holes to hold the burning wood. The position of that surface inside the altar is at half the height of the altar. And on the outside of the altar, attach four bracelets made from bronze on every corner of the altar as a place to put two carrying poles.
\v 6 Make carrying poles also for the altar from acacia wood, and cover the poles with bronze.
\v 7 To carry the altar away, the two poles will be inserted into the bracelets on the left and right sides of the altar.
\v 8 So the altar will be shaped like an empty box, like what was shown to you on top of the mountain.”
\s1 The fence around the courtyard of the LORD’s Tent
\p
\v 9-11 “Make the courtyard for the My tent. The courtyard will be given a fence around it, consisting of curtains that are made from fine linen cloth. The curtains for the south and north sides will each be 46 meters long. On each sides, hang the curtains on twenty posts using clasp holes and silver connectors. Every post is to be attached one bronze base.
\v 12 On the back side of the tent, [the width] of the curtains will be 22 meters, and hung on ten posts which will be attached to ten bases.
\p
\v 13 On the east side, where there is a gate door, the width of the courtyard is also 23 meters.
\v 14-15 So that the entrance gateway is in the middle of the east side, there will be two sets of curtains at the far left and right which are each 6.9 meters wide. The two curtains will be hung on three posts that are placed on three bases.
\v 16 For the courtyard's gate door which is in the middle of that side, make a curtain from fine linen with the length of 9 meters, and decorated with blue, purple and red colored embroidery. That curtain will hang from four posts that are placed on four bases.
\p
\v 17 All of the posts around the courtyard each have to be provided with connecting rings and hooks made from silver. The posts' bases have to be made from bronze.
\v 18 So, the whole courtyard will measure 44 meters long and 22 meters wide, with the height of the curtains being 2.3 meters, being made from fine linen cloth and with posts made from bronze.
\v 19 All of the equipment of the My tent, including all of the pegs anchored to the ground to tie ropes holding the courtyard fence, will be made of bronze.”
\s1 Oil for the lamps
\p
\v 20 “Command the people of Israel to bring to you pure olive oil for the lamps, so that the lamps burn continuously.
\v 21 Aaron and his children are responsible to guard so that the lamps in the My tent in front of the Most Holy Room curtain burn continuously before Me, from evening to morning. This is a statute that lasts for the nation of Israel from generation to generation.
