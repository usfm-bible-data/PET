\s1 Moses and Aaron face the king of Egypt
\p
\v 1 After that Moses and Aaron went before the king of Egypt and said to him, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says, ‘Let my people go, so that they can hold a celebrate for Me in the wilderness.’”
\p
\v 2 But the king of Egypt replied, “Who is the Lord so that I must obey His commands and let the Israelites go. I don’t know the LORD, and I also won't let the Israelites go.”
\p
\v 3 Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met us. We beg you, allow us to go and make this journey for three days to the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, so that He does not punish us with plague or war.”
\p
\v 4 But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you disturb the work of those people? Let them work!
\v 5 The number of your people is very large now, and now you deliberately make them stop working!”
\s1 The Israelites are increasingly oppressed
\p
\v 6 That same day, the king of Egypt ordered the foremen of Egypt and the foreman of Israel, saying,
\v 7 “From now on, you may not give straw to the slaves to make bricks like before — let them go gather it themselves.
\v 8 But make sure that the number of bricks they produce every day remains the same as before. Truly they are lazy, therefore they demand while saying, ‘Let us go to offer sacrifices to our God’.
\v 9 Force them to work harder, so that they are busy with work so there is no time to listen to those false words.”
\p
\v 10 Then all the foremen of Egypt and the foreman of Israel went and said to the Israelites, “The king has determined that he will not provide any more straw for brick making.
\v 11 So go and look for straw from anywhere, but you have to keep producing as much brick as in the previous days. It can't decrease even a little!”
\v 12 So the people of Israel spread out to search for straw throughout the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 13 And the Egyptian overseers pressed them by saying, “Complete your daily work just as before when the straw was still provided.”
\v 14 The Egyptian foremen beat the Israeli foremen, who were given the responsibility for the work of the Israelites. They asked, “Why didn't you produce as many bricks as before?”
\p
\v 15 Then the Israeli foremen approached the king and begged, “my Lord the King, why do you treat us, your servants like this?
\v 16 Now we are not given straw but we are still required to make bricks. Your own people are guilty, why should we be beaten?”
\p
\v 17 But the king replied, “Idlers! You are lazy! Therefore you keep saying, 'Let us go worship the LORD,' as a reason for you not to work!
\v 18 Go and get back to work! Straw will still not be provided for you, but you still have to fulfill the same number of bricks as before.”
\p
\v 19 The Israeli foremen realized that they faced a serious problem when they were told that the number of bricks they had to fulfill remained the same and was not reduced.
\v 20 After meeting with the king of Egypt, the Israeli foremen met with Moses and Aaron who were waiting for them to come out.
\v 21 They said to Moses and Aaron, “Let the LORD himself who judges and sentences you both, because you have made us even more hated by the king and his officials! You have given them a reason to finish us off!”
\p
\v 22 Moses returned and came before the LORD and said, “O my LORD, why are you adding to the burden of problems on Your people?! Why have You sent me for this?
\v 23 Since I went before the king and delivered your message, he has persecuted Your people and You have done nothing to help them!”
