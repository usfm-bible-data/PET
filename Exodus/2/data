\s Birth of Moses
\p
\v 1 At that time, a man from the tribe of Levi married a woman from the same tribe.
\v 2 The woman gave birth to a baby boy. When it was seen that the baby was pleasing\f + fr 2:2 \fk pleasing \ft What is meant by pleasing here is because his mother saw that her baby was good looking and healthy. The word 'tov' in Hebrew is often translated ‘good, good, pleasing or extraordinary'. See Gen. 1: 4; Acts 7:20; Heb 11: 23.\f*, she hid him for three months.
\v 3 When she couldn’t hide the baby any longer, she took a basket made of papyrus\f + \fr 2:3 \fk papyrus \ft Papyrus is a reed that grows in Southern Europe and North Africa, used to make household tools and also as paper material in the past.\f* bark and coated the basket with tar\f + fr 2:3 \fk tar \ft See footnote in Gen. 6: 14.\f* and plant sap so that it could float. Then she laid her child in the basket and hid it among the tall reeds on the banks of the Nile.
\v 4 The baby's older sister watched her younger brother from a distance.
\p
\v 5 Then the king’s daughter came to take a bath in the Nile River, while her female servants walked along the riverbank. When the king’s daughter saw a basket between high reeds, she told one of his servants to fetch the basket.
\v 6 When she opened it, she saw a baby crying. Her heart felt sorry for him and said, “This must be a child of the Hebrews.”
\p
\v 7 Then the baby’s older sister approached the king’s daughter and asked her, “May I look for a Hebrew woman who can breastfeed this child for the princess”
\p
\v 8 The king’s daughter replied, “Alright.” So the baby’s older sister went and called her mother.
\p
\v 9 And the king’s daughter said to the mother, “Bring and take care of this baby for me. I will pay your salary for that.” So the mother took the baby away and took care of him.
\p
\v 10 When the baby was already grown, his mother brought him back to the king’s daughter. The king’s daughter raised the child as her own child and named him Moses, saying, “I have lifted him from the water.”
\s Moses flees to Midian
\p
\v 11 One day, when Moses was an adult, he went out to visit his fellow countrymen, and saw the severity of their forced labor. And he saw an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew who was his countryman.
\v 12 Then Moses turned to the left and right, and saw that there was no one there, so he killed the Egyptian and hid his corpse in the sand.
\p
\v 13 The next day, Moses came out again and saw two Hebrews fighting. Then he asked the guilty person, “Why do you beat your fellow Hebrew?”
\p
\v 14 The man answered, “Who made you the leader or judge between us? Do you want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?”
\m Moses became afraid and thought, “Surely everyone already knows what I did.”
\v 15-16 When the king of Egypt heard what Moses had done, he intended to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the king and settled in Midian.
\p There, there was a Midian priest who had seven daughters. One day, while Moses was sitting near a well, those seven woman came to the well to draw water to give their father’s flock of sheep and goats to drink.
\v 17 Then some shepherds came to drive them away. But Moses saved them from the shepherds and helped give water to their flock of sheep and goats.
\p
\v 18 When they returned home, Reuel \f + \fr 2:18 \fk Reuel \ft had another name — Jethro. In other chapters and verses, Jethro's name is used and not Reuel which means ‘friend of God’.\f* their father, asked, “How could you come home so fast today?”
\p
\v 19 They replied, “There was an Egyptian who saved us from some shepherds who wanted to drive us away. He even fetched water and gave drink to our flock.”
\p
\v 20 Then Reuel asked his children again, “Where is that person?! Why didn’t you invite him here?! Go and invite him to eat with us.”
\p
\v 21 And Moses agreed to stay with them, and Reuel gave his daughter named Zipporah to become his wife.
\v 22 Zipporah gave birth to a son and Moses named him Gershom, because he said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign country.”
\s1 God called Moses
\p
\v 23 Time passed, and the king of Egypt died. The Israelites remained miserable and oppressed as slaves, so they called for help and their call was heard by God.
\v 24 God heard their call and remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
\v 25 God saw the suffering of the people of Israel and He paid attention to them.
