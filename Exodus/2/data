\s Birth of Moses
\p
\v 1 There was a man from the tribe of Levi who had married a woman from the same tribe.
\v 2 At the time the king of Egypt gave that command, that woman gave birth to a baby boy. When it was seen that the baby was handsome, then she hid him for three months.
\v 3 When she couldn’t hide the baby any longer, she took a basket and coated the basket with tar\f + fr 2:3 \fk tar \ft See footnote in Gen. 6: 14.\f* and plant sap so that it could float. Then she laid her child in the basket and hid it among the tall reeds on the edge of the Nile river.
\v 4 Then the baby's older sister watched over her younger sibling from a distance.
\p
\v 5 Then the king’s daughter came to take a bath in the Nile River, while her female servants walked along the riverbank. When the king’s daughter saw a basket among the tall water reeds, she ordered one of her servants to fetch the basket.
\v 6 When she opened it, she saw that the baby was crying. She felt compassion for him and said, “Surely this is a baby of the Hebrews.”
\p
\v 7 Then the baby’s older sister approached the king’s daughter and asked her, “May I look for a Hebrew woman who can nurse this child for Madam Princess”
\p
\v 8 The king’s daughter replied, “Alright.” So the girl went and called the mother of the baby.
\p
\v 9 And the king’s daughter said to the mother, “Bring this baby and take care of it for me. I will pay you for that.” So that mother took the baby away and took care of him.
\p
\v 10 When the child had stopped nursing, his mother brought him back to the king’s daughter. The king’s daughter adopted the child as her own child and named him Moses, saying, “I (intimate) lifted him from the water.”\f + \fr 2:10 \fk Moses' name \ft The sound of the name Moses in the Egyptian language sounds like the pronunciation of ‘son of’. But in Hebrew the same pronunciation sounds like the pronunciation of ‘lifted’.\f*
\s Moses flees to Midian
\p
\v 11 One day, when Moses was already an adult, he went out to visit his fellow countrymen, and saw how heavy their hard forced labor was. He saw an Egyptian who was beating an Israelite, that is one who was his own race.
\v 12 Then Moses looked to the left and right. When he saw that could be a witness, he killed the Egyptian and hid his corpse in the sand.
\p
\v 13 The next day, Moses went out again and saw two Israelites fighting. Then he asked the person in the wrong, “Why do you beat your fellow Israelite?”
\p
\v 14 The man answered, “Who made you the leader or judge between us? Do you want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian yesterday?”
\p Moses became afraid and thought, “Surely everyone already knows what I did.”
\v 15-16 When the king of Egypt heard about that murder that Moses had done, he put out the order to kill Moses. But Moses ran away and stayed in Midian.
\p There was a priest of Midian there whose name was Reuel.\f + \fr 2:16 \fk Reuel \ft In the source language text of this chapter, the name Reuel is first mentioned it verse 18. But for reasons of clarity and naturalness, TSI has moved the name of Reuel to this verse. Reuel had another name — Jethro. In other chapters and verses, Jethro's name is used and not Reuel which means ‘friend of God’.\f* He had seven daughters. One day, while Moses was sitting near a well, the seven daughters of Reuel came to the well to draw water in order to give drink to their father’s flock of sheep and goats.
\v 17 Then some shepherds came to drive them away. But Moses defended them from those shepherds, then helped give water to their flock of sheep and goats.
\p
\v 18 When they returned home, their father asked, “How did you come home so fast today?”
\p
\v 19 They replied, “There was an Egyptian who defended us from those shepherds who often drive us away. He even helped us get water and give drink to our flock.”
\p
\v 20 Then Reuel asked his children again, “Where is that person?! Why didn’t you invite him here?! Go and invite him to eat with us.”
\p
\v 21 After that event, Moses later agreed to stay with them. And Reuel gave his daughter named Zipporah to become his wife.
\v 22 Zipporah gave birth to a son and Moses named him Gershom, because he said, “I have become a new comer in a foreign country.”\f + \fr 2:22 \fk Gershom’s name \ft In Hebrew the pronunciation of the name Gershom sounds like the the word ‘foreigner’.\f*
\s1 God called Moses
\p
\v 23 Time passed, and that king of Egypt died, but under the government of a new king, the Israelites remained miserable and oppressed as slaves. They continued to cry out for help because of their slavery, and their cry was heard by God.
\v 24 God heard all their complaints and remembered His promise with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\v 25 God saw the suffering of the people of Israel and He cared about them.
