\s Birth of Moses
\p
\v 1 There was a man from the tribe of Levi who had married a woman from the same tribe.
\v 2 At the time the king of Egypt gave that command, that woman gave birth to a baby boy. When it was seen that the baby was handsome, then she hid him for three months.
\v 3 When she couldn’t hide the baby any longer, she took a basket and coated the basket with tar\f + fr 2:3 \fk tar \ft See footnote in Gen. 6: 14.\f* and plant sap so that it could float. Then she laid her child in the basket and hid it among the tall reeds on the edge of the Nile river.
\v 4 The baby's older sister watched over her younger sibling from a distance.
\p
\v 5 Then the king’s daughter came to take a bath in the Nile River, while her female servants walked along the riverbank. When the king’s daughter saw a basket among the tall water reeds, she ordered one of her servants to fetch the basket.
\v 6 When she opened it, she saw a baby who was crying. She felt compassion for him and said, “This must be a child of the Hebrews.”
\p
\v 7 Then the baby’s older sister approached the king’s daughter and asked her, “May I look for a Hebrew woman who can nurse this child for Madam Princess”
\p
\v 8 The king’s daughter replied, “Alright.” So the baby’s older sister went and called her mother.
\p
\v 9 And the king’s daughter said to the mother, “Bring this baby and take care of it for me. I will pay you for that.” So that mother took the baby away and took care of him.
\p
\v 10 When the child had stopped nursing, his mother brought him back to the king’s daughter. The king’s daughter adopted the child as her own child and named him Moses, saying, “I (intimate) lifted him from the water.”\f + \fr 2:10 \fk Moses' name \ft The sound of the name Moses in the Egyptian language sounds like the pronunciation of ‘son of’. But in Hebrew the same pronunciation sounds like the pronunciation of ‘lifted’.\f*
\s Moses flees to Midian
\p
\v 11 One day, when Moses was already an adult, he went out to visit his fellow countrymen, and saw their hard forced labor. And he saw an Egyptian who was beating an Israelite, one who was his own countryman.
\v 12 Then Moses looked to the left and right, and saw that there was no one there, so he killed the Egyptian and hid his corpse in the sand.
\p
\v 13 The next day, Moses went out again and saw two Israelites fighting. Then he asked the person in the wrong, “Why do you beat your fellow Israelite?”
\p
\v 14 The man answered, “Who made you the leader or judge between us? Do you want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?”
\p Moses became afraid and thought, “Surely everyone already knows what I did.”
\v 15-16 When the king of Egypt heard what Moses had done, he planned to kill Moses. But Moses ran away from the king and stayed in Midian.
\p There was a priest of Midian there whose name was Reuel.\f + \fr 2:16 \fk Reuel \ft In the source language text of this chapter, the name Reuel is first mentioned it verse 18. But for reasons of clarity and naturalness, TSI has moved the name of Reuel to this verse. Reuel had another name — Jethro. In other chapters and verses, Jethro's name is used and not Reuel which means ‘friend of God’.\f* He had seven daughters. One day, while Moses was sitting near a well, those seven woman came to the well and started to draw water to give drink to their father’s flock of sheep and goats.
\v 17 Then some shepherds came to drive them away, but Moses saved them from the shepherds. Then he helped give water to their flock of sheep and goats.
\p
\v 18 When they returned home, their father asked, “How did you come home so fast today?”
\p
\v 19 They replied, “There was an Egyptian who saved us from some shepherds who wanted to drive us away. He even got water and gave drink to our flock.”
\p
\v 20 Then Reuel asked his children again, “Where is that person?! Why didn’t you invite him here?! Go and invite him to eat with us.”
\p
\v 21 Because of that invitation, Moses then agreed to stay with them. And Reuel gave his daughter named Zipporah to become his wife.
\v 22 Zipporah gave birth to a son and Moses named him Gershom, because he said, “I have become a new comer in a foreign country.”\f + \fr 2:22 \fk Gershom’s name \ft In Hebrew the pronunciation of the name Gershom sounds like the the word ‘foreigner’.\f*
\s1 God called Moses
\p
\v 23 Time passed, and the king of Egypt died. But under the government of the new king, the Israelites remained miserable and oppressed as slaves, so they cried out for help and their cry was heard by God.
\v 24 God heard their cry and remembered His promise with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
\v 25 God saw the suffering of the people of Israel and He cared about them.
