\s God promises to free the people of Israel
\p
\v 1 (5:24) Then the Lord said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to the king of Egypt. I will force him to let my people go, even he will drive them out of his country. “
\p
\v 2 The Lord said to Moses, “I am the Lord.
\v 3 I who appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as the Almighty God, but I did not introduce my name, the LORD, to them.
\v 4 I also made an agreement with them. I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they used to live as immigrants.
\v 5 I have also heard the sighs of the enslaved Israelites of the Egyptians, and I remember my covenant.
\p
\v 6 Therefore tell the people of Israel, ‘I am the Lord and I will bring you out of the bondage of the Egyptians. I will punish the Egyptians with severe punishment and deliver you with My power.
\v 7 I will raise you as my people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the Lord your God, who has freed you from the slavery of the Egyptians.
\v 8 I will bring you to the land that I promised with an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I will give that country to you as your own. I am the Lord. '
\p
\v 9 Moses delivered all the messages to the Israelites, but they did not want to care because they were very desperate due to the cruel slavery.
\p
\v 10 Then the Lord said to Moses,
\v 11 “Go to the king of Egypt and tell him that he must let the Israelites go out of his land.“
\p v 12 But Moses replied, “Even the people of Israel have not heard me. How can the king of Egypt listen to someone who is not good at talking like me? “
\p
\v 13 So the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron to deliver to the Israelites and to the king of Egypt that they were assigned by the LORD to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt.
