\s The LORD promises to free the people of Israel
\p
\v 1 (5:24)\f + \fr 6:1 \fk verse numbering \ft In printed editions of the TB, this verse is found at chapter 5, verse 24. See the Preface to the TSI about verse numbering.\f* Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to the king of Egypt. I will force him to let My people go, he will even drive them out of his country.”
\p
\v 2 The LORD said to Moses, “I am the LORD.
\v 3 I am the one who revealed myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as Almighty God, but I did not make known My name, the LORD, to them.
\v 4 I also made a covenant with them. I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they used to live as immigrants.
\v 5 I have also heard the laments of the Israelites enslaved by the Egyptians, and I remember my covenant.
\p
\v 6 Because of that tell the people of Israel, ‘I am the LORD and I will bring you out of the slavery of the nation of Egypt. I will punish the Egyptian nation with severe punishment and deliver you with My power.
\v 7 I will lift you up as My people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the LORD, your God, who has delivered you from the slavery of the Egyptians.
\v 8 I will bring you to the land that I promised with an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I will give that land to you as your own possession. I am the LORD.’”
\p
\v 9 Moses delivered all the messages to the nation of Israel, but they did not want to care because they were already very desperate due to the cruel slavery.
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 11 “Go before the king of Egypt and tell him that he must let the Israelites go out of his land.”
\p \x - \xo 6:11 \xt \x*v 12 But Moses replied, “All this time the Israelites have not listened to me. How is it possible the king of Egypt will listen to someone who is not eloquent like me?”
\p
\v 13 So the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron to deliver to the nation of Israel and to the king of Egypt that they were assigned by the LORD to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt.
\s1 The line of Moses and Aaron
\p
\v 14 The following are the names of the heads of Jacob's descendants.
\li1 His eldest son was Reuben. Reuben's sons were named Henok, Palu, Hesron and Karmi. Their descendants became clans in the tribe of Reuben.
\li1
\v 15 The sons of Simeon were named Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar and Shaul (Shaul's mother was a Canaanite). They were the ancestors of the tribe of Simeon and their descendants used the same clans as their names.
\li1
\v 16 The sons of Levi in order were named Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
\li1
\v 17 The sons of Gershon were named Libni and Shimei. Their descendants became the clan of Libni and the clan of Shimei.
\li1
\v 18 The sons of Kohath were named Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kehat lived for 133 years.
\li1
\v 19 Merari's children were named Mahli and Mushi.
\b
\p So those are the clans in the tribe of Levi according to their descendants.
\li1
\v 20 Amram married his father's sister named Jochebed. They had two sons, Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
\li1
\v 21 Izhar's children were named Korah, Nepheg and Zichri.
\li1
\v 22 Uzziel's children were named Mishael, Elsaphan and Sithri.
\li1
\v 23 Aaron married Elisheba, the child of Aminadab, sister of Nahshon. He gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\li1
\v 24 Korah's children were named Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. Their descendants each became the clans of Korah.
\li1
\v 25 Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of Putiel's daughters. She gave birth to Phinehas.
\m Those are the ancestors of the families of Levi according to the clan of their descendants.
\p
\v 26 Aaron and Moses were those whom the LORD commanded to bring the people of Israel out from the land of Egypt, according to their troops. \f + \fr 6:26 \fk their troops \ft This is the first verse in which the Israelites are referred to as 'troops'. In Hebrew the word used is צְבָאוֹ (tsiv’ot)— which is a military term that illustrates God's people as a combat/war entity, and also illustrates the organized and orderly departure from Egypt.\f*
\v 27 It was they who spoke to the king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out from the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 28 The LORD said to Moses in Egypt,
\v 29 “I am the Lord! Tell the king of Egypt all of the messages that I have delivered to you. “
\p
\v 30 But Moses answered the LORD, “I am not good at speaking. How will the king possibly listen to me? “
