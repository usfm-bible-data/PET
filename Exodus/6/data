\s The LORD promises to free the people of Israel
\p
\v 1 (5:24)\f + \fr 6:1 \fk verse numbering \ft In printed editions of the TB, this verse is found at chapter 5, verse 24. See the Preface to the TSI about verse numbering.\f* Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to the king of Egypt. I will force him to let My people go, he will even drive them out of his country.”
\p
\v 2 The LORD said to Moses, “I am the LORD.
\v 3 I am the one who revealed myself to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as Almighty God, but I did not make known My name, the LORD, to them.
\v 4 I also made a covenant with them. I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they used to live as immigrants.
\v 5 I have also heard the laments of the Israelites who are enslaved by the Egyptians, and I remember My covenant.
\p
\v 6 "Because of that tell the people of Israel, ‘I am the LORD and I will bring you out of the slavery of the nation of Egypt. I will punish the Egyptian nation with severe punishment and deliver you with My power.
\v 7 I will lift you up as My people, and I will become your God. You will know that I am the LORD, your God, who has delivered you from the slavery of the Egyptians.
\v 8 I will bring you to the land that I promised by an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I will give that land to you as your own possession. I am the LORD.’”
\p
\v 9 Moses delivered all of that message to the nation of Israel, but they did not want to care about that message because they were already very desperate due to the cruel slavery.
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 11 “Go before the king of Egypt and tell him that he must let the Israelites go out of his land.”
\p
\v 12 Moses replied, “But all this time the Israelites have not listened to me, much less the king of Egypt. He will not possibly listen to me, a person who is not a good speaker?”
\p
\v 13 Regardless of that the LORD sent Moses and Aaron to the people of Israel and to the king of Egypt with the command to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt.

\v 26 Aaron and Moses were those whom the LORD commanded to bring the people of Israel out from the land of Egypt, in a big group according to their troops.\f + \fr 6:26 \fk their troops \ft This is the first verse in which the twelve tribes of Israel are referred to as 'troops'. The military term used in Hebrew pictures God's people as a combat/war entity, and also illustrates their organized and orderly departure from Egypt.\f*
\v 27 They were the ones who spoke to the king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out from the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 28 The LORD said to Moses in Egypt,
\v 29 “I am the LORD! Tell the king of Egypt all of the messages that I have delivered to you. “
\p
\v 30 But Moses answered the LORD, “I am not good at speaking. Certainly the king won't listen to me!"
