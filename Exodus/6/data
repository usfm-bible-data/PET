\s The LORD promises to free the people of Israel
\p
\v 1 (5:24)\f + \fr 6:1 \fk verse numbering \ft In printed editions of the TB, this verse is found at chapter 5, verse 24. See the Preface to the TSI about verse numbering.\f* Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to the king of Egypt. I will force him to let My people go, he will even drive them out of his country.”
\p
\v 2 The LORD said to Moses, “I am the LORD.
\v 3 I who appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as the Almighty God, but I did not introduce My name, the LORD, to them.
\v 4 I also made a covenant with them. I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they used to live as immigrants.
\v 5 I have also heard the laments of the Israelites enslaved by the Egyptians, and I remember my covenant.
\p
\v 6 Therefore tell the people of Israel, ‘I am the LORD and I will bring you out of the bondage of the Egyptians. I will punish the Egyptians with severe punishment and deliver you with My power.
\v 7 I will lift you up as My people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the LORD, your God, who has freed you from the slavery of the Egyptians.
\v 8 I will bring you to the land that I promised with an oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I will give that country to you as your own. I am the LORD.’”
\p
\v 9 Moses delivered all the messages to the Israelites, but they did not want to care because they were already very desperate due to the cruel slavery.
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 11 “Go before the king of Egypt and tell him that he must let the Israelites go out of his land.”
\p v 12 But Moses replied, “All this time even the people of Israel have not listened to me. How is it possible the king of Egypt will listen to someone who is not eloquent like me?”
\p
\v 13 So the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron to deliver to the Israelites and to the king of Egypt that they were assigned by the LORD to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt.
\s1 The line of Moses and Aaron
\p
\v 14 The following are the names of the heads of Jacob's descendants.
\li1 His eldest son was Reuben. Reuben's sons were named Henok, Palu, Hesron and Karmi. Their descendants became clans in the tribe of Reuben.
\li1
\v 15 The sons of Simeon were named Yemuel, Yamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar and Saul (Saul's mother was a Canaanite). They were the ancestors of the tribe of Simeon and their descendants used the same clans as their names.
\li1
\v 16 The sons of Levi in order were named Gerson, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
\li1
\v 17 The sons of Gerson were named Libni and Shimei. Their descendants became the clan of Libni and the clan of Shimei.
\li1 
\v 18 The sons of Kohath were named Amram, Jezhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kehat lived for 133 years.
\li1
\v 19 Merari's children were named Mahli and Musi.
\b
\p So these are the clans in the tribe of Levi according to their descendants.
\li1
\v 20 Amram married his father's sister named Yokebet. They had two sons, Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
\li1
\v 21 Yisar's children were named Korah, Nefeg and Zikri.
\li1
\v 22 Uziel's children were named Misael, Elsafan and Sitri.
\li1
\v 23 Aaron married Eliseba, the son of Aminadab, sister of Nahason. He gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Itamar.
\li1
\v 24 Korah's children were named Asir, Elkanah and Abiasaf. Their descendants each became the clans of Korah.
\li1
\v 25 Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of Putiel's daughters. He gave birth to Phinehas. 
\m These are the ancestors of the families of Levi according to the clan of their descendants.
\p
\v 26 Aaron and Moses were who the LORD commanded to bring the people of Israel out from the land of Egypt, according to their troops. \f + \fr 6:26 \fk their troops \ft This is the first verse in which the Israelites are referred to as 'troops'. In Hebrew the word used is צְבָאוֹ (tsiv’ot) - which is a military term that describes God's people as a combat/war entity, and also describes the organized and orderly departure from Egypt.\f*
\v 27 It was they who spoke to the king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out from the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 28 The LORD said to Moses in Egypt,
\v 29 “I am the Lord! Tell the king of Egypt all the messages that I have delivered to you. “
\p
\v 30 But Moses answered the LORD, “I am not good at speaking. How can the king listen to me? “
