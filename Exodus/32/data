\c 32
\s1 The golden calf
\p
\v 1 When the people saw that Moses didn't come down from the mountain, they came together to Aaron. "Come on," they said, "make us gods to lead our nation. We don't know what happened to Moses, the person who brought us out of Egypt."
\v 2 Then Aaron answered, "Take off the gold earrings from your wives and your children, and bring them to me."
\p
\v 3 So all of the people took off their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.
\v 4 Then Aaron took the gold earrings and he melted them down, shaped, and engraved them to become a gold statue shaped like a calf. Then the nation said, "Hi Israel, this is your god who brought you out of Egypt!"
\p
\v 5 When Aaron saw that the people felt happy, he raised an altar in front of that calf and said to them, "Tomorrow we will hold a celebration to the LORD!"
\p
\v 6 The next day they got up early to offer burnt sacrifices and peace sacrifices. And they ate and drank and partied.
\p
\v 7 The LORD said to Moses: "Go down quickly! The nation whom you brought out of Egypt has ruined their behavior.
\v 8 They very quickly turned from the road that I commanded. They have made a calf statue for themselves and worshiped it along with offering sacrifices to it. They said, "Hi Israel, this is your god who brought you out of Egypt!'"
\p
\v 9 Then the LORD said, " I have seen how hard headed this nation is.
\v 10 Now, allow Me to release My anger toward them and destroy them. And I will make you become one great nation."
\p
\v 11 But Moses begged the LORD his God so that He wouldn't do that thing and said, "Why release Your anger toward them? Aren't they Your people whom You brought out with Your power and Your strength?
\v 12 Don't let the Egyptians say, 'The LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt with an evil purpose, to kill them in the mountains and destroy them from the face of the earth.' Turn back Your anger. Undo Your intention and don't destroy Your people.
\v 13 Remember Your servants— Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You have sworn by Yourself and said to them, 'I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the sky. I will give this land that I've promised to your descendants and they will possess this land forever.'"
\v 14 Then the LORD reduced His intention to destroy His people.
\p
\v 15 Then Moses turned and descended the mountain while holding the two stone tablets on which were written God's laws on the front and the back.
\v 16 The two stone tablets were the work of God and He Himself wrote the laws on the two stone tablets.
\p
\v 17 The sound of crowd of people below was heard by Joshua and he shouted to Moses, "It's like there is a war in the camp!"p
\v 18 Moses answered, "No, that's not the shout of victory or the crying of defeat. I hear the sound of singing."
\v 19 When Moses approached the camp and saw the golden calf statue and the people dancing, he was very angry and he slammed the two stone tablets and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
\v 20 Moses took that golden calf that they had made, and with the help of some other people\f + \fr 32:20 \fk with the help … \ft The source text only mentions Moses as the actor for all the things done in this verse, but it is certain that he alone could not perform heavy work like this by himself.\f* he melted it in fire, pulverized it finely and threw it on top of the water. Then he ordered the Israelites to drink that water.
\p
\v 21 After that, Moses asked Aaron, "What have they done to you so that you brought them to do sin this great?
\p
\v 22 Aaron said, "Don't be angry, my lord. My lord himself knows how angry this nation is.
\v 23 They said to me, 'Make us other gods to lead our nation. We don't know what happenened to Moses, the person who brought us out of Egypt.'
\v 24 So I said to them, 'Take off your gold earrings' and they surrendered them to me. Then I threw them into the fire and it became this calf.
\p
\v 25 When Moses saw that the nation of Israel had lost cotrol and Aaron let them throw off control, so that their enemies lauged at them,
\v 26 he stood at the entrance gate of the camp and said, "Every person who is on the LORD's side, come and gather with me!" And all of the Levites came around him.
\p
\v 27 Moses said to them, "The LORD, God of Israel said: Each of you take your sword and walke from one end of the camp to the other end. Kill your brothers, your friends, and your neighbors."
\v 28 The Levites did what Moses had commanded and on that day around three thousand people were killed.
\p
\v 29 Moses said, "Today all of you have set apart yourself to serve the LORD by obeying Him, although you had to kill your children and your own brothers. Because of that the LORD will bless you all today."
\p
\v 30 The next day Moses said to the nation of Israel, "You (pl) have sinned greatly, but I will climb (up) to face the LORD and ask forgiveness for your sins."
\v 31 Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, "This nation has sinned greatly. They have made a gold god for themselves.
\v 32 But I request, forgive their sins— if not, erase my name from the list of names in your book."
\p
\v 33 But the LORD said to Moses, "I will erase the names of each person who has sinned against Me from My Book.
\v 34 Now go, lead them to the place that I've told you. My angel will travel in front of you. But the time will come when I will punish them for their sins."
\p
\v 35 Then the LORD sent a plague disease on the nation of Israel because they had ordered Aaron to make a calf statue.
