\c 24
\s The LORD binds the Covenant
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up the Mount of Sinai to come before Me— you, with Aaron and his children— namely Nadab and Abihu— along with seventy elders of Israel, then bow down to worship Me from afar.
\v 2 Only you alone may come to draw near Me, but the others must stand afar. No one may come up with you.”
\p
\v 3 Then Moses conveyed all the commands and rules that the LORD gave to that nation. All the nation with one voice said, “We will willingly do all that the LORD commands.”
\p
\v 4 Then Moses wrote all the LORD’s commands. The next day, early in the morning, Moses built an altar on the foot of the mountain and built twelve remembrance monuments, one monument for each tribe of Israel.
\v 5 He sent several young men to offer burnt sacrifice and slaughter young male oxes as a peace offering to the LORD.
\v 6 Moses poured half of the blood of the slaughtered animal into bowls, and the other half is sprinkled on the altar.
\p
\v 7 Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it with a loud voice to the whole of that nation. And they said, “We will do and obey all that the LORD commands.”
\v 8 Then Moses took the blood and sprinkle it on that nation and said, “This blood binds the covenant that the LORD make with you, based on all these commands.”
\p
\v 9 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, along with the seventy elders of Israel, went up the mountain
\v 10 and saw the God of Isarel. On His feet there is a path made of sapphire stone, clear like a blue sky without clouds.
\v 11 Even though these leaders of Israel have seen God, He don’t destroy them. They even eat and drink before Him as a symbol of binding the agreement with Him!
\s Moses on the Mount of Sinai
\p
\v 12 The LORD said to Moses, “Go up the mountain and stay there, and I will give you the tablet of stone that I wrote with the laws and commands, so that you can teach those to them.”
\v 13 Then Moses rose up with Joshua his private helper, and Moses went up to the mount of God.
\p
\v 14 He said to the elders, “Wait for us here until we come back. Aaaron and Hur are with you. If problems occur among you, you can come to them.”
\p
\v 15 Then Moses went up the mountain, and the cloud covered that mountain.
\v 16 The glory of the LORD settled over Mount Sinai, and cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day, the LORD called Moses from inside the cloud.
\v 17 From the sight of the people Israel who were at the base of the mountain, the glory of the LORD over that mountain looked like blazing fire.
\v 18 Then the LORD climbed higher over the mountain and entered into the cloud. He stayed on that mountain for forty days and forty nights.
