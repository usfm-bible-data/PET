\c 24
\s The nation of Israel receives the covenant with the LORD
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up the Mount of Sinai to come before Me— you, with Aaron and his children— namely Nadab and Abihu— along with seventy elders of Israel, then bow down to worship Me from afar.
\v 2 Only you alone may come to draw near Me, but the others may not come near. No one may come up with you.”
\p
\v 3 Then Moses conveyed all the commands and rules that the LORD gave to that nation. All the nation with one voice answered “We will willingly do all that the LORD commands.”
\p
\v 4 Then Moses wrote all the LORD’s commands. The next day, early in the morning, Moses built an altar on the foot of the mountain and built twelve remembrance stones, one stone for each tribe of Israel.
\v 5 Then he sent several young men to offer burnt sacrifice and slaughter young male oxes as a peace (animal) offering to the LORD.
\v 6 Moses poured half of the blood of the slaughtered animal into bowls, and sprinkled the other half on the altar.
\p
\v 7 Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it with a loud voice to the whole of that nation. And they answered, “We will do what the LORD has already commanded. We will obey Him.”
\v 8 Then Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the nation and said, “This blood binds the covenant that the LORD makes with you, based on all of these commands.”
\p
\v 9 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, along with the seventy elders of Israel, went up the mountain
\v 10 and saw the God of Israel. Beneath His feet there was a road made of sapphire stone, clear like a blue sky without clouds.
\v 11 Even though these leaders of Israel saw God, He didn’t destroy them. They even eat and drank before Him as a symbol of binding the promise with Him!
\s Moses on Mount Sinai
\p
\v 12 The LORD said to Moses, “Go up the mountain and stay there, and I will give you the tablets of stone that I inscribed with the laws and commands, so that you can teach those to them.”
\v 13 Then Moses left with Joshua his personal helper, and Moses went up to the top of the mountain of God.
\p
\v 14 He said to the elders, “Wait for us here until we come back. Aaron and Hur are with you. If problems occur among you, you can go to them.”
\p
\v 15 Then Moses went up the mountain, and the cloud covered that mountain.
\v 16 The glory of the LORD stayed on top of Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day, the LORD called Moses from inside the cloud.
\v 17 From the view point of the people Israel who were at the base of the mountain, the glory of the LORD on top of the mountain looked like a blazing fire.
\v 18 Then Moses climbed higher to the top of the mountain and entered into the cloud. He stayed on that mountain for forty days and forty nights.
