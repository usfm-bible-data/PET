\s1 The Passover Celebration
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,
\v 2 “From now on, this month will be the first month in your calendar year.
\v 3 Announce to all the Israelites: ‘On the tenth day of this month, each head of family must take a lamb or a young goat.
\v 4 If the number of family members is too small to eat up a lamb or young goat, they may share it with the nearest neighbor's family according to the number of family members and the amount that each person can eat.
\v 5 You must choose a one-year-old male lamb or goat and without defects.’
\p
\v 6 “Every family must care for the lamb or young goat until the fourteenth day of this month. On that day, at sunset, all the people of Israel must slaughter the lamb or the young goat.
\v 7 Then they must smear its blood on the two doorposts and on the upper door lintel of the house where the lamb or young goat will be eaten.
\v 8 On that night also, they must roast its meat on top of the fire, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
\v 9 Don't eat it raw, or boiled in water. The lamb or goat must be roasted whole on top of the fire— including the head, legs and all body organs in the belly of it.
\v 10 The meat must be consumed that night. Don't leave the meat until the next morning. Whatever is left must be burned up before morning.
\p
\v 11 “When you eat, eat quickly. You all have to wear clothes like people who are ready to travel far, wear a belt, wear footwear, and hold a staff. This is the beginning of the Passover Celebration,\f + \fr 12:11 \fk Passover \ft The name Passover comes from pes (pesakh) in the Hebrew language, which means ‘pass by’. This name reminds of how the angel of the LORD passed by the houses of the people of Israel, but entered the houses of the Egyptians in order to kill every firstborn son. For further information about the meaning of this name, see the note in the NET. \f* which will always be celebrated to honor Me, your LORD.
\v 12 That night I will go through all of Egypt and kill every firstborn son and firstborn young male of the cattle. And I will punish all the gods of Egypt— for I am the LORD.
\v 13 Blood on the door of your house will mark the house where you all are. When I see that blood, I will pass by it, and disaster will not strike you when I attack Egypt.
\p
\v 14 Every year you must remember this day and hold a celebration for the LORD from generation to generation. Do it as a statute forever.
\v 15 You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day, you must throw out all the yeast from your house. Whoever eats leavened bread during the seven days will be ostracized from Israel.
\v 16 On the 14th and 20th, that is on the first day and on the seventh day, you must have a big worship service to honor Me. On those two days you cannot do any work except to prepare food.
\p
\v 17 “You will remember the Celebration of Unleavened Bread, so that you will be reminded that on this day I will brought you out of Egypt. You must remember this day from generation to generation, as a statute forever.
\v 18 In the afternoon of the fourteenth until the evening of the twenty-first day of the first month, you must eat unleavened bread.
\v 19 During those seven days, there must not be any yeast at all in your house. If someone eats something leavened, that person must be ostracized from among you, whether a new-comer or native Israelite.
\v 20 You must not eat anything leavened. Eat unleavened bread wherever you live.”
\p
\v 21 Then Moses gathered together all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and choose lambs or young goats for each family and slaughter the Passover sacrifice.
\v 22 Take a handful of the hyssop plant,\f + \fr 12:22 \fk hyssop plant \ft This plant is a kind of small shrub that grows wild in the Sinai region whose stems and leaves can be used to sprinkle blood in Jewish religious ceremonies.\f* dip it in the blood collected in a basin and apply it to the upper lintel and two door posts of your house. No one is allowed to leave the house until the next morning.
\v 23 The LORD will go throughout the whole land in order to kill the Egyptians. And when He sees blood on the upper lintel and the two door posts of that house, the LORD will pass by it and will not let the Angel of Death enter your house and kill your firstborn children.
\p
\v 24 “You individually must obey this statute, and your children and grandchildren must remember it forever.
\v 25 After entering the land that the LORD has promised to you, you must continue to carry out this celebration.
\v 26 And when your children ask, ‘What does this ceremony mean?’
\v 27 you must answer, ‘This is the Passover offering to honor the LORD, because He passed by the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt. At that time, He killed the eldest sons of the Egyptians, but He let our families live.’”
\p After Moses said this, the people of Israel knelt and worshiped the LORD.
\v 28 Then the people of Israel did what the LORD had commanded to Moses and Aaron.
\v 29 At midnight, the LORD killed every firstborn son in all of Egypt, from the firstborn heir to the throne of the king of Egypt to the eldest son of a prisoner in prison, and also every firstborn young of cattle.
\v 30 That night the king of Egypt, with all of his officials and all the people of Egypt awoke. There were loud cries throughout all of Egypt, because someone had died in every house.
\s1 The nation of Israel leaves Egypt
\p
\v 31 That very night also, the king called Moses and Aaron to face him and said to them, “Go away from among my people— you and all of the Israelites. Go and worship the LORD as you said.
\v 32 Take your cattle, as you said, and go. Ask the LORD to bless me too!”
\v 33 The Egyptian people urged the Israelites to leave the country quickly. They said, “We will all die if you don't leave!”
\p
\v 34 So the Israelites took their bread dough which was still in the bread dough container which was not yet mixed with yeast, wrapped it in their robes, and carried it.
\v 35 According to Moses' previous instructions, the Israelites asked for gold and silver jewelry and clothing from Egyptian neighbors.
\v 36 The Lord made the people of Egypt be generous toward the Israelites, and they gave everything that was asked by the Israelites. In this way the Israelites took away the wealth of the Egyptians.
\p
\v 37 Then the people of Israel walked from Ramses to Succoth. They numbered around 600,000 adult men, not counting women and children.
\v 38 Many people who were not descendants of Israel also went along. There were also very large herds of livestock.
\v 39 They roasted bread from unleavened dough that they brought out of Egypt. The bread was unleavened because they were driven out of Egypt so urgently that they did not have time to prepare provisions.
\p
\v 40 At that time the people of Israel had lived in Egypt for 430 years.
\v 41 Exactly on the 430th day of their being in Egypt, the LORD's troops \x + \xo 12:41 \xt Ex. 6: 26 \x * left that country.
\v 42 That night was a night of watchfulness for the LORD to bring them out of Egypt. Because of that, each year on that night all the people of Israel must be watchful to honor the LORD, from generation to generation.
\s1 Rules regarding Passover celebrations
\p
\v 43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute concerning the Passover. Apart from the Israelites, foreigners may not eat Passover food.
\v 44 But slaves who have been bought with money may eat it if they have been circumcised.
\v 45 Neither new-comers nor paid workers may eat it.
\v 46 Every Passover sacrifice must be eaten in one house. You must not bring the meat out of the house, and you can't break any of its bones.
\v 47 All of the people of Israel must celebrate this.
\p
\v 48 “If there is a newcomer who lives with you and wants to celebrate the Passover to honor Me, he and all family members and male slaves with him must be circumcised. After that, he may celebrate the Passover. He will be treated the same as a native Israelite. But people who have not been circumcised may not eat the Passover food.
\v 49 The same rules apply to native Israelites and to new-comers who settle with you.”
\p
\v 50 All of the people of Israel obeyed and did what the LORD had commanded to Moses and Aaron.
\v 51 And on that day, the LORD brought all of the tribes of the Israelites out of Egypt.
