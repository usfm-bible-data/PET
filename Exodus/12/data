\s1 Easter
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,
\v 2 “From now on, this month will be the first month on your annual calendar.
\v 3 Announce to all Israelites: ‘On the tenth day of this month, each head of family must take a lamb or a young goat.
\v 4 If the number of family members is too small to eat up a lamb or young goat, they may share it with the nearest neighbor's family according to the number of family members and the amount that each person can eat.
\v 5 You must choose a one-year-old male lamb or goat and no defects.’
\p
\v 6 “Every family must care for the lamb or lamb until the fourteenth day of this month. On that day, at sunset, all Israelites must slaughter the lamb or the young goat.
\v 7 Then they must smear their blood on the two doorposts and on the upper door sill of the house where the lamb or young goat is to be eaten.
\v 8 That very night they must roast their meat on fire and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
\v 9 Don't eat it raw, or boiled in water. The lamb or goat must be roasted whole on the fire— including the head, legs and all organs in the belly of it.
\v 10 The meat must be finished that night. Don't leave the meat until the next morning. Whatever is left must be burned up before morning.
\p
\v 11 “At the meal, eat hastily. You have to wear clothes like someone who is ready to travel far, wear a belt, wear footwear, and hold a stick. This is the beginning of the Passover Festival,\f + \fr 12:11 \fk Passover \ft The name Passover comes from pes (pesakh) in Hebrew, which means ‘pass by’. This name reminds of how the angel of the Lord passed through the houses of the people of Israel, but entered the homes of the Egyptians to kill every firstborn son. For further information about the meaning of this name, see the note in the NET. \f* which will always be celebrated to honor Me, your Lord.
\v 12 That night I will explore/scour all of Egypt and kill every firstborn son and firstborn male of the cattle. And I will punish all the gods of Egypt— for I am the LORD.
\v 13 Blood on the door of your house will mark the house where you are. When I see that blood, I will pass by it, and disaster will not befall you when I attack Egypt.
\p
\v 14 Every year you must commemorate the day and hold a celebration for the LORD's from generation to generation. Do it as a established practice forever.
\v 15 You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day, you must throw out all the yeast from your home. Whoever eats leavened bread during the seven days will be excommunicated/ostracized from Israel.
\v 16 Holy meetings must be held on the first day and on the seventh day. On those two days you cannot do any work except to prepare food.
\p
\v 17 “You will commemorate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, so that you will remember that on this day I will bring you out of Egypt. You must commemorate this day from generation to generation, as a permanent established practice.
\v 18 In the afternoon of the fourteenth to the evening of the twenty-first day of the first month, you must eat unleavened bread.
\v 19 During those seven days, there must not be any yeast at all in your house. If someone eats something leavened, that person must be ostracized from among you, whether a new-comer or native Israelite.
\v 20 You must not eat anything leavened. Eat unleavened bread wherever you live.”
\p
\v 21 Then Moses gathered together all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and choose lambs or young goats for each family and slaughter the Passover sacrifice.
\v 22 Take a handful of hyssop,\f + \fr 12:22 \fk hyssop plant \ft This plant is a kind of small shrub that grows wild in the Sinai region whose stems and leaves can be used to sprinkle blood in Jewish religious ceremonies.\f* dip it in the blood held in a basin and apply it to the frame of your door. No one is allowed to leave the house until the next morning.
\v 23 The LORD will explore the whole land to kill the Egyptians. And when He sees blood on the door frame, the LORD will pass through it and will not let the Angel of Death enter your house and kill your firstborn children.
\p
\v 24 “You must obey this established practice/statute and your children and grandchildren must remember it forever.
\v 25 After entering the land that the LORD has promised you, you must continue to carry out this celebration.
\v 26 And when your children ask, ‘What does this ceremony mean?’
\v 27 you must answer, ‘This is the Passover offering to honor the LORD, because He has passed by the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt. At that time, He killed the eldest sons of the Egyptians, but He let our families live.’”
\p After Moses said this, the people of Israel knelt and worshiped the LORD.
\v 28 Then the people of Israel did what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
\v 29 At midnight, the LORD killed every firstborn son in all of Egypt, from the firstborn heir to the throne of the king of Egypt to the eldest son of a prisoner in prison, and also every firstborn of cattle.
\v 30 That night the king of Egypt, with all his officials and all the people of Egypt awoke. There were loud cries throughout Egypt, because someone had died in every house.
\s1 The Israelites left Egypt
\p
\v 31 That very night, the king called Moses and Aaron to face him and said to them, “Go away from among my people— you and all of Israelite people. Go and worship the LORD as you said.
\v 32 Take your cattle, as you said, and go. Ask the LORD	 to bless me too!”
\v 33 Egyptians urged the Israelite people to leave the country quickly. They said, “We will all die if you don't leave!”
\p
\v 34 So the Israelites carried their bread dough which was still in the bread dough container which was not yet mixed with yeast, wrapped it in their robes, and carried it.
\v 35 As per Moses' previous instructions, the Israelites asked for gold and silver jewelry and clothing from Egyptian neighbors.
\v 36 The Lord made the people of Egypt be generous towards the Israelites, and they gave everything that was asked by the Israelites. In this way the Israelites took away the wealth of the Egyptians.
\p
\v 37 The people of Israel walked from Ramses to Succoth. They numbered around 600,000 adult men, not counting women and children.
\v 38 Many people who were not descendants of Israel also went along. There were also very large herds.
\v 39 They roasted bread from unleavened dough that they brought out of Egypt. The bread was unleavened because they were driven out of Egypt so urgently that they did not have time to prepare provisions.
\p
\v 40 At that time the people of Israel had lived in Egypt for 430 years.
\v 41 Exactly on the 430th day of their being in Egypt, the LORD's troops \x + \xo 12:41 \xt Ex. 6: 26 \x * left that country.
\v 42 That night was a night of watchfulness for the LORD to bring them out of Egypt. Because of that, each year on that night all the people of Israel must be watchful to honor the LORD, from generation to generation.
\s1 Rules regarding Passover celebrations
\p
\v 43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, “This is the decree concerning the Passover. Apart from the people of Israel, foreigners must not eat Passover food.
\v 44 But slaves who have been bought with money may eat it if they have been circumcised.
\v 45 Neither new-comers nor wage workers may eat it.
\v 46 Every Passover sacrifice must be eaten in one house. You must not bring the meat out of the house, and you can't break any bone of it.
\v 47 All Israelites must celebrate this.
\p
\v 48 “If there is a newcomer who lives with you and wants to celebrate the Passover to honor the Lord, he and all family members and male slaves with him must be circumcised. After that, he may celebrate the Passover. He will be treated the same as the native Israelites. But people who have not been circumcised should not eat the Passover meal.
\v 49 The same rules apply to native Israelis and new-comers who settle with you.”
\p
\v 50 All the people of Israel obeyed and did what the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.
\v 51 And on that day, the LORD brought all the tribes of the people of Israel out of Egypt.
