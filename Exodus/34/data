\c 34
\s1 The two new stone tablets
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Cut two new stone tablets like the two stone tablets that you broke. I will write on the stone tablets the same words as the stone tablets before them— which you broke.
\v 2 Tomorrow morning you have to be ready to climb Mount Sinai. Stand before Me on the top of that mountain.
\v 3 Not one person may follow to the top with you or be anywhere on that mountain. Even flocks of sheep and cows can't eat grass near that mountain."
\p
\v 4 So Moses cut two stone tablets as before. And the next day— early in the morning— he took the two stone tablets in his hands and climbed Mount Sinai, just as the LORD ordered.
\v 5 Then the LORD came down in a cloud and stood beside Moses, and He revealed His name— that is Yahweh.
\v 6 The the LORD passed in front of Moses and said,
\q1 "I am Yahweh,
\q1 merciful God and kindhearted, long patient,
\q2 and always overflow love and faithfulness.
\q1
\v 7 I continue to overflow My faithful love to thousands of descendants,
\q2 by forgiving their wrongs, transgressions and sins.
\q1 But I won't release people who are wrong from their punishment.
\q1 I will punish their children and their grandchildren,
\q2 even to the third and fourth generation, because of their wrongs."
\p
\v 8 At that time also Moses knelt and worshiped the LORD.
\v 9 Then Moses said, "Yes LORD, if You are truly happy with me, I request to walk together with us. Even though we are a nation that is hard headed and don't obey, but forgive our wrongs and sins. Make us Your own possession."
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD answered, "Pay attention, now I make a promise with you. I will do miracles that have never been done in all the earth by any nation at all. Everyone around you will see how awesome is My power when they see My deeds to you.
\v 11 Obey my orders that I give you today, and I will chase away the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
\p
\v 12 "Be careful, don't make promises with the residents of the land that you will be entering. If you do that, you will be caught in their evil way of life.
\v 13 On the other hand, tear down their altars, destroy their idol statues, and cut down their worship poles to the goddess Ashera.
\v 14 You all may not worship false gods, for I, the LORD, am a jealous God.
\p
\v 15 "Don't make promises with the residents of that land. They prostitute themselves by worshiping and offering sacrifices to their god. If you befriend them, then they will invite you to take part with them and you will follow eating their sacrificial offerings.
\v 16 Then you all will take their women as wives for your sons. And when their daughters prostitute themselves by worshiping false gods, they will make your sons do the same thing.
\v 17 Don't make idols for you to worship.
\p
\v 18 "Remember the celebration day of Unleavened Bread. Every year at the time that I've appointed and ordered, you all have to eat bread without yeast for seven days. This celebration is to be done in the month Abib, to remember that in that month you all went out from Egypt.
\p
\v 19 "All of your sons that were born first are My possessions. The same with all male livestock that is born first— both cattle and sheep.
\v 20 But you may take back the first born male donkey, by offering to Me a lamb as its redemption. If you don't redeem it, you have to kill that donkey by breaking its neck. The same with every first born son: You have to redeem them.
\p "No one may come before Me without offering a sacrifice.
\p
\v 21 Six days long you work, but on the seventh day you have to rest— even though at the time of plowing and the time of reaping.
\p
\v 22 "Remember the Holiday of Seven Weeks to celebrate the first produce of the wheat harvest, and the Holiday of Gathering at the end of the year.
\v 23 Three times in every year every male has to come before Me, who is the Lord and God of Israel.
\v 24 I will chase away the other nations before you all and broaden the boundaries of your district, and there is no one who will be brave to seize your land when you all face me the LORD, at those three celebrations.
\p
\v 25 Don't offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread. And don't let the leftover slaughtered sacrifice of the celebration of Passover remain until the next day.
\p
\v 26 “Bring the best of your first harvest to the house of the LORD your God.
\p “Don't cook a young goat in its mother's milk.”
\p
\v 27 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write all of this, because based on these words I make a promise with you and with the nation of Israel."
\p
\v 28 Moses was on top of the mountain with the LORD forty days and forty nights, and as long as that he didn't eat or drink. And the LORD\f + \fr 34:28 \fk LORD \ft Literally, 'he'. As in the NLT, the TSI translation team thinks that the writer meant the LORD, not Moses himself. Compare to Ex. 34:1; Deut. 10:2-4.\f* wrote the words of the covenant— that is the ten commandments of God—on the two stone tablets.
\p
\v 29 When Moses descended from Mount Sinai with the two stone tablets that were written the LORD's laws, he didn't know that his face shown because the LORD spoke with him.
\v 30 When Aaron and the people of Israel saw Moses face that shown, they were afraid to approach him.
\v 31 However Moses called them and requested Aaron and all of the leaders of the nation of Israel to come and he spoke to them.
\v 32 Then all of the people of Israel approached Moses, and he delivered to them all of the orders that the LORD gave to him on Mount Sinai.
\v 33 After Moses finished speaking to them, he covered his face with a cloth.
\v 34 Every time Moses came to the Meetng Tent to speak with the LORD, he took off that cloth from his face until he went out. Then when he went out he delivered to the nation of Israel the things that the LORD had delivered to him.
\v 35 At that time the Israelites could see that his face shown. After that Moses always covered his face again until he entered again to speak to the LORD.
