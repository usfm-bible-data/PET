\c 26
\s1 The Lord’s Tent
\s2 Roof
\p
\v 1 "Make the roof of God’s Tent, the lowest layer, from ten sheets of fine linen cloth that have been embroidered with pictures of winged creatures using blue, purple and red colored wool thread.
\v 2 The measurement of each sheet of cloth has to be the same— which is 13 meters long and 1,8 meters wide.
\v 3 Join five sheets on their long side to become one set, and the other five sheets to become one set.
\v 4-5 Make fifty clasp holes from blue yarn on the long side edge of the last cloth on one set. Every clasp hole on that set of cloths must be opposite a clasp hole on the long side of the last cloth in the second set.
\v 6 Then make fifty clasps from gold to connect each clasp hole on the two chained cloths, so that the My tent becomes one unit.
\v 7-8 For the second layer for the roof of My tent, make eleven sheets of fabric from goat's hair. Each sheet has to have the same measurement, which is 14 meters long and 1,8 meters wide.
\v 9 Unite five sheets of cloth to become one set/chain, and six sheets of other cloth to become one set. The sixth sheet of the cloth has to be folded double on top of the front part of the tent.
\v 10-11 Make fifty clasp holes along the long side of the last cloth of the two sets of cloth and make fifty clasps from bronze. Then insert one clasps into the opposite clasp hole to connect the two sets of cloth.
\v 12 This covering cloth is one meter longer than the linen covering cloth. Let this excess part add to the part of cloth that hangs to cover the back side of the tent.
\v 13 This covering cloth is also wider by half a meter than the linen covering fabric on the right and left sides. Let this excess part hang to cover both sides of the My tent.
\v 14 On top of the fabric coverings, put on a covering which is made of rams skins that are dyed/colored red. And on top of that again put on a covering leather that does not absorb water.
\s2 Frames for the roof
\p
\v 15 “As a place to attach the cloths for the roof of My tent, make frames that are of acacia wood.
\v 16 Each frame's height will be 4 meters and width is 66 centimeters.
\v 17 Make two tenons beneath each frame so that the frames can be connected to other frames.
\v 18 Make twenty frames for the south side of the tent,
\v 19 and for the bottom part make forty bases from silver, two bases for each frame. Connect the two bolts on the bottom of each frame on the two bases.
\v 20 And make twenty frames for the north side of the tent,
\v 21 and also forty silver bases, two bases for each frame.
\v 22 Make six frames for the back side of the tent, on the west side.
\v 23 Make also two frames for the two back corners of the tent.
\v 24 The two corner frames have to be connected at the back corner, from the bottom part to the connecting gold ring at the top.
\v 25 In total there are eight frames for the back side of the Holy Tent, set on sixteen silver bases, two bases for each frame.
\v 26 “Then make cross bars from acacia wood and attach them across the frames, five bars for the north side of the My tent,
\v 27 five bars for the south side, and five for the back part of the tent that faces the west.
\v 28 The middle cross bar is attached on half the height of the frames and cross from one end to another end.
\v 29 Cover the frames with gold and make gold bracelets as places to insert the cross bars. Also cover the cross bars with gold.
\p
\v 30 Erect My tent according to the plan that I showed you on top of the mountain.
\s2 The two rooms inside the LORD’s Tent
\p
\v 31 “For the inside of My tent, make a special curtain from fine linen cloth that is spun with pictures of winged creatures that are embroidered with blue, purple, and red colored wool thread.
\v 32 Hang that curtain with gold clasps from four acacia wood posts that are covered with gold.
\v 33 Place the Chest of Promise behind the curtain. The room in front of the curtain is the Holy Room, while the room behind the curtain is the Most Holy Room.
\p
\v 34 "Then place the chest's cover on top of the Chest of Promise in the Most Holy Room.
\v 35 On the outside of the curtain, put the table on the north side and the branched lampstand on the southside, facing each other.
\p
\v 36 “Make also a curtain for the tent entrance door from fine linen cloth that is embroidered with blue, purple and red wool thread.
\v 37 Hang that curtain with gold clasps from five acacia wood posts that are covered with gold. Those posts will be placed on five bases of bronze."
