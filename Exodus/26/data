\c 26
\s1 The Lord’s Tent
\s2 Roof
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “This is how to make the roof of My Tent. The lowest layer, from ten sheets of fine linen cloth that have been embroidered with pictures of winged creatures using blue, purple, and red colored wool thread.
\v 2 The measurement of each sheet of cloth has to be the same, which is 13 meters long and 180 centimeters wide.
\v 3 Make two sets from the ten sheets of cloth. Five sheets will be joined on their long side to become one set, and the other five sheets to become one set.
\v 4-5 Along the the length of the extreme end of the two sets, make fifty clasp holes from blue yarn. Every clasp hole on that set of cloths must be opposite a clasp hole on the long side of the last cloth in the second set.
\v 6 To join every clasp hole on that set of sheets of cloth make fifty clasps from gold. The two sets of cloth will be joined with the gold clasps so that the roof of My tent becomes one unit.
\v 7-8 For the second layer for the roof of My tent, make eleven sheets of fabric from goat's hair. Each sheet has to have the same measurement, which is 14 meters long and 1,8 meters wide.
\v 9 From the eleven sheets of cloth make two sets. Unite five sheets of cloth to become one set/chain, and six sheets of other cloth to become one set. The sixth sheet of the cloth will be folded double on top of the front part of the tent.
\v 10-11 Make fifty clasp holes along the long side of the last cloth of the two sets of cloth, and prepare fifty clasps from bronze. Every pair of clasp holes will be joined with a clasp so that the eleven sheets become two sets/chains.
\v 12 This covering cloth is one meter longer than the linen covering cloth. Let this excess part add to the part of cloth that hangs to cover the back side of the tent.
\v 13 This covering cloth is also wider by half a meter than the linen covering fabric on the right and left sides. Let this excess part hang to cover both sides of the My tent.
\v 14 On top of the fabric coverings, put on a covering which is made of rams skins that are dyed/colored red. And on top of that again put on a covering leather that does not absorb water.
\s2 Frames for the roof
\p
\v 15 “As a place to attach the cloths for the roof of My tent, make frames that are of acacia wood.
\v 16 Each frame's height will be 4 meters and width is 66 centimeters.
\v 17-22 All of these frames will be made in the same way, with two pegs that extend from below at the left and right ends of each frame. Make twenty frames for the south side of the tent, twenty frames for the north side of the tent, and eight for the back side. As a place to hold those frames, every peg will be put in a hole in a heavy base that will be made of silver. In total there will be ninty-six bases for the forty-eight frames.
\v 23-25 At the back of the tent, six frames will be made in the same way as the frames on the two sides. But the two frames for the back corners will be made in a special way. Those two will unite the back corners from the bottom to the top, where there will be a gold holding ring. The eight frames at the back will be joined to sixteen bases made from silver, two for every frame.
\v 26 “To make My tent sturdy, make cross bars from acacia wood, which will be used to join across and unify the frames. Five bars will go across the north side of the tent,
\v 27 five bars for the south side, and five shorter ones will go across the back part of the tent, which is on the west.
\v 28 Four of the cross bars will be attached above and below, while the middle cross bar is attached at half the height of the frames, and cross from one end to another end.
\v 29 Make bracelets ofegold as a place to insert the cross bars. All the frames and cross bars will be covered with gold.
\p
\v 30 Erect My tent according to the plan that I showed you on top of the mountain.”
\s2 The two rooms inside the LORD’s Tent
\p
\v 31 “To separate the interior of My tent to become two rooms, make a special curtain from fine linen cloth that is embroidered with pictures of winged creatures that are embroidered with blue, purple, and red colored wool thread.
\v 32 Hang that curtain with gold clasps from four acacia wood posts that are covered with gold.
\v 33-34 The Chest of Promise, complete with its cover, will be placed in the room behind the curtain, which will be called the Most Holy Room. While the room in front of the curtain will be called the Holy Room. Then place the chest's cover on top of the Chest of Promise in the Most Holy Room.
\v 35 On the outside of the curtain, put the table on the north side and the branched lampstand on the southside, facing each other.
\p
\v 36 “Make also a curtain for the tent entrance door from fine linen cloth that is embroidered with blue, purple and red wool thread.
\v 37 Hang that curtain with gold clasps from five acacia wood posts that are covered with gold. Those posts will be placed on five bases of bronze."
