\s1 The Holy Tent
\p
\v 1 "Make the Holy Tent from ten sheets of fine linen cloth that have been embroidered with pictures of winged creatures using blue, purple and red colored wool thread.
\v 2 The measurement of each sheet of cloth has to be the same— which is 13 meters long and 1,8 meters wide.
\v 3 Join five sheets on their long side to become one set, and the other five sheets to become one set.
\v 4-5 Make clasp holes from blue yarn on the long side edges of the last cloth on each set of cloth, each as many as fifty hook holes. Every hook holes on one set of cloth must be face to face with the hook holes on the other set of cloth.
\v 6 Then make fifty hooks from gold to connect each hook hole on the two chained cloths, so that the Holy Tent becomes one unit.
\v 7-8 Make eleven sheets of fabric from goat's hair to cover the Holy Tent. Each sheet has to have the same measurement, which is the length of 14 meters and width 1,8 meters.
\v 9 Unite five sheets of cloth to become one set/chain, and six sheets of other cloth to become one set. The sixth sheet of the cloth has to be folded double on top of the front part of the Holy Tent.
\v 10-11 Make fifty hook holes along the long side of the last cloth of the two sets of cloth and make fifty hooks from bronze. Then insert the hooks into each of the hook holes of the two sets of cloth to connect the two sets of cloth.
\v 12 This covering cloth is one meter longer than the linen covering cloth. Let this excess part add to the part of cloth that hangs to cover the back side of the Holy Tent.
\v 13 This covering cloth is also wider by half a meter than the linen covering fabric on the right and left sides. Let this excess part hang to cover both sides of the Holy Tent.
\v 14 On top of that covering fabric pieces, put on a covering of rams skins that is dyed/colored red, and on top of that again put on a covering leather that does not absorb water.
\p
\v 15 "Make frames that are perpendicular of acacia wood for the Holy Tent.
\v 16 Each frame's height is 4 meters and width is 66 centimeters.
\v 17 Make two tenons beneath each frame so that the frames can be connected to other frames.
\v 18 Make twenty frames for the south side of the Holy Tent,
\v 19 and for the bottom part make forty bases from silver, two bases for each frame. Connect the two bolts on the bottom of each frame on the two bases.
\v 20 And make twenty frames for the north side of the Holy Tent,
\v 21 and also forty silver bases, two bases for each frame.
\v 22 Make six frames for the back side of the Holy Tent, on the west side.
\v 23 Make also two frames for the two back corners of the Holy Tent.
\v 24 The two corner frames have to be connected from the bottom part to the top. Gold bracelets have to be connected to each corner frame to support the cross bars.
\v 25 In total there are eight frames for the back side of the Holy Tent, set on sixteen silver bases—two bases for each frame.
\v 26 "Then make cross bars from acacia wood and attach them across the frames, five bars for the north side of the Holy Tent,
\v 27 five bars for the south side, and five for the back part of the Holy Tent that faces the west.
\v 28 The middle cross bar is attached on half the height of the frames and cross from one end to another end.
\v 29 Cover the frames with gold and make gold bracelets as places to insert the cross bars. Also cover the cross bars with gold.
\p
\v 30 Erect the Holy Tent according to the plan that I showed you on top of the mountain.
\p
\v 31 “For the inside of the Holy Tent, make a special curtain from fine linen cloth that is spun with pictures of winged creatures that are embroidered with blue, purple, and red colored wool thread.
\v 32 Hang that curtain with gold hooks from four acacia wood posts that are covered with gold.
\v 33 Place the Chest of Promise behind the curtain. The room in front of the curtain is the Holy Room, while the room behind the curtain is the Most Holy Room.
\p
\v 34 "Then place the chest's cover on top of the Chest of Promise in the Most Holy Room.
\v 35 On the outside of the curtain, put the table on the north side and the branched lampstand on the southside, facing each other.
\p
\v 36 "Make also a curtain for the tent entrance door from fine linen cloth that is embroidered with blue, purple and red wool thread.
\v 37 Hang that curtain with gold hooks from five acacia wood posts that are covered with gold. Those posts will be placed on five bases of bronze."
