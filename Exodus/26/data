\v 2 The measurement of each sheet of cloth has to be the same— which is 13 meters long and 2 meters wide.\f + \fr 26:2 \fk measurement \ft Literally, '28 hastas by 4 hastas'.\f*
\v 3 Join five sheets to become one set, and the other five sheets to become one set.
\v 4-5 Make hook holes from blue yarn along the the outer side of the last cloth on each set of cloth, each as many as fifty hook holes. Every hook holes on one set of cloth must be face to face with the hook holes on the other set of cloth.
\v 6 Then make fifty hooks from gold to connect each hook hole on the two chained cloths, so that the Holy Tent becomes one unit.
\v 7-8 Make eleven curtain sheets from goat's skin to cover the Holy Tent. Each sheet has to have the same measurement, which is the length of 14 meters and width 2 meters.\f + \fr 26:7 \fk measurement Literally, ‘30 hastas by 4 hastas\ft ’.\f*
\v 9 Unite five sheets of cloth to become one chain, and six sheets of other cloth to become one chain. The sixth sheet of the cloth has to be folded double in front of the Holy Tent.
\v 10-11 Make fifty hook holes on the length of the out side of two chains of cloth, and hook each of the hook holes of the two chains of cloth with bronze hooks so that they become one unit.
\v 12 Half of the extra cloth cover will be allowed to dangle in the back part of the Holy Tent.
\v 13 And the extra part of cloth which is more than its covering cloth will dangle as long as 45 centimeters on each side of the tent in order to cover it.
\v 14 On top of that covering cloth, connect a covering cloth of rams skins that have been dyed/colored red, and on top of that attach a covering cloth of fine leather.
\p
\v 15 "Make the Holy Tent's frame that is perpendicular of acacia wood.
\v 16 Each frame's height is 4 meters and width is 66 centimeters.
\v 17 Make two tenons beneath each frame so that the frames can be connected to other frames. Make each frame like that.
\v 18 Make twenty frames on the south side of the Holy Tent,
\v 19 and for the bottom part make forty bases from silver, two bases for each frame. Connect the two bolts on the bottom of each frame with the two bases.
\v 20 And make twenty frames for the north side of the Holy Tent,
\v 21 and also forty silver bases, two bases for each frame.
\v 22 For the back part of the Holy Tent, the west side, make six frames.
\v 23 Make also two frames for the corner parts of the back of the Holy Tent.
\v 24 The two corner frames have to be connected from the bottom part to the top. Gold bracelets have to be connected to each corner frame to support the cross bars.
\v 25 All of it will be eight frames for the part of the two corners of the back of the Holy Tent, supported by sixteen silver bases—two bases for each frame.
\v 26 "Then make cross bars from acacia wood and attach them across the frames, five for the north side of the Holy Tent,
\v 27 and five for the south side, and also five for the back part of the Holy Tent that faces the western part.
\v 28 The middle cross bar is attached to the middle part of the frames and cross from one end to another end.
\v 29 Cover the frames with gold and make gold bracelets as places to insert the cross bars. Cover the cross bars with gold too.

\v 32 Hang that curtain with gold hooks from four acacia wood posts that are covered with gold.
\v 33 Place the Chest of Promise behind theat curtain that has been connected. That curtain will divide the Holy Room from the Most Holy Room.
\p
\v 34 "Then place the chest's cover on top of the Chest of Promise in the Most Holy Room.
