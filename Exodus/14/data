\c 14
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 “Order the Israelites to return and camp by the edge of the sea at Pi Hahiroth, which is located between the city of Migdol and the Red Sea, and facing Baal Zephon.
\v 3 Then the king of Egypt will say, ‘The people of Israel are lost and trapped in the wilderness.’
\v 4 And I will harden the king's heart so that he chases after them. In that way I will be glorified when I defeat the king of Egypt and his entire army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” So the people of Israel camped there according to the Lord's command.
\s1 The Egyptian troops chase the people of Israel
\p
\v 5 When the Egyptian king was told that the people of Israel had run away, the king and his officials changed their minds and said, “Why did we let the people of Israel go? Now we've lost our slaves!”
\v 6 Then he ordered so that his war chariot was prepared for him, and the soldiers who would go with him.
\v 7 He took 600 choice chariots of war along with all of the other war chariots that were in Egypt. Each chariot was driven by an officer.
\v 8 The Lord hardened the heart of the king of Egypt so that he chased the people of Israel, who had gone out very bravely and victoriously.
\v 9 The Egyptian army— including all of its horse troops, chariots and their drivers— chased the Israelites and they succeeded in following the people of Israel, and they succeeded in following to camp of the people of Israel by the edge of the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
\p
\v 10 When the people of Israel saw the king of Egypt and his troops approaching, they were very frightened and cried out for help from the LORD.
\p
\v 11 They said to Moses, “Are there no graves in Egypt, so you brought us to die in this wilderness? Why did you bring us out of Egypt?
\v 12 Didn't we previously say to you in Egypt, ‘Don't interfere! Let us remain slaves for the Egyptians. It's better to be an Egyptian slave than to die in the wilderness!’”
\p
\v 13 But Moses answered them, "Don't be afraid! Stand firm and see what the LORD will do today to save us! We will never again see these Egyptian troops that we face today.
\v 14 The Lord will fight for us, and we don't need to do a thing.”
\s1 Crossing the Red Sea
\p
\v 15 The LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out for My help? Order the Israelites to go forward!
\v 16 Raise your rod and direct it over the sea. The sea will divide so that the people of Israel can walk across it on dry ground.
\v 17 And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they chase the people of Israel into the middle of the sea, and I will be glorified over the king of Egypt and all his troops, including his horse troops, chariots, and their drivers.
\v 18 The Egyptians will see that I am the LORD when I defeat them."
\p
\v 19 Then the angel who had previously traveled in front of the group of the people of Israel, moved to the rear. In that way also the cloud pillar moved from the front to the back,
\v 20 to come between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of the people of Israel. As day became night, the pillar of cloud changed to become a pillar of fire that lit up the night.\f + \fr 14:20 \fk lit up the night \ft The source text for this verse has already been exegeted. There is an exegesis from the tradition of the Israelites that says that on the side of the people of Israel, the pillar of fire gave light, whereas the side of the troops of Egypt experienced darkness. But the source text can't be understood to explain that.\f* In that way the Egyptians could not approach the Israelites all night.
\p
\v 21 Then Moses directed his hand over the sea, and the LORD made the east wind blow very hard all night so that the sea water was divided in half and the foundation of the sea became dry.
\v 22 The people of Israel walked on dry ground across the sea, while their left and right sides were fenced in by a wall of water.
\v 23 All of the troops of the king of Egypt, including all of the horse troops, the chariots, and their drivers, chased the people of Israel to the middle of the sea.
\v 24 Just before morning, the LORD, who was in the pillar of fire and cloud, looked down at the Egyptian troops and confused them.
\v 25 He made the wheels of the Egyptian army's chariots jam, so that they had difficulty advancing. They said, "Let's run from here! The Lord is fighting for the people of Israel against us!"
\p
\v 26 The LORD said to Moses, "Direct your staff over the sea, so that the waters of the sea return to cover all of the Egyptian troops."
\v 27 So at the time of dawn after the people of Israel crossed, Moses directed his staff over the sea, and at the time just before morning, the sea waters became one as before. The Egyptian troops tried to run away, but the LORD drowned them in the middle of the sea.
\v 28 The sea waters returned to become one and covered the horse troops and the chariot drivers, in fact all of the kings troops who chased the people of Israel into the middle of the sea. There was not even one person who was saved.
\p
\v 29 In that way the people of Israel had crossed the sea on dry ground, and were fenced in with a wall of water on their left and right sides.
\v 30 On that day the LORD saved the people of Israel from the Egyptian troops, and the people of Israel watched the Egyptian troops be washed up on the beach.
\v 31 When the people of Israel saw how great the LORD's power was toward the Egyptian troops, they became respectful and afraid of the LORD and they believed in Him and also in Moses, His servant.
