\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 “Order the Israelites to return and camp by the sea at Pi Hahirot, which is located between the city of Migdol and the Red Sea, and facing Baal Zephon.
\v 3 Then the king of Egypt will say, ‘The Israelites are lost and trapped in the wilderness.’
\v 4 And I will harden the king's heart so that he chases after them. Thus I will be glorified over the king of Egypt and his entire army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” So the Israelites camped there according to the Lord's command.
\s1 The Egyptian troops chase the people of Israel
\p
\v 5 When the Egyptian king was told that the Israelites had fled, the king and his officials changed their minds and said, “Why did we let the Israelites get away from our slavery here?”
\v 6 Then the king had [his war//a] chariot prepared for him and took army divisions with him.
\v 7 He took 600 chariots of choice along with all the other chariots in Egypt. Each chariot was driven by an officer.
\v 8 The Lord hardened the heart of the king of Egypt so he pursued the Israelites, who had gone out very brave and victoriously.
\v 9 The Egyptian Army with all its horses, chariots and their drivers chased the Israelites and they caught up with the Israelites at their camp by the sea near Pi Hahirot, opposite Baal Zevon.
\p
\v 10 When the Israelites saw the king of Egypt and his army approaching, they were very frightened and cried out for help from the LORD.
\p
\v 11 They said to Moses, “Are there no graves in Egypt, so you brought us to die in this place? Why did you bring us out of Egypt?
\v 12 Didn't we once say to you in Egypt, ‘Don't interfere! Let us remain slaves to the Egyptians. It's better to be an Egyptian slave than to die in the wilderness!’”
\p
\v 13 But Moses answered them, "Don't be afraid! Stand firm and see what the LORD will do today to save us! We will never again see these Egyptians we see today.
\v 14 The Lord will fight for us, and we don't need to do anything.”
\s1 The Crossing of the Red Sea
\p
\v 15 The LORD said to Moses, "Why do you cry out for my help? Tell the Israelites to go forward!
\v 16 Raise your rod and [?point it over] the sea. Divide the sea so that the Israelites can walk across it on dry land.
\v 17 And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they chase the Israelites into the middle of the sea, and I will be glorified over the king of Egypt and all his armies, his chariots, and his armies.
\v 18 The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I defeat them. "
\p
\v 19 Then the Angel of God who had previously walked before a group of Israelites moved back. Likewise the cloud pillar moved from front to back,
\v 20 between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of the Israelites. At night, the cloud brought darkness to the Egyptians, but lit up the Israelites. Thus, the Egyptians could not approach the Israelites all night.
\p
\v 21 Then Moses [?set] his hand over the sea, and the LORD made the east wind blow so hard all night that the sea water was split in half and the bottom of the sea became dry.
\v 22 The Israelites walked on dry ground across the sea, while their left and right sides were enclosed by a wall of water.
\v 23 The Egyptians, all the horses and the king's cavalry and chariot, chased the Israelites into the middle of the sea.
\v 24 Towards morning, the LORD, who was in the pillar of fire and cloud, looked down at the Egyptian troops and confused them.
\v 25 He made the wheels of the Egyptian army train jammed, so they had difficulty advancing. The Egyptians said, "Let's run from here! The Lord is fighting for the Israelites against us. "
\p
\v 26 The LORD said to Moses, "Put your hand upon the sea, so that the waters of the sea will again cover the Egyptians, the chariot troops and their pilgrims."
\v 27 So Moses set his hands upon the sea and at the time of morning, the sea was reunited as before. The Egyptians tried to escape, but the LORD drowned them in the middle of the sea.
\v 28 The seawater reunited and covered the Egyptian king's chariots, horsemen and all the Egyptian soldiers who chased the Israelites into the middle of the sea, no one survived.
\p
\v 29 But the Israelites crossed the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on their left and right sides.
\v 30 On that day the LORD saved the Israelites from the Egyptians, and the Israelites watched the Egyptians die and were stranded on the beach.
\v 31 When the Israelites saw how great the Lord's power was over the Egyptians, they became respectful and afraid of the LORD and they believed
