\c 14
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 “Order the Israelites to return and camp by the edge of the sea at Pi Hahiroth, which is located between the city of Migdol and the Red Sea, and facing Baal Zephon.
\v 3 Then the king of Egypt will say, ‘The Israelites are lost and trapped in the wilderness.’
\v 4 And I will harden the king's heart so that he chases after them. Thus I will be glorified over the king of Egypt and his entire army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.” So the Israelites camped there according to the Lord's command.
\s1 The Egyptian troops chase the people of Israel
\p
\v 5 When the Egyptian king was told that the Israelites had fled, the king and his officials changed their minds and said, “Why did we let the Israelites go? Now we've lost our slaves!”
\v 6 Then he ordered so that his war chariot was prepared for him, and also the soldiers who would go with him.
\v 7 He took 600 war choice chariots along with all of the other war chariots in Egypt. Each chariot was driven by an officer.
\v 8 The Lord hardened the heart of the king of Egypt so that he chased the Israelites, who had gone out very bravely and victoriously.
\v 9 The Egyptian army with all of its horses, chariots and their drivers chased the Israelites and they succeeded in following the Israelites to their camp by the edge of the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
\p
\v 10 When the Israelites saw the king of Egypt and his troops approaching, they were very frightened and cried out for help from the LORD.
\p
\v 11 They said to Moses, “Are there no graves in Egypt, so you brought us to die in this place? Why did you bring us out of Egypt?
\v 12 Didn't we previously say to you in Egypt, ‘Don't interfere! Let us remain slaves for the Egyptians. It's better to be an Egyptian slave than to die in the wilderness!’”
\p
\v 13 But Moses answered them, "Don't be afraid! Stand firmly and see what the LORD will do today to save us! We will never again see these Egyptians that we see today.
\v 14 The Lord will fight for us, and we don't need to do anything.”
\s1 Crossing the Red Sea
\p
\v 15 The LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out for My help? Order the Israelites to go forward!
\v 16 Raise your rod and direct it over the sea. The sea will divide so that the Israelites can walk across it on dry land.
\v 17 And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they chase the Israelites into the middle of the sea, and I will be glorified over the king of Egypt and all his troops, his chariots, and all of his drivers.
\v 18 The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I defeat them."
\p
\v 19 Then the angel of God, who had previously traveled in front of the group of Israelites, moved to the rear. In that way also the cloud pillar moved from front to back,
\v 20 between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of the Israelites. At night, the cloud brought darkness to the Egyptians, but gave light to the Israelites. In that way the Egyptians could not approach the Israelites all night.
\p
\v 21 Then Moses directed his hand over the sea, and the LORD made the east wind blow very hard all night so that the sea water was split in half and the foundation of the sea became dry.
\v 22 The Israelites walked on dry ground across the sea, while their left and right sides were fenced in by a wall of water.
\v 23 The Egyptians— all the horses, the horsemen troops, and war chariots— chased the Israelites into the middle of the sea.
\v 24 Just before morning, the LORD, who was in the pillar of fire and cloud, looked down at the Egyptian troops and confused them.
\v 25 He made the wheels of the Egyptian army's chariots jam, so that they had difficulty advancing. The Egyptians said, "Let's run from here! The Lord is fighting for the Israelites against us!"
\p
\v 26 The LORD said to Moses, "Direct your hand over the sea, so that the waters of the sea will return to cover the Egyptians, the chariot troops and their horsemen troops."
\v 27 So Moses directed his hand over the sea, and at the time just before morning, the sea became one as before. The Egyptians tried to escape, but the LORD drowned them in the middle of the sea.
\v 28 The seawater returned to one and covered the Egyptian king's chariots, horsemen, and all the Egyptian soldiers who chased the Israelites into the middle of the sea. Not even one person was saved.
\p
\v 29 But the Israelites crossed the sea on dry groundfenced in with a wall of water on their left and right sides.
\v 30 On that day the LORD saved the Israelites from the Egyptians, and the Israelites watched the Egyptians die and be washed up on the beach.
\v 31 When the Israelites saw how great the LORD's power was over the Egyptians, they became respectful and afraid of the LORD and they believed in Him and also in Moses, His servant.
