\c 8
\s1 The second plague: Frogs
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Go to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘This is what the LORD says, “Let my people go so that they can worship me.
\v 2 If you refuse, I will fill your country with frogs.
\v 3 The Nile will be full of frogs, and the frogs will enter your palace, your bedroom, your bed, the houses of your employees and all of your people, even in all the kilns and also in your cooking utensils.
\v 4 The frogs will jump on your body, and on the bodies of all your employees and your people.”’”
\p
\v 5 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to extend the rod in his hand over all the rivers, streams of water, and ponds. Make frogs appear all over the land of Egypt!”
\v 6 So Aaron extended his hand over the waters of Egypt, then frogs came out and covered all of Egypt.
\v 7 But the magicians of the land also did the same thing with their magic, and the frogs came out to occupy Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then the king called Moses and Aaron to come and said to them, “Beg the LORD to eliminate the frogs from me and my people, so I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.”
\p
\v 9 Moses answered, “Determine the time, then I will pray to the LORD and ask that all the frogs be removed from you, from your employees, from your people, and also from your homes. Frogs will only be on the Nile. ”
\p
\v 10 The king answered, “Tomorrow.”
\p So Moses said, “It will happen according to your request, so that you know that there is no god like the LORD, our God.
\v 11 The frogs will go away from you, from your employees, from your people, and from your homes. The frogs will only live in the Nile.”
\p
\v 12 Then Moses and Aaron left the king, and Moses prayed, “LORD, remove the plague of frogs that You have brought to the king of Egypt.”
\v 13 And the LORD granted what Moses asked. All frogs that were inside homes, in the courtyards, and in the fields died.
\v 14 Then the Egyptians gathered the carcasses of the frogs so that the whole country stank.
\v 15 But when the king saw that they had been freed from the frogs, he hardened his heart and changed his mind and did not want to listen to them — as the LORD had said.
\s1 The third plague: Gnats
\p
\v 16 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, 'Lift up your staff and beat it to the ground, then the dust will turn into agas \f + \fr 8:16 \fk agas \ft In the Hebrew text the word כִּנִּים (kinnim) is used ) which is interpreted as a kind of small insect that is very disturbing. Aside from as agas ’some other translations use types of insects such as fleas, mosquitoes, and flies. \f* that will fill the entire country of Egypt.’”
\v 17 And it happened like that. Aaron held out the staff in his hand and struck it on the dusty ground, so the dust all over Egypt turned into gnats and came upon all the people and animals. All the dust of the land turned into gnats throughout Egypt.
\v 18 Sorcerers tried with all their abilities to do the same thing, but they failed to make gnats from dust. And the gnats descended on the humans and animals.
\p
\v 19 Then the sorcerers said to the king, “This must be the work of God.“ But as the LORD had said before, the king still insisted and did not listen to them.
\s1 The fourth plague: Flies
\p
\v 20 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tomorrow you must get up very early, and go before the king when he goes down to the river. Tell him, ‘This is what the LORD says to you,“Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
\v 21 If you do not let my people go, I will send a throng of flies on you, all your servants and your people and inside your homes. All Egyptian homes will be filled with flies, even the land where you stand will be filled with flies.
\v 22 But on that day, I will distinguish the place where my people live in Goshen. There will be free from the throng of flies, so that you may know that I, the LORD, am in this country.
\v 23 I will distinguish between my people and your people. This sign will happen tomorrow. ”’”
\p
\v 24 And the LORD did what He said. Throngs of flies filled the king's palace, and the houses of employees. The flies filled the whole country.
\p
\v 25 After that, the king called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, offer sacrifice to your God, but in this land alone.“
\p
\v 26 But Moses answered, “We cannot do that, because offering the burnt sacrifice to the LORD, our God, is something that is disgusting for the Egyptioans. If we do that in front of them, then they will surely throw stones at us.
