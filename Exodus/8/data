\s1 Second disaster: Frogs
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Go to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘This is what the LORD says, “Let my people go so that they can worship me.
\v 2 If you refuse, I will fill your country with frogs.
\v 3 The Nile will be full of frogs, and the frogs will enter your palace, your bedroom, your bed, the houses of your employees and all of your people, even in all the kilns and also in your cooking utensils.
\v 4 The frogs will jump on your body, and on the bodies of all your employees and your people.”’”
\p
\v 5 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to extend the rod in his hand over all the rivers, streams of water, and ponds. Make frogs appear all over the land of Egypt!”
\v 6 So Aaron extended his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came out and covered all of Egypt.
\v 7 But the magicians of the land also did the same thing with their magic, and the frogs came out to meet Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then the king called Moses and Aaron to face and said to them, “Ask the LORD to eliminate the frogs from me and my people, so I will let your people go and offer sacrifices to the LORD.“
\p
\v 9 Moses answered, “Determine the time, then I will pray to the LORD and ask that all the frogs be removed from you, from your employees, from your people, and also from your homes. Frogs will only be on the Nile. “
\p
\v 10 The king answered, “Tomorrow.“
\p So Moses said, “It will happen according to your request, so that you know that there is no god like God, our God.
\v 11 The frogs will get away from you, from your employees, from your people, and from your homes. The frogs will only live in the Nile. “
\p
\v 12 Then Moses and Aaron left the king, and Moses prayed, “Lord, remove the catastrophe that you have brought to the king of Egypt.“
\v 13 And the Lord granted what Moses asked. All frogs that exist in homes, in the courtyards, and in dead fields.
\v 14 Then the Egyptians gathered the carcasses of the frogs so that the whole country stank.
\v 15 But when the king saw that they had been freed from the frogs, he hardened his heart and changed his mind and would not listen to them - as the Lord said.
\s1 Third disaster: Agas
\p
\v 16 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, 'Lift up your staff and beat it to the ground, then the dust will turn into agas \f + \fr 8:16 \fk agas \ft In the Hebrew text the word כִּנִּים (kinnim) is used ) which is interpreted as a kind of small insect that is very disturbing. Aside from as agas ’some other translations use types of insects such as fleas, mosquitoes, and flies. \f* that will fill the entire country of Egypt.’ “
\v 17 And this happened. Aaron held out the stick in his hand and struck it on the dusty ground, so the dust all over Egypt turned into agas and came upon all people and animals. All the dust of the land turned into agas throughout Egypt.
\v 18 Witches try their best to do the same thing, but they fail to make gnats from dust. And the agas alight in humans and animals.
\p
\v 19 Then the sorcerers said to the king, “This must be the work of God.“ But as the Lord had said before, the king still insisted and did not listen to them.
\s1 The fourth disaster: Flies
\p
\v 20 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tomorrow you must get up early in the morning, and go to the king when he goes down into the river. Tell him, “This is what the Lord says to you,“ Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
\v 21 If you do not let my people go, I will send a crowd of flies to you, all your servants and your people and into your homes. All Egyptian homes will be filled with flies, even the land where you stand will be filled with flies.
\v 22 But on that day, I will distinguish the place where my people live in Goshen. There will be free from the crowd of flies, so that you may know that I, the LORD, are in this country.
\v 23 I will distinguish between my people and your people. This sign will happen tomorrow. “’ “
\p
\v 24 And the Lord does what He says. Crowds of flies filled the king's palace, and the houses of employees. The flies filled the whole country.
\p
\v 25 After that, the king called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, offer sacrifice to your God, but in this land alone.“
\p
\v 26 But Moses answered, “We cannot do that, because offering the burnt sacrifice to the Lord our God is something that
