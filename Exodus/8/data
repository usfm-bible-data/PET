\c 8
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Go to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘This is what the LORD says, “Let My people go so that they may worship Me.
\v 2 If you refuse, I will fill your country with frogs.
\v 3 The Nile River will be full of frogs, and the frogs will enter your palace, your bedroom, your bed, the houses of your employees and all of your people, even in all of the food ovens, and also in your cooking utensils.
\v 4 The frogs will jump on your body, and on the bodies of all your employees and your people.”’”
\p
\v 5 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron to extend the staff that is in his hand over all the rivers, streams of water, and ponds. Make frogs appear to fill all the land of Egypt!”
\v 6 So Aaron extended his staff over the waters of Egypt, then frogs came out and covered all of Egypt.
\v 7 But the sorcerers of the land also did the same thing with their magic, and the frogs came out to fill Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then the king called Moses and Aaron to approach and said to them, “Beg the Lord to get rid of the frogs from me and my people, then I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to your god, (named) the Lord.”
\p
\v 9 Moses answered, “Determine the time, then I will pray to the LORD and ask that all of the frogs be gotten rid of from you, from your employees, from your people, and also from your homes. Frogs will only be in the Nile River. ”
\p
\v 10 The king answered, “Tomorrow at the latest.”
\p So Moses said, “It will happen according to your request, so that you know that there is no god like the LORD, our God.
\v 11 The frogs will go away from you, from your employees, from your people, and from your homes. The frogs will only stay in the Nile River.”
\p
\v 12 Then Moses and Aaron left the king,s. According to his promise to the king of Egypt, Moses called out in his prayer to the LORD, asking for the plague of frogs to be removed.
\v 13 And the LORD granted what Moses asked. All of the frogs that were inside each house, in the yards, and in the fields died.
\v 14 Then the Egyptians gathered the carcasses of the frogs, and the whole country stank.
\v 15 But when the king saw that they had been freed from the frogs, he hardened his heart again and didn't want to listen to them, as the LORD had said.
\s1 The third disaster: Gnats
\p
\v 16 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, 'Lift up your staff and hit it on the ground, then the dust will turn into gnats \f + \fr 8:16 \fk gnats \ft In the Hebrew language text the word כִּנִּים 'kinnim' is used which is interpreted as a kind of very small insect and is very disturbing. Aside from ‘gnats’ some other translations use types of insects such as fleas, mosquitoes, and flies. \f* that will fill the entire country of Egypt.’”
\v 17 And it happened like that. Aaron held out the staff in his hand and struck it on the dusty ground, so the dust all over Egypt changed to become gnats and landed on all of the people and animals. All the dust of the land changed to become gnats throughout Egypt.
\v 18 The gnats landed on the humans and animals.The sorcerers tried with all of their abilities to do the same thing, however they failed to make gnats from dust.
\p
\v 19 Then the sorcerers said to the king, “This must be the work of the God of Moses and Aaron!“ But as the LORD had said before, the king still persisted and did not want to listen to them.
\s1 The fourth disaster: Flies
\p
\v 20 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tomorrow you must get up very early, and go before the king when he goes down to the river. Tell him, ‘This is what the LORD says to you,“Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
\v 21 If you do not let My people go, I will send swarms of flies on you, on all of your employees along with your people, and inside of your homes. All Egyptian peoples' homes will be filled with flies, even the land where you stand will be filled with flies.
\v 22 But on that day, I will distinguish the place where My people live in Goshen. There it will be free from the swarms of flies, so that you may know that I, the LORD, am in this country.
\v 23 I will distinguish between My people and your people. This sign will happen tomorrow. ”’”
\p
\v 24 And the LORD did what He said. Swarms of flies filled the king's palace, and the houses of employees. The flies filled the whole country.
\p
\v 25 After that, the king called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Go, offer sacrifices to your God, but just in this land.“
\p
\v 26 But Moses answered, “We cannot do that, because offering burnt sacrifices to the LORD, our God, is something that is disgusting for the Egyptians. If we do that in front of them, then they will surely throw stones at us.
\v 27 In order to do sacrifices according to the orders of the LORD whom we worship, we have to do a three day journey into the wilderness."
\p
\v 28 The king responded to them saying, "I will allow you all to go to offer sacrifices to the LORD, your God, in the wilderness, however don't go too far. And I ask you to pray for me."
\p
\v 29 Then Moses said, "I will leave you and will ask the LORD so that the swarms of flies leave you, your employees, and your people. However this time, king, don't cheat again by forbidding the nation of Israel to go offer sacrifices to the LORD!"
\p
\v 30 So Moses went and left the king and prayed to the LORD.
\v 31 And the LORD did what Moses requested by getting rid of the swarms of flies from the king, his employees along with his people. Not one fly remained.
\v 32 However this time, the king hardened his heart again and didn't allow the nation of Israel to go.
