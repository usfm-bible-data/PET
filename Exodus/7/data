\s 1 Moses went to the king of Egypt
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I lift you up as God for the king of Egypt, and your brother Aaron will be like your prophet.
\v 2 You will say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron will tell the king to let the Israelites out of their land.
\v 3 But I will harden the king's heart. Even though I made many of my signs and wonders in Egypt,
\v 4 he still won't listen to you. Then by My power, I will severely punish the Egyptians, and will bring My people - who are like forces,\f + \fr 7:4 \fk Israel's forces \ft See 6:26 and footnote.\f* comes out from there.
\v 5 And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I punish Egypt with My power and bring forth My people Israel from among them. “
\p
\v 6 So Moses and Aaron did according to what the LORD commanded.
\v 7 When they go to the king, Moses is eighty years old and Aaron is eighty-three years old.
\s Aaron's stick turns into a snake
\p
\v 8 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,
\v 9 “If the king of Egypt says to you,“ Prove yourself by doing miracles, “then say to Aaron,“ Take your staff and throw it to the ground before the king. “Then the stick will turn into a snake.“
\p
\v 10 So Moses and Aaron went to the king and did as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff in front of the king and his officials, and the stick turned into a snake.
\v 11 Then the king summoned smart people and shamans to face, and they - the Egyptian sorcerers, also did the same thing using their magic.
\v 12 Each of them threw his staff, and the sticks turned into snakes. But Aaron's staff swallowed all their sticks.
\v 13 Nevertheless, the king still hardens his heart, as the Lord has said.
\s1 First disaster: Water becomes blood
\p
\v 14 Then the LORD said to Moses, “The king of Egypt remains stubborn. He still refused to let the Israelites leave.
\v 15 So tomorrow morning he came to him, when he usually went to the bank of the Nile. When you see him walking towards the Nile, wait by the river to meet him. Bring a stick that turns into a snake in your hand.
\v 16 And say unto him, ‘LORD, the God of the Hebrews has sent me to say unto you,“ Let my people go so that they may worship me in the wilderness. “But until now you still don't listen.
\v 17 So this is what the Lord says, ‘With this you will know that I am the Lord. 'Look! I will hit the surface of the Nile with this stick in my hand, and the water will turn to blood.
\v 18 Fish in the Nile will die so the Nile will stink and Egyptians cannot drink the river's water. ''
\p
\v 19 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over all the waters of Egypt, over the rivers, streams of water, ponds and places to hold water so that it all turns into blood. There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in water storage made of wood or stone. '
\p
\v 20 Moses and Aaron did what the LORD commanded. In the eyes of the king and his officials, Aaron raised his staff and struck the waters of the Nile, and the water turned to blood.
\v 21 And the fish died in the Nile, so that the water smelled very bad and the Egyptians could not drink the river water. There is blood all over Egypt.
\v 22 But Egyptian sorcerers also did the same thing using their magic. So the king kept hardening his heart and did not listen to them as the Lord had said.
\v 23 The king turns and returns to his palace regardless of what has happened.
\v 24 All Egyptians dig holes along the Nile to find potable water, because they cannot drink the water of the Nile.
\p
\v 25 Seven days passed after the Lord turned the waters of the Nile into blood.
