\s 1 God prepares Moses to go before the king of Egypt
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I'm lifting you up to become as God for the king of Egypt, and your older sibling Aaron will be like your prophet.
\v 2 You will say everything that I command you, and your older sibling Aaron will tell the king to let the people of Israel go out of their land.
\v 3 But I will harden the king's heart. Even though I make various of My wonders in Egypt,
\v 4 he still won't listen to you. Then by My power, I will severely punish the nation of Egypt, and will bring My people, who are like troops,\f + \fr 7:4 \fk Troops \ft See 6:26 and footnote.\f* out from there.
\v 5 And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD, when I punish Egypt with My power and bring out My people Israel from among them.”
\p
\v 6 So Moses and Aaron did according to what the LORD commanded.
\v 7 When they went before the king, Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three years old.
\s Aaron's staff changed to become a snake
\p
\v 8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
\v 9 “If the king of Egypt says to you, ‘Prove yourselves by doing miracles,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it to the ground before the king.’ Then the staff will change to become a snake.”
\p
\v 10 So Moses and Aaron went before the king and did as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff in front of the king and his officials, and the staff changed to become a snake.
\v 11 Then the king summoned the smart people and sorcerers to come, and they also did the same thing using their magic.
\v 12 Each of them threw their staffs, and the staffs turned into snakes. But Aaron's staff swallowed all of their staffs.
\v 13 Nevertheless, the king still hardened his heart, as the LORD had said.
\s1 The first disaster: Water becomes blood
\p
\v 14 Then the LORD said to Moses, “The king of Egypt remains hard hearted. He still refuses to let the people of Israel leave.
\v 15 Because of that tomorrow morning go to him, when he usually goes to the bank of the Nile River. When you see him walking towards the Nile River, wait by the river's edge to meet him. Bring the staff that changed to become a snake in your hand.
\v 16 And say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the people of Israel has sent me to say to you, “Let My people go so that they may worship Me in the wilderness.” But up till now you still don't want to listen.
\v 17 So this is what the LORD says, “With this you will know that I am the Lord. Look! I will strike the surface of the Nile River with this staff in my hand, and the water will turn to blood.
\v 18 Fish in the river will die so the water will stink and Egyptians cannot drink it.’”
\p
\v 19 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch it out over all kinds of waters of Egypt— including the rivers, streams of water, ponds and places to hold water— so that it all changes to become blood. There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in water storage places made of wood or stone.’”
\p
\v 20 Moses and Aaron did what the LORD commanded. In the eyes of the king and his officials, Aaron raised his staff and struck the waters of the Nile River, and all the water turned to blood.
\v 21 And the fish died in the river, so that the water smelled very bad and the Egyptians could not drink the water. There was blood all over Egypt.
\v 22 However the Egyptian sorcerers also did the same thing using their magic. So the king still hardened his heart and did not listen to them as the LORD had said.
\v 23 The king turned around and returned to his palace without regarding what had happened.
\v 24 All the Egyptians dug holes along the Nile River to find water that could be drunk, because they could not drink the water of the Nile River.
\s1 The Second Disaster: Frogs
\p
\v 25 Seven days passed after the LORD had turned the waters of the Nile River into blood.
