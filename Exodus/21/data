\s The rights of Hebrew slaves
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “These are the rules that you have to set for them:
\p
\v 2 When you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve for six years and he must also be freed on the seventh year, without paying anything.
\v 3 If he is still alone and was not yet married when he became your slave, then he will also go out alone. But if he already had a wife when he became your wife, then his wife will go out with him.
\p
\v 4 “If his master gave a wife when he was still a slave, and they have sons or daughters, then his wife and children will be owned by the master and he will go out alone.
\v 5 However if that slave declares, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I don’t want to be freed’,
\v 6 then his master has to bring him to God, and then bring him to the door or the doorpost and make a hole on his ear lobe. In that way, the slave will become owned by the master for his whole lifetime.
\p
\v 7 “If a father sells his daughter as a slave, then that woman will not be freed after six years, unlike male slaves.
\v 8 If that woman is not liked by the master that bought her for himself, then that master must allow the father of that woman to redeem her back. The master may not sell her to a foreigner, because he is the one who breaks his promise to that woman.
\v 9 And if that master buys that woman to be married off with his son, he may not treat that woman as a slave, but he must treat her like his own daughter.
\v 10 If a master who marries his slave takes other women for him to marry, he may not reduce to food or clothing that he provide to that woman, and continues to have sexual relations with her.
\v 11 If he does not fulfill those three things, then that woman must be released without having to pay any kind of redemption fee.
\p
\v 12 “Anyone who hits his fellow so that he died, he must be given death punishment.
\v 13 But if that murder is not intentional and God allows it to happen, then I will decide on a place of protection where that person may run away.
\v 14 But if someone intentionally kills his fellow, then that person must be captured even though he refuge
