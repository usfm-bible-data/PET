\s The rights of Hebrew slaves
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “These are the regulations that you have to set for them:
\p
\v 2 When you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve for six years and he must also be freed on the seventh year, without paying anything.
\v 3 If he is still alone and was not yet married when he became your slave, then he will also go out alone. But if he already had a wife when he became your slave, then his wife will go out with him.
\p
\v 4 “If his master gave a wife to him while he was still a slave, and they have sons or daughters, then his wife and children will be owned by the master and he will go out alone.
\v 5 However if that slave declares, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I don’t want to be freed’,
\v 6 then his master has to bring him to God, and then bring him to the door or the doorpost and make a hole in his ear lobe. In that way, the slave will become the possession of his master for his whole lifetime.
\p
\v 7 “If a father sells his daughter as a slave, then that woman will not be freed after six years, unlike male slaves.
\v 8 If that woman is not liked by the master that bought her for himself, then that master must allow the father of that woman to redeem her back. The master may not sell her to a foreigner, because he is the one who broke his promise to that woman.
\v 9 And if that master buys that woman to be married to his son, he may not treat that woman as a slave, but he must treat her like his own daughter.
\v 10 If a master who marries his slave takes another woman to be his wife, he may not reduce the food or clothing that he provides to that woman, along with continuing to have intimate relations with her.
\v 11 If he does not fulfill those three things, then that woman must be released without having to pay any redemption fee.
\p
\v 12 “Anyone who hits his fellowman so that he dies, he must be given the death sentence.
\v 13 But if that murder was not done intentionally and God allowed it to happen, then I will determine a place of protection to which that person may run.
\v 14 But if someone intentionally kills his fellowman, then that person must be captured even though he takes refuge in My altar and he as to be sentenced to die.
\p
\v 15 “Whoever opposes his father or mother, must be sentenced to die.
\p
\v 16 “Whoever kidnaps must be killed, whether the person kidnapped has been sold as a slave, or is still with him.
\p
\v 17 “Whoever curses his father or mother, must be sentenced to die.
\p
\v 18 “If two people fight, and one person hits the other with a stone or punches him so that he cannot get up from his bed, but doesn't die,
\v 19 then if the injured person heals and can walk again, even though with a cane, the person who hit him will be released from punishment. He only has to pay all the loss caused by his unemployment during the healing and bear the treatment costs for that person.
\p
\v 20 “If a master hits his male or female slave with a stick so that the slave dies, he must be punished.
\v 21 But if that slave can survive a day or several days later, then the master will not be punished, because the slave is his possession.
\p
\v 22 “If two people fight, and one of them unintentionally hits a pregnant lady so that she experiences a miscarriage, but no other injury or pain, then the person who hits her must pay a fine to the husband of that woman. The fine must be according to the amount demanded by the husband and approved by a judge.
\v 23 If that lady is badly injured, then the person who injured her must be punished according to the consequence of his actions: life for life,
\v 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\v 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
\p
\v 26 “If a master hits the eye of a male or female slave to blind it, he must release that slave as retribution for the ruined eye.
\v 27 If that master hits the tooth of a male or female slave so that it comes off, then he has to free that slave as retribution for the tooth that came off.
\p
\v 28 “If an ox gores a man or woman to death, then that ox will be stoned and the meat may not be eaten. But the owner of the ox will not be punished.
\v 29 But if that ox has often gored people and the owner has been warned but he does not guard it well, then the ox must be stoned to death, and the owner also must be sentenced to die.
\v 30 But, if the family of the person who is killed determine a redemption fee for the owner of the ox, then the owner of the ox must pay the amount that is demanded in order to redeem his life.
\p
\v 31 “The same thing is also valid if that ox gores a boy or girl.
\v 32 If the ox gores a male or female servant, the owner of the ox must pay thirty pieces of silver to the owner of the slave and that ox will be stoned to death.
\p
\v 33 If someone opens the cover of a pond or digs a pond and does not cover it, then an ox or donkey falls into it,
\v 34 the owner of the pond must pay to reimburse the owner of that animal and the dead animal that died becomes his possession.
\p
\v 35 “If an ox owned by a person injures his neighbor's ox so that it dies, then they have to sell the ox that is alive and divide the money between them. They must also divide the meat of the ox that died.
\v 36 But if it is known that the ox indeed liked to gore previously, and the owner did not guard it well, then he has to pay the loss completely— the ox that is alive to replace the the ox that is dead, and the ox that is dead will become his possession.”
