\s The rights of Hebrew slaves
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “These are the rules that you have to set for them:
\p
\v 2 When you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve for six years and he must also be freed on the seventh year, without paying anything.
\v 3 If he is still alone and was not yet married when he became your slave, then he will also go out alone. But if he already had a wife when he became your wife, then his wife will go out with him.
\p
\v 4 “If his master gave a wife when he was still a slave, and they have sons or daughters, then his wife and children will be owned by the master and he will go out alone.
\v 5 However if that slave declares, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I don’t want to be freed’,
\v 6 then his master has to bring him to God, and then bring him to the door or the doorpost and make a hole on his ear lobe. In that way, the slave will become owned by the master for his whole lifetime.
\p
\v 7 “If a father sells his daughter as a slave, then that woman will not be freed after six years, unlike male slaves.
\v 8 If that woman is not liked by the master that bought her for himself, then that master must allow the father of that woman to redeem her back. The master may not sell her to a foreigner, because he is the one who breaks his promise to that woman.
\v 9 And if that master buys that woman to be married off with his son, he may not treat that woman as a slave, but he must treat her like his own daughter.
\v 10 If a master who marries his slave takes other women for him to marry, he may not reduce to food or clothing that he provide to that woman, and continues to have sexual relations with her.
\v 11 If he does not fulfill those three things, then that woman must be released without having to pay any kind of redemption fee.
\p
\v 12 “Anyone who hits his fellow so that he died, he must be given death punishment.
\v 13 But if that murder is not intentional and God allows it to happen, then I will decide on a place of protection where that person may run away.
\v 14 But if someone intentionally kills his fellow, then that person must be captured even though he takes refuge in My altar and he as to be sentence to death.
\p
\v 15 “Whoever goes against his father or mother, must be sentenced to death.
\p
\v 16 “Whoever kidnap must be killed, whether the person kidnapped has been sold as a slave, or still with him.
\p
\v 17 “Whoever cursed his father or mother, must be sentenced to death.
\p
\v 18 “If two people fight, and one person hits the other with stone or punched him so that he cannot get up from his bed, but not dead,
\v 19 then if the injured person heals and can walk again, eventhough with a stick, the person who hit him will be released from punishment. Only he has to pay all the loss caused by his unemployment during the healing and bear the treatment costs for that person.
\p
\v 20 “If a master hits his male or female slave with a stick so that the slave dies, he must be punished.
\v 21 But if that slave can survive a day or a few days later, then the master will not be punished, because the slave is his.
\p
\v 22 “If two people fight, and one of them unintentionally hits a pregnant lady so that she experiences miscarriage, but no other injury or pain, then the person who hits her must pay a penalty to the husband of that woman. The penalty must be according to the amount demanded by the husband and approved by judge.
\v 23 If that lady is badly injured, then the person who injure her must be punished according to the consequence of his actions: life for life,
\v 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, feet for feet,
\v 25 burnt injury for burnt injury, injury for injury, bruise for bruise.
\p
\v 26 “If a master hits the eye of a male or female slave until blind, he must release that slave as a retribution for the broken eye.
\v 27 If that master hits the teeth of a male or female slave so that it comes off, then he has to free that slave as a retribution of the teeth that came off.
\p
\v 28 “If a bull gores a man or woman to death, then that bull will be stoned and the meat may not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be punished.
\v 29 But if that bull often gores people and the owner has been warned but he does not guard (the bull) well, then the bull must be stoned to death, and the owner also must be stoned to death.
\v 30 But, if the family of the person who is killed determine a redemption fee towards the owner of the bull, then the owner of the bull must pay the amount that is demanded to redeem his life.
\p
\v 31 “The same thing is also valid if that bull gores a boy or girl.
\v 32 If the bull gores a male or female servant, the owner of the bull must pay thirty pieces of silver money to the owner of the slave and that bull will be stoned to death.
\p
\v 33 If someone opens the cover of a pond or digs a pond and not cover it, and then a bull or donkey falls inside it,
\v 34 the owner of the pond must repay the loss to the owner of the animal and the dead animal becomes his.
\p
\v 35 “If a bull owned by someone injures his neighbors bull so that it dies, then they have to sell the bull that is alive and divide the money between them. They must also divide the meat of the bull that is already dead.
\v 36 But if it is known that the bull indeed likes to gore from way before, and the owner did not guard it well, then he has to pay the loss completely— the bull that is alive to replace the the bull that is dead, and the bull that is dead will become his.”
