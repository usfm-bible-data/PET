\s The rights of Hebrew slaves
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “These are the regulations that you have to set for them:
\p
\v 2 When you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve you for six years and he must also be freed on the seventh year without paying anything.
\v 3 If he was not yet married when he became your slave, then he will go out alone. But if he already had a wife when he became your slave, then his wife will go out with him.
\p
\v 4 “If his master gave a wife to him while he was still a slave and they have sons or daughters, then his wife and children will still be owned by the master and he will go out alone.
\v 5 However if that slave declares, ‘I love my master, my wife, and my children. I don’t want to be freed’,
\v 6 then his master has to bring him to God, and then bring him to the door or the doorpost and make a hole in his ear lobe. In that way, the slave will become the possession of his master for his whole lifetime.
\p
\v 7 “If a father sells his daughter as a slave, then that woman will not be freed after six years, unlike male slaves.
\v 8 If the master that bought that woman for himself does not like her, then he must allow the father of that woman to redeem her back. He may not sell that woman to a foreigner because he is the one who broke his promise to that woman.
\v 9 And if that master buys that woman to be married to his son, he may not treat that woman as a slave, but instead treats her like his own daughter.
\v 10 If a master who marries his slave later marries another woman, he may not reduce the food or clothing that he provides to that slave woman, along with continuing to have intimate relations with her.
\v 11 If he does not fulfill those three things, then that slave woman must be released without having to pay any redemption fee.
\p
\v 12 “Anyone who hits his fellowman so that he dies must be given a death sentence.
\v 13 But if that murder was not done intentionally\f + \fr 21:13 not done intentionally \ft Literally, “that person did not wait on him beforehand, but God caused it to happen with his hand.” This death is unintentional and is outside human schemes.\f*, then I will determine a place of protection to which that person may run.
\v 14 But if someone intentionally kills his fellowman, then he must be captured even though he takes refuge at My altar,\f + \fr 21:14 \fk takes refuge at ... \ft The LORD knew that later there would be people who would take refuge at His altar so that they would not be killed unjustly. An innocent person would take refuge at the altar so that the LORD would be a witness if he were killed. But we see that the LORD knew that who were in the wrong would take refuge at His altar to make the appearance of not being in the wrong. One example is found in 1Kings 2:28-35.\f* and must be sentenced to die.
\p
\v 15 “Whoever strikes his father or mother, must be sentenced to die.
\p
\v 16 “Whoever kidnaps must be sentenced to death, whether the person kidnapped has been sold as a slave, or is still with him.
\p
\v 17 “Whoever curses his father or mother must be sentenced to die.
\p
\v 18 “Suppose two people fight, and one person strikes his opponent with a stone or punches him so that his opponent cannot get up from the bed, but doesn't die.
\v 19 If his opponent heals and can walk again, even though with a cane, he will be released from punishment. But he has to pay all the loss caused by his opponent's unemployment during the healing and bear his treatment costs.
\p
\v 20 “If a master hits his male or female slave with a stick so that the slave dies, he must be punished.
\v 21 But if that slave still survive one or two days later, then the master will not be punished, because the slave is his possession.
\p
\v 22 “Suppose two people fight, and one of them unintentionally hits a pregnant lady so that she experiences a miscarriage. If the woman is not badly injured, then the person who hits her must pay a fine to the husband of that woman according to the amount demanded by the husband and approved by a judge.
\v 23 But if that woman is badly injured, then the person who hit her must be punished according to the consequence of his actions: life for life,
\v 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
\v 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
\p
\v 26 “If a master hits the eye of a male or female slave to blind it, he must release that slave as retribution for the ruined eye.
\v 27 If that master hits the tooth of a male or female slave so that it comes off, then he has to free that slave as retribution for the tooth that came off.
\p
\v 28 “If an ox gores a man or woman to death, then that ox will be stoned to death and the meat may not be eaten, but the owner of the ox will not be punished.
\v 29 But if that ox has often gored people and eventhough the owner has been warned, he does not guard it well, then the ox must be stoned to death, and the owner also must be sentenced to die.
\v 30 But, if the family of the person who is dead demands a redemption fee, then the owner of the ox must pay the amount that is demanded in order to redeem his life.
\p
\v 31 “The same thing is also valid if that ox gores a boy or girl.
\v 32 If the ox gores a male or female servant, then the owner of the ox must pay thirty pieces of silver to the owner of the slave and that ox will be stoned to death.
\p
\v 33 If someone opens the cover of a pond or digs a pond and does not cover it, and then an ox or donkey falls into it,
\v 34 the owner of the pond must pay to reimburse the owner of that animal and the dead animal that died becomes his possession.
\p
\v 35 “If an ox owned by a person injures his neighbor's ox so that it dies, then they have to sell the ox that is alive and divide the money between them. They must also divide the meat of the ox that died.
\v 36 But if the ox indeed is known to gore frequently and the owner did not guard it well, then he has to pay the loss completely: he must replace the dead ox with his live ox, and the dead ox will become his possession.”
