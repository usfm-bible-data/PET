\s1 Bezalel and Aholiab to lead in the making of the LORD's Tent
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 "I have chosen a person from the tribe of Judah named Bezalel. He is the child of Uri, grandson of Hur.
\v 3 I have filled Bezalel with My Spirit and given wisdom, intelligence, and ability in all kinds of crafts—
\v 4 including making designs from gold, silver, and bronze,
\v 5 cutting and attaching precious stones, making wood carvings, along with all kinds of other crafts.
\v 6 I have also chosen Aholiab to help his work. He is the child of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan. I also have given ability to all of the craftsmen to make all that I have commanded to them:
\li2
\v 7 My tent, Covenant Box, the cover on top of that box, and all of the equipment for that tent,
\li2
\v 8 the table and all of its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all of its utensils, the incense altar,
\li2
\v 9 the altar of burnt offering along with its utensils, the vessel of bronze for cleansing and its base,
\li2
\v 10 the beautiful and special clothing— both that to be used by Aaron as priest and the clothing to be used by his children when they served as priests.
\li2
\v 11 the anointing oil, and the incense for the Holy Room.
\m They have to make all of it according to My commands."
\s1 Warning regarding the Sabbath Day
\p
\v 12 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 13 "Say to the Israelites: Every person from among all of you has to obey the regulations regarding the Sabbath day. Because I have appointed the Sabbath day as a sign, from generation to generation, that you obey the promise between Me and you. In that way you each will remember that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
\v 14 You all have to obey the Sabbath day regulations, because that day is holy to you all. Whoever doesn't respect it will be sentenced to die and every one that works on that day will be cut off from the public.
\v 15 For six days you may work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath day, to rest completely which is holy to Me. Whoever keeps working on the Sabbath day will be sentenced to die.
\v 16 The Israelites have to continue to guard the Sabbath day and obey in a generation to generation way forever.
\v 17 This is a sign between Me and them forever. For six days, I , the LORD, created the sky and earth and on the seventh day I stopped working and rested."
\p
\v 18 After the LORD was done talking to Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave two stone tablets to Moses that contained the laws which were written by God's finger.
