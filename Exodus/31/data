\c 31
\s1 Bezalel and Aholiab are chosen to lead in the making of the LORD's Tent
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 “To lead all the tasks in making My tent, I have chosen a person named Bezalel, from the tribe of Judah. He is the son of Uri, grandson of Hur.
\v 3 I have filled Bezalel with My Spirit and given wisdom, intelligence, and ability in all kinds of crafts—
\v 4 including making designs from gold, silver, and bronze,
\v 5 cutting and attaching precious stones, making wood carvings, along with all kinds of other crafts.
\v 6 I have also chosen Aholiab to help his work. He is the child of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan. I also have given ability to all of the craftsmen to make all that I have commanded to them:
\li2
\v 7 My tent, Covenant Box, the cover of it that is called the Throne of Reconciliation, and all of the equipment for that tent,
\li2
\v 8 the table and all of its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all of its utensils, the incense altar,
\li2
\v 9 the altar of burnt offering along with its utensils, the vessel of bronze for cleansing and its base,
\li2
\v 10 the priests’ beautiful clothing, which are set apart for Aaron and his sons when they are on duty serving as priests,
\li2
\v 11 the anointing oil, and the incense for the Holy Room.
\m They have to make all of it according to My commands."
\s1 Warning regarding the Sabbath Day
\p
\v 12 The LORD said to Moses,
\v 13 "Say to the Israelites: Every person from among all of you has to obey the regulations regarding the Sabbath day. Because I have appointed the Sabbath day as a sign, from generation to generation, that you obey the promise between Me and you. In that way you will remember that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.
\v 14 Obey all the rules which I have made about the Sabbath day and always onide that day as holy. Anyone who doesn't respect it will be sentenced to die, and every one that works on that day must no longer be considered as my people.
\v 15 For six days you may work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath day, the day for complete rest that you set apart for Me. Whoever keeps on working on the Sabbath day will be sentenced to die.
\v 16 The Israelites have to continue to guard the Sabbath day and obey in a generation to generation way forever.
\v 17 Because, for in six days I created the heaven, the sky, and the earth, and on the seventh day I stopped working and rested. That is the reason the Sabbath day has become a sign of the covenant between Me and you people of Israel forever.”
\p
\v 18 After the LORD was done talking to Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave two stone tablets to Moses that contained the laws which were written by God's finger.
