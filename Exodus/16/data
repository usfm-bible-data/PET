\s1 The LORD provides food called ‘manna’ and quail birds
\p
\v 1 Then the Israelites left Elim, and on the fifteenth day of the second month, one month\f + \fr 16: 1 \fk one month \ft The Israelites came out of Egypt on the fifteenth day of the first month. See Num. 33:3.\f* after they came out of Egypt, they came to the wilderness of Sin, which lies between Elim and Mount Sinai.
\v 2 In the wilderness the Israelites complained to Moses and Aaron.
\p
\v 3 They said, “It would have been better if the LORD killed us while we were still in Egypt, than for you two to bring us to this wilderness and let us starve to death! At least in Egypt we are never short of food.”
\p
\v 4 So the LORD said to Moses, “I will give you food from heaven, like rain falling from heaven for you. Every day, the people must go out to gather enough food for just that day. I will test whether they will follow my commands or not.
\v 5 But on the sixth day, they will collect twice as much as usual.”
\p
\v 6 Then Moses and Aaron said to all of the Israelites, “At the time of sunset you will know that it was the LORD who brought us (all)/you out of Egypt.
\v 7 Tomorrow morning each of you will see the glory of the LORD, because He has heard your complaints against Him. Because, who are we that you complain against us?!”
\v 8 Then Moses said, “The LORD will give every family meat in the evening and bread in the morning, because the LORD has heard your complaints against Him. Who are we? Actually your complaints are not against us, but against the LORD.”
\p
\v 9 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell all of the Israelites: Come to the LORD, because he has heard your complaints.”
\v 10 While Aaron was speaking to all of the Israelites, suddenly they looked toward the wilderness and the glory of the LORD appeared in a cloud.
\p
\v 11 And the LORD said unto Moses,
\v 12 “I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At the time of sunset every one of you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be full of bread. In that way you will know that I am the LORD your God.’”
\p
\v 13 Then that afternoon many many quail birds came and covered their camp. And in the morning, dew had fallen around their camp.
\v 14 When the dew had evaporated, there appeared something that was thin like scales, and fine like frozen dew covering the surface of the ground.
\v 15 When the Israelites saw that, they asked one another, “What is this?” Because they did not know what it was.
\p Then Moses told them, “This is the food that the Lord has given to us.
\v 16 The LORD commands that each of you all gather as much as needed, which is two liters for each family member.”
\p
\v 17 So the Israelites did this. Some gathered a lot and some gathered a little.
\v 18 But when they measure it, evidently those who collected a lot did not have an excess, and those who gathered a little did not have a deficit. They each gathered the amount that they needed.
\p
\v 19 Then Moses said to them, “Don't leave even a little leftover until morning.”
\v 20 But some of them did not obey Moses. They left some of the food until morning, and the leftover food became wormy and smelled rotten. So Moses was angry with them.
\p
\v 21 Every morning they gathered as much food as they needed. And when the sun got hotter, the food melted.
\v 22 On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much food as usual, which was four liters for each person. When their leaders came and told Moses about it,
\v 23 he said to them, “This is the LORD's command: ‘Tomorrow is the Sabbath day that is set apart especially for the LORD, a day of rest. Cook as much as you want, and save the leftovers that are not eaten today to be eaten tomorrow.’”
\p
\v 24 So they stored the leftovers according to Moses' command. And the next day, the food they stored did not spoil and also didn't have worms.
\v 25 Moses said to them, “Eat this food, because today is the Sabbath day for the LORD, which is a day of rest to honor the LORD, and you will not find that food in the fields.
\v 26 You will gather that food for six days, but the seventh day is a day of rest. The food will not come down on that day.”
\p
\v 27 On the seventh day, some people went out to gather food, but they found nothing at all.
\v 28 Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long will they continue to refuse to obey My commands and My teachings?!
\v 29 They must know that I have given them the seventh day for them to rest. Because of that, on the sixth day I give double the food so that it is enough for two days. On the Sabbath day— the third day— stay in each of your houses and don't go out.”
\v 30 So the Israelites did not work on the seventh day.
\p
\v 31 The Israelites named the food 'manna'. The shape was small like coriander seeds. The color was white, and it tasted like honey cakes.
\p
\v 32 Moses said, “This is the LORD's command: Take two liters of manna and keep it from one generation to another, so that your new generation can see the food that I gave you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of Egypt.”
\p
\v 33 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar, and fill it with manna as much as two liters and keep the jar before the LORD from generation to generation.”
\v 34 Aaron did according to the LORD's command to Moses and kept it in front of the Chest of Promise.
\v 35 The Israelites ate manna for forty years until they arrived in Canaan.
\p
\v 36 The measure of two liters\f + \fr 16:36 \fk two liters \ft Literally, ‘one gomer’.\f* is equal to one tenth of an ephah.
