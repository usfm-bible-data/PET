\s Tenth disaster: Death of firstborn child
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “There is still another plague that I will bring on the king of Egypt and his people. After that, the king will let you all go from Egypt. When he lets you all go, it means he truly will expell you out of this place.
\v 2 Now order the Israelites to ask for gold and silver jewelry from their neighbors who are Egyptians.”
\p
\v 3 The LORD made the Egyptians generous to the Israelites. In fact Moses was highly respected by government officials and the people of Egypt.
\p
\v 4 Then Moses went to the king and said, “The LORD says that later around midnight He will go through all of Egypt.
\v 5 Every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die— from your firstborn who will sit on your throne, to the eldest son of a grain-grinding slave girl. In addition, the firstborn male young born to all cattle will also die.
\v 6 All over Egypt there will be the sound of lamenting that is so loud, which has never happened before and will never happen again.
\v 7 But the nation of Israel will remain safe. In fact not even a dog will bark at them or their animals, so that you know that it is the LORD who has treated the people of Israel differently from the citizens of Egypt.
\v 8 Then all your officials will come and bow before me, saying, ‘Go, you and all your followers!’ And after that I will leave.”
\p Then in great anger Moses left the king of Egypt.
\v 9 The LORD had already said to Moses, “The king of Egypt will not heed your words. This will happen so that I can do many miracles in Egypt.”\x + \xo 11: 9 \xt Ex. 7: 3-4\x*
\v 10 Moses and Aaron did all the previously recounted miracles before the king of Egypt, but the LORD hardened the king's heart so he kept on insisting on not allowing the people of Israel go from his land.
