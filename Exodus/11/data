\s Tenth disaster: Death of firstborn
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “There is still another plague that I will bring to the king of Egypt and his people. After that, the king will let you all go from Egypt. When he lets you all go, it means he truly expell you out of this place.
\v 2 Now tell the Israelites to ask for gold and silver jewelry from their Egyptian neighbors.”
\p
\v 3 The LORD made the Egyptians generous to the Israelites. Moreover Moses was highly respected by government officials and the people of Egypt.
\p
\v 4 Then Moses went to the king and said, “The LORD says that around midnight He will explore all of Egypt.
\v 5 Every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die— from your firstborn who would/will sit on your throne, to the eldest son of a grain-grinding slave girl. In addition, the first male child born to all cattle will also die.
\v 6 All over Egypt there will be such loud voices lamenting, which have never happened before and will never happen again.
\v 7 But the Israelites will remain safe. Not even a dog will bark at them or their animals, so that you know that it is the LORD who has treated the people of Israel differently from the citizens of Egypt.
\v 8 Then all your officials will come and bow before me, saying, ‘Go, you and all your followers!’ And after that I will leave.”
\p Then in great anger Moses left the king of Egypt.
\v 9 The LORD had already said to Moses, “The king of Egypt will not heed your words. That will happen so that I can do many miracles in Egypt.”\x + \xo 11: 9 \xt Ex. 7: 3-4 \x*
\v 10 Moses and Aaron did all the previously recounted miracles before the king of Egypt, but the Lord hardened the king's heart so he kept on stubbornly refusing to let the Israelites leave his country.
