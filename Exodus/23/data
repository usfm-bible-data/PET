\v 16 The second holiday is the Holiday of Harvest. At this celebration, offer the first produce of your harvest to Me.\x + \xo 23:16 \xt Ex. 22:29\x* And the third is the Holiday of Gathering. Celebrate that celebration at the harvest season, when you gather all of the harvest of your gardens and fields.
\v 17 At the third celebration each year, all the males have to face Me, Ruler LORD, at My tent.
\p
\v 18 “When you offer a animal/slaughtered sacrifice don't offer bread that contains yeast.\f + \fr 23:18 \fk animal sacrifice with yeast \ft Literally the source languages says, “Do not offer the blood of a sacrificial victim to me along with anything containing yeast.” This prohibition refers to the practice of offering unleavened bread with all animal sacrifices. The people of Israel never mixed yeast with animal blood.\f* And don't let the fat of the celebration's sacrifice to remain until morning.

\v 20 "I will send an angel to guard you on the journey and guide you toward the place that I have prepared.
\v 21 Pay attention to and obey him. Don't oppose him, because he is My representative.\f + \fr 23:21 \fk he is my representative \ft Literally, ‘My name is in him’. See the footnote at Ex. 3:2.\f* He won't forgive your [rebellion/transgressions].
\v 22 But if you obey him wholeheartedly and do all of My commands, then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and oppose your opponents.
\v 23 My angel will travel in front of you and bring you to the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I will destroy them.
\v 24 Don't worship their gods or copy the way they worship, on the other hand destroy their false gods and their idols.
\p
\v 25 Worship Me, the LORD your God, then I will bless you and you won't lack any food or drink, and I will keep diseases far from you.
\v 26 There won't be any woman in your land that miscarries or is infertile, and I will give you long lives.
\p
\v 27 "I will make all of the enemies that you face fear Me. They will become foggily confused and will run from before you all.
\v 28 I will make the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites so afraid when you all approach them so that they run from you all. \f + \fr 23:28 \fk afraid \ft Literally "I will send hornets before you all to chase out the Hivittes, the Canaanites, and the Hittites from before you all.”\f*.
\v 29 But I won't chase them all at once in one year's time so that the land doesn't lie vacant and wild animals increase greatly so that they endanger you all.
\v 30 I will slowly chase them out so that their numbers decrease greatly in order to dominate the land.
\v 31 I will determine the boundaries of your area from the Red Sea to the Mediteranian Sea, from the wilderness to the Euphrates river. I will surrender the inhabitants of that land to you and you will drive them out.
\p
\v 32 Don't make promises with those people and don't agree to worship their gods.
\v 33 Don't let them live among you. If you all allow them to live there, they will make you all sin toward Me by worshiping their gods, and you all will be caught in that evil."
