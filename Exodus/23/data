Celebrate (this) every year at the appointed time in the month of Abib,\f + \fr 23:15 \fk Abib \ft Abib is the name of the first month in the Hebrew calendar, which is estimated to fall between mid-March to mid-April. See Exo. 12:2.\f*because you came out of Egypt on that month. No one may come before Me without offering an animal sacrifice.
\v 16 The second celebration day is the Day of Harvest. On this celebration, offer your first (grain) harvest to Me. and the third is Day of Gathering. Celebrate this celebration on the end of the harvest season, when you gather all the produce of your gardens and your fields.

\v 21 Pay attention to him and listen to his words. Don’t rebel against him, because he is My representative and he will not forgive your violations.
\v 22 But if you obey him and do all My commands, then I be an enemy to your enemies and oppose your opponents.
\v 23 My angels will walk before you and bring you to the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will destroy them.
\v 24 Don’t worship their gods or imitate the way they worship, but instead destroy their fake gods and their idols.
\p
\v 25 “Worship Me, the LORD your God, then I will bless you and you will not lack food and drink, and I will keep you far from sickness.
\v 26 There will be no woman in your land who will miscarry or be barren, and I will give you long life.
\p
\v 27 “I will make all your enemies that you come to be afraid towards Me. They will panic and run from before you.
\v 28 I will make the Hivites, the Canaanites, and Hittites be so afraid when you draw near, so that they will run from you.\f + \fr 23:28 \fk afraid \ft Literally, “I will send bees to go ahead of you to drive away the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites from before you.”\f*
\v 29 But I will not drive them away all together within one year, so that the land will not be abandoned and wild beasts increase in number so that they become a danger to you.
\v 30 I will slowly drive them away until your number becomes numerous enough to conquer that land.
\v 31 I will determine the boundaries of your areas from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, from the wilderness to the Euphrates River. I will give power over the people who live on that land to you and you will drive them away.
\p
\v 32 “Don’t make agreements/covenants with those tribes and don’t agree to worship their gods.
\v 33 Don’t let them live among you. If you let them live there, they will make you sin against Me by worshipping their gods, and you will be snared in this evilness.”
