\c 33
\s1 The LORD orders the nation of Israel to leave Mount Sinai
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, "Go from this place together with the nation that you brought out of Egypt heading to the land that I have promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saying, 'I will give this land to your descendants.'
\v 2 I will send an angel to travel in front of you and I will chase away the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
\v 3 Go to the land that is rich and fertile. But I won't travel with you because you are a hard headed nation that doesn't obey Me. If I go with you all, I might just destroy you on the road."
\p
\v 4-5 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites: You all are a hard headed nation that doesn't obey. If I travel with you all for one moment, I will destroy you all. Take off all of your jewelry while I decide what I will do to all of you."
\p When the nation of Israel heard that bad news, they were very sad and mourned. Not one person wore his jewelry.
\v 6 So the Israelites didn't wear their jewelry anymore after Mount Sinai.\f + \fr 33:6 \fk Sinai \ft Literally, 'Horeb'. See the footnote in chapter 3:1.\f*
\s1 The Holy Tent outside the campground
\p
\v 7 Usually, when the nation of Israel camped in a place, Moses would set up a tent outside, far from the campground. Moses called it the Holy Tent. Whoever wanted to seek the LORD would go to that tent.
\p
\v 8 Every time Moses went to that tent, all of the nation of Israel would arise and stand in front of the door of each of their tents and pay attention to Moses until he entered the tent.
\v 9 And when Moses entered that tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand in front of the tent's door while the LORD spoke with Moses.
\v 10 When all of the nation of Israel saw the cloud standing in front of the tent's door, they would each kneel and worship at their own tent's door.
\v 11 In that tent, the LORD spoke directly to Moses, as a person speaks to his friend. And when Moses returned to the campground, his servant, Joshua the child of Nun, remained in that tent.
\s1 Moses requests that the LORD be with him
\p
\v 12 Moses said to the LORD; "You ordered me, 'Bring this nation to the land that I promised to them.' But You didn't tell me who You will send to be with me. However You said, 'I know you and am pleased with you.'
\v 13 I request, yes LORD, if I truly am pleasing in Your eyes, tell me Your plan for me so that I know You better and continue to do what pleases You. Remember that this nation is Your people."
\p
\v 14 Then the LORD answered, "I myself will be with you and give you peace."
\p
\v 15 Moses answered, "If You aren't with us, don't order us to leave from here.
\v 16 How will people know that You are pleased with me– I and Your people– if You aren't with us? Isn't what differentiates us from other nations on earth that You are with us?"
\p
\v 17 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will do what you've asked, because I am pleased with you and know you."
\p
\v 18 Then Moses said, "I request, show me the glory of your face."
\p
\v 19 Then the LORD said, "I will make all of my kindness visible in front of you and I will call out My name, 'LORD'. I will be kind and merciful to whoever I want to."
\v 20 But you can't see My face because no one who sees Me can stay alive."
\p
\v 21 Then the LORD continued, "Stand on that rock, near Me.
\v 22 When My glory passes by, I will place you in the cleft of that rock and I will cover you with My hand until I pass by.
\v 23 I will pull away My hand and You will see Me from behind. But you won't see My face."
