\s The fifth disaster: Infectious diseases in animals
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, "Go to the king and say that the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, said,‘ Let my people go so that they can worship me!
\v 2 If you refuse and keep holding them back,
\v 3 Then, by My power, I will bring forth a very severe plague on your livestock — namely horses, donkeys, camels, sheep, goats and cows.
\v 4 But I will distinguish livestock belonging to the Israelites from cattle belonging to the Egyptians. Not one livestock belongs to an Israeli who will die. '
\v 5 The Lord has also determined the time for this to happen. He already said, 'I will do this disaster tomorrow.'
\p
\v 6 The next day, the Lord did according to His words. All the livestock belonging to the Egyptians died, but none of the cattle of Israel died.
\v 7 Then the king sent his messenger to investigate, and rightly so, that none of the cattle of Israel died. Even so, the king hardened his heart, and did not want to let the nation go.
\s Sixth disaster: festering boils
\p
\v 8 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Take some handfuls of ashes from the burning place, and Moses must throw the ashes into the air before the king.
\v 9 That ash will be fine dust that will spread throughout Egypt and cause festering boils to humans and animals throughout Egypt. "
\p
\v 10 So Moses and Aaron took the ashes from the kiln and went to the king. Moses threw the ashes into the air, and festering boils broke on human and animal skin.
\v 11 Witches could not stand before Moses because festering boils broke on their skin and on all Egyptians.
\v 12 But the Lord hardened the king's heart, and as the Lord had said before, the king still ignored their words.
\s Seventh disaster: Hail
\p
\v 13 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tomorrow, get up early and go to the king of Egypt. Say to him: ‘LORD, the God of the Hebrews said,‘ Let my people go so that they can worship me.
\v 14 If not, then this time I will bring disaster to you, your servants, and your people, that you may know that there is nothing like me on this earth.
\v 15 I can use My power to attack you and your people with disease and eliminate you from the surface of the earth.
\v 16 But I let you live for this purpose - that is to show my power to you and thus, my name will be glorified in all the earth.
\v 17 Even so, you are still arrogant and don't let my people go.
\v 18 Tomorrow, around the same time as now, I will bring down the most devastating hail that has never happened before in all of Egypt.
\v 19 Therefore, bring all your cattle in the field to take refuge in a safe place. Everyone and animals that are still in the field will die of hail! '
\p
\v 20 The servants of the king who were afraid of the words of the LORD, immediately brought in all their slaves and livestock to take refuge.
\v 21 But those who ignored the words of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.
\p
\v 22 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Take your hand into the heavens, that the hail will fall on all Egypt, and befall every person, animal and plant in the field.
\p
\v 23 So Moses pointed his wand at the sky and the LORD showered all of Egypt with hail and lightning - which repeatedly struck the ground.
\v 24 Since Egypt became a nation, there has never been a hailstorm that has fallen continuously with a lightning strike like this.
\v 25 Hailstones hit everything in the fields throughout Egypt — be it humans, animals, plants or trees.
\v 26 Only Goshen, the place of residence of the Israelites, was not hit by hail.
\p
\v 27 Then the king called Moses and Aaron to face him and said, "This time I have been guilty. God is right, and I and all my people are wrong.
\v 28 Ask God to stop this awesome hail and lightning. We can't stand it anymore. I will let you go, you don't have to stay any longer! "
\p
\v 29 Moses answered the king, "When I leave this city, I will direct my hand to the Lord. Thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you know that the earth belongs to the Lord.
\v 30 But I know that you and your government officials are still not afraid of the LORD God. "
\p
\v 31 At that time, the barley was almost ready to harvest and flax was flowering so that hail failed to harvest the plants.
\v 32 However, wheat and a little \f + fr 9:32 \fk \ft Sekoi in Hebrew means low-grade wheat. In Egypt, sekoi are harvested after harvesting barley for bread. See Ex. 9:32 and Isa. 28:25. \f* not damaged because it hasn't been in season.
\p
\v 33 Then Moses left the king, went out of the city and raised his hand to the LORD. Then thunder, hail and rain stopped.
\v 34 When the king sees that rain, hail and thunder have stopped, he returns to sin. The king and his officials again hardened their hearts,
\v 35 and the king did not let the Israelites go, according to what the LORD said to Moses.
