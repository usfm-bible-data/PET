\s The fifth plague: Disease that spread in animals
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, “Go before the king and say that the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says, ‘Let My people go so that they can worship Me!
\v 2 If you refuse and keep holding them back,
\v 3 then by My power, I will cause a very severe plague on your livestock— that is on horses, donkeys, camels, sheep, goats and cows.
\v 4 But I will distinguish the livestock that the Israelites possess from the livestock possessed by the Egyptians. Not one of the livestock belonging to the Israelites will die.’
\v 5 The LORD has also determined the time for this to happen. He has said, ‘I will do this disaster tomorrow.’
\p
\v 6 The next day, the LORD did according to His word. All the livestock belonging to the Egyptians died, but none of the livestock of the Israelites died.
\v 7 Then the king sent his messenger to investigate, and it was true, that not one of the livestock of the Israelites had died. Even so, the king hardened his heart, and did not want to let the nation go.
\s The sixth plague: Festering boils
\p
\v 8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take some handfuls of ashes from the oven, and Moses must throw the ashes into the air before the king.
\v 9 Those ashes will become fine dust that will spread throughout Egypt and cause festering boils on humans and animals throughout Egypt. “
\p
\v 10 So Moses and Aaron took the ashes from the oven and went before the king. Moses threw the ashes into the air, and festering boils broke out on the skin of humans and animals.
\v 11 The sorcerers could not stand before Moses because festering boils broke out on their skin and on all the people of Egypt.
\v 12 But the LORD hardened the king's heart, and as the LORD had said before, the king still did not heed their words.
\s The seventh plague: Hail
\p
\v 13 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tomorrow, get up early and go to the king of Egypt. Say to him: ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews says, “Let my people go so that they can worship Me.
\v 14 If not, then this time I will bring disaster to you, your employees, and your people, that you may know that there is no one like Me on this earth.
\v 15 I can use My power to attack you and your people with disease and eliminate you from the surface of the earth.
\v 16 But I let you live for this purpose— that is to show My power to you and in that way, My name will be glorified in all the earth.
\v 17 Even so, you are still just arrogant and will not let My people go.
\v 18 Tomorrow, around the same time as now, I will rain down the most terrible hail that has ever happened before in all of Egypt.
\v 19 Because of that, bring all of your cattle that are in the field to take refuge in a safe place. Every person and animal that are still in the field will die hit by the hail!”’”
\p
\v 20 The servants of the king who were afraid of the words of the LORD immediately brought in all their slaves and livestock to take refuge.
\v 21 But those who didn't heed the words of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.
\p
\v 22 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Direct your hand toward the heavens, that the hail will fall on all Egypt and hit every person, animal and plant in the field.
\p
\v 23 So Moses directed his staff toward the sky and the LORD showered all of Egypt with hail and lightning— which repeatedly struck the ground.
\v 24 Since Egypt became a nation, there had never been hail that fell continuously with lightning strikes like this.
\v 25 Hailstones struck everything in the fields throughout Egypt— both humans, animals, plants or trees.
\v 26 Only Goshen, the place of residence of the people of Israel, was not hit by hail.
\p
\v 27 Then the king called Moses and Aaron to come before him and said, “This time I have been wrong. The LORD is right, and I and all my people are wrong.
\v 28 Ask the LORD to stop this terrible hail and lightning. We can't stand it anymore. I will let you go, you don't have to stay any longer! “
\p
\v 29 Moses answered the king, “When I leave this city, I will direct my hand to the LORD. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you know that the earth belongs to the LORD.
\v 30 But I know that you and your government officials are still not afraid of the LORD God. “
\p
\v 31 At that time, the barley was almost ready to harvest and flax was flowering so that the hail ruined the harvest of those plants.
\v 32 But wheat and spelt \f + fr 9:32 \fk spelt \ft Spelt in Hebrew means a type of wheat regarded as low-grade. In Egypt, spelt is harvested after harvesting barley for making bread. See Ex. 9:32 and Isa. 28:25. \f* were not damaged because it was not yet in season.
\p
\v 33 Then Moses left the king, went out of the city and raised his hand to the LORD. So the thunder, hail and even the rain stopped.
\v 34 When the king saw that the rain, hail and thunder had stopped, he returned to sinning. The king and his officials again hardened their hearts,
\v 35 and the king did not let the people of Israel go, according to what the LORD said to Moses.
