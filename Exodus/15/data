\s The Song of Victory
\p
\v 1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to praise the Lord,
\q1 “I will sing unto the LORD
\q2 because He has won so greatly.
\q1 He has thrown the horses
\q2 and their riders into the sea.
\q1
\v 2 The Lord is my strength
\q2 and therefore I sing.
\q2 It was he who saved me.
\q1 He is my God, I will praise Him,
\q2 He is the God of my father, I will exalt him.
\q1
\v 3 The LORD is a war hero.
\q2 His name is the LORD.
\q1
\v 4 He threw the Egyptian king's war chariots
\q2 and his troops into the sea.
\q1 The best officers,
\q2 He drowned in the Red Sea.
\q1
\v 5 The deep sea swallowed them.
\q2 They sank down at the bottom of the sea like rocks.
\q1
\v 6 Your right hand, yes Lord, was great full of power.
\q2 Your right hand, yes Lord, destroyed the enemy.
\q1
\v 7 With Your great majesty,
\q2 You have destroyed Your enemies.
\q1 You released the fire of Your wrath,
\q2 and burned them like straw.
\q1
\v 8 By Your breath,
\q2 the sea water rolled high,
\q1 stood upright like a wall,
\q2 and the depth of the sea became hard.
\q1
\v 9 The enemy said, ‘I will chase
\q2 and capture them,
\q1 I will share the resulting booty,
\q2 and satisfy my lust for it.
\q1 I will draw my sword
\q2 and destroy them with my hands.’
\q1
\v 10 But with Your breath,
\q2 the sea enveloped them.
\q1 They sank like heavy lead
\q2 in the terrible surge of water.
\q1
\v 11 There is no god like You, yes Lord!
\q2 You are great in Your holiness,
\q2 are admired and praised for Your marvelous deeds,
\q1 You are a miracle worker.
\q1
\v 12 You stretched out Your right hand,
\q2 and the earth just swallowed them.
\q1
\v 13 With Your steadfast love,
\q2 You led those whom You have redeemed.
\q1 With Your strength, You guided them
\q2 toward Your holy place of residence.
\q1
\v 14 Other nations heard of Your deeds, and they trembled in fear.
\q2 A great fear gripped the Philistines.
\q1
\v 15 The leaders of Edom were shaken, the leaders of Moab trembled.
\q1 All who lived in Canaan went limp with fear.
\q1
\v 16 They will feel revulsion and fear when they witness Your power,
\q2 and they will be silent as a rock,
\q1 until Your people, oh LORD, whom You redeemed,
\q2 traveled past them.
\q1
\v 17 You will bring your people to the top of Your mountain,
\q2 where You made Your residence, Yes Lord,
\q2 the holy place that You established with Your own hand, oh our Lord.
\q1
\v 18 You are, yes Lord, the one in power and govern
\q2 forever and ever!”

\p
\v 19 When the Israelites walked across the sea on dry ground, the horses of the king of Egypt and his horsemen and war chariots chased them into the sea, then the LORD made the wall of water become one as before and washed them away.
\p
\v 20 Then Miriam, who was Aaron's older sister and a prophetess, took a tambourine and beat it while dancing. Then all of the women followed her,
\v 21 and Miriam led them in singing,
\q1 “Sing to the LORD, because He has won greatly.
\q2 He has thrown the horse troops and their riders into the sea.”
\s The LORD changed bitter water into drinkable water
\p
\v 22 Then Moses led the Israelites away from the Red Sea heading for the wilderness of Shur. They walked for three days in the wilderness and found no water.
\v 23 When they arrived at Marah, they found water, but the water there could not be drunk because it was bitter. That is why the place was named ‘Marah’, which means ‘bitter’.
\p
\v 24 So they complained to Moses and said, “What will we drink?”
\p
\v 25 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw the wood into the water, and the water turned into fresh water so it could be drunk.
\p Then also at that place the LORD gave the following order as a measure to test their individual obedience,
\v 26 by saying, “Truly obey Me the Lord your God, follow all of My commandments and do what I see is good, so I will not punish you with various diseases, as I did to the Egyptians. I am the Lord who heals every one among you.”\f + \fr 15:26 \fk I am the LORD … \ft Literally (the root form) is ‘Yahweh Rafa’, which is a poetic saying which pictures the LORD’s power to heal. This poetic saying can be compared to ‘the LORD my walled fortress’, and a number of such sayings. See 2Sam. 22:3.\f*
\p
\v 27 After this they arrived at Elim. There were twelve springs and seventy palm trees there. They camped near the spring.
