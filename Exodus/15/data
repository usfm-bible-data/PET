\s The Song of Victory
\p
\v 1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to praise the Lord,
\q1 “I will sing unto the LORD
\q2 because He has won so greatly.
\q1 He has thrown the horses
\q2 and their riders into the sea.
\q1
\v 2 The Lord is my strength and therefore I sing.
\q2 It was he who saved me.
\q1 He is my God, I will praise Him,
\q2 He is the God of my father, I will exalt him.
\q1
\v 3 The LORD is a war hero.
\q2 His name is the LORD.
\q1
\v 4 He threw Egyptian war chariots
\q2 and its armies my into the sea.
\q1 The best officers,
\q2 He sank into the Red Sea.
\q1
\v 5 The deep sea engulfed them.
\q2 They sink to the bottom of the sea like rocks.
\q1
\v 6 Your right hand, O Lord, was powerful.
\q2 Thy right hand, O Lord, destroyed the enemy.
\q1
\v 7 With your great majesty,
\q2 You have destroyed your enemies.
\q1 You released the fire of your wrath,
\q2 and burned them like straw.
\q1
\v 8 By your breath,
\q2 sea water curls high,
\q1 stand tall like a wall,
\q2 and the depth of the sea becomes hard.
\q1
\v 9 The enemy said, ‘I will catch up
\q2 and capture them,
\q1 I will ^^^[divide//distribute//share] the results of the [spoils//booty],
\q2 and satisfy my lust for it.
\q1 I will draw my sword
\q2 and destroy them with my hands.’
\q1
\v 10 But with your breath,
\q2 the sea envelops them.
\q1 They sink like [?heavy tin]
\q2 in the fierce surge of water.
\q1
\v 11 There is no god like You, O Lord!
\q2 You are great in Your holiness,
\q1 are admired and praised for your marvelous deeds,
\q2 You are a miracle worker.
\q1
\v 12 You stretch out your right hand,
\q2 and the earth swallows them.
\q1
\v 13 With your unwavering love, you lead
\q2 those whom you have redeemed.
\q1 With Your strength, You guide them
\q2 go to your holy place of residence.
\q1
\v 14 The Gentiles hear your deeds, and they tremble in fear.
\q2 A great fear is gripping the Philistines.
\q1
\v 15 The leaders of Edom were shaken, the leaders of Moab tremble.
\q1 All who lived in Canaan went limp.
\q1
\v 16 They are very afraid to witness Your power,
\q2 and they will be silent as a rock,
\q1 to thy people, O LORD, which thou redeem,
\q2 walked past them.
\q1
\v 17 You will bring your people up on your mountain,
\q2 where have you made your residence, O Lord?
\q2 to the sanctuary that You established with Your own hand, O our Lord.
\q1
\v 18 You are, O Lord, who rules and reigns forever and ever!”

\p
\v 19 When the Israelites walked across the sea on dry ground, the horses of the king of Egypt and their armies and chariots chased them into the sea, then the Lord made the wall of water to reunite as before and washed them away.
\p
\v 20 Then Nabiah Miryam, Harun's sister took a tambourine and all the women followed her, they beat tambourines while dancing.
\v 21 Miryam sings,
\q1 “Sing to the LORD, because He has won greatly.
\q2 He has thrown his horse and rider into the sea.”
\s The LORD changed bitter water into drinkable water
\p
\v 22 Then Moses led the Israelites away from the Red Sea to the wilderness of Shur. They walked for three days in the wilderness and found no water.
\v 23 When they arrived at Mara, they found water but the water there could not be drunk because it was bitter. That is why the place was named ‘Mara’, which means ‘bitter’.
\p
\v 24 So they murmured to Moses and said, “What shall we drink?”
\p
\v 25 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw the wood into the water, and the water turned into fresh water so it could be drunk.
\p In Mara, the LORD gave decrees and regulations to regulate their way of life and there He tested their obedience,
\v 26 by saying, “Obey I the Lord your God solemnly, follow all my commandments and do what I think is good, so I will not punish you with various diseases, as I did with the Egyptians. I am the Lord who healed you.”
\p
\v 27 After this they arrived at Elim. There are twelve springs and seventy palm trees. They camped near the spring.
