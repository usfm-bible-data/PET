\s Regulations about the Sabbath day
\p
\v 1 Moses called all of the people of Israel to gather and he said to them, "These are the LORD's orders that have to be done:
\v 2 You will work as long as six days in a week, but you have to rest completely on the seventh day, because that day is the Sabbath day, a day that is holy to the LORD. Whoever works on that day will be sentenced to die.
\v 3 You can't light a fire in your houses on the Sabbath day."
\s Many offerings were given to build the LORD’s Tent
\p
\v 4 Then Moses said to all of the people of Israel, "This is the LORD's order:
\v 5 Gather offerings for the LORD which will be used to make the His tent. May each person whose heart is moved bring an offering to the LORD,
\li2 namely gold, and silver, bronze,
\li2
\v 6 red, blue, and purple colored thread,
\li2 fine linen cloth,
\li2 and goat's hair to be woven into cloth,
\li2
\v 7 ram's skin colored red,
\li2 leather that doesn’t absorb water,
\li2 acacia wood,
\li2
\v 8 olive oil for the lamps,
\li2 various fragrant spices from tree sap to mix into anointing oil and incense,
\li2
\v 9 crysoprase jewels and other jewels, to attach on the ephod and breast cover to be worn by the high priest.
\p
\v 10 “May everyone who has skill to make the things ordered by the LORD come. Let us make these things:
\li2
\v 11 All parts of the LORD’s Tent, including the tent and its cloth covering, its clasps, its frames, its wooden cross bars, its posts and its bases,
\li2
\v 12 the Chest of Promise with its carrying poles, the chest's cover, and the curtains that cover that chest,
\li2
\v 13 the table with its carrying poles, all of its utensils and the offering bread,
\li2
\v 14 the branched lampstand for lighting with its equipment and its lamps, and oil for lighting,
\li2
\v 15 the incense altar with its carrying poles, anointing oil and incense, and the entrance curtain of the tent,
\li2
\v 16 the altar of burned sacrifice with its bronze grill, carrying poles and all of its equipment, the bronze water tank with its base,
\li2
\v 17 curtains for the courtyard, the posts, the courtyard gate door curtain,
\v 18 the pegs for the LORD’s Tent and the courtyard fence, with all their ropes,
\li2
\v 19 the beautiful and special clothing for Aaron and his sons, that they would wear while serving in the Holy Room."
\p
\v 20 Then all of the people of Israel left Moses.
\v 21 After that, every person whose heart was moved and motivated came while bringing offerings for the LORD for the work of the LORD’s Tent, the things needed for worship, and priests clothing.
\v 22 Both men and women, all whose hearts were moved brought broches, earrings, rings, necklaces and all kinds of other gold jewelry. They all lifted high their gold as an offering to the LORD.
\v 23 Every person who owned red, blue, and purple thread, fine linen cloth and goat's hair, ram's skins that were colored red, and fine leather came bringing them.
\v 24 And every person who wanted to offer silver or bronze brought them as an offering to the LORD. In that way also every person who had acacia wood brought them to be used in all of the work.
\p
\v 25-26 Each woman who was skilled at spinning brought the products of their spinning, in the form of red, blue, and purple thread. And the women who were skilled in spinning goat's hair brought thread. There also were women who brought their woven fine linen.
\v 27 All of the leaders brought crysoprase jewels and engraved jewels to attach to the ephod and the breast cover,
\v 28 spices and olive oil for lighting, for the anointing oil, and for incense.
\v 29 Both men and women, every Israelite whose hearts were moved brought their offerings willingly to the LORD, to support the work that the LORD ordered through Moses.
\s Bezalel and Aholiab
\p
\v 30 Then Moses said to the Israelites, "The LORD has appointed Bezalel child of Uri, grandson of Hur from the tribe of Judah.
\v 31 The LORD has filled Bezalel with His Spirit and gave him wisdom, skill, and ability in all areas of the work,
\li2
\v 32 including making designs from gold, silver, and bronze,
\li2
\v 33 cutting and attaching jewel stones,
\li2 making wood carvings,
\li2 along with all types of other crafts.
\m
\v 34 And the LORD has given Bezalel and Aholiab, child of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, ability to teach their crafts to other people.
\v 35 The LORD has given to special crafts to them: as carvers, designers, embroiderers with red, blue, and purple thread on fine linen cloth, and weaving. They were expats in all kinds of work and artwork.
