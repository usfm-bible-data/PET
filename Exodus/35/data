\c 35
\s Regulations about the Sabbath day
\p
\v 1 Moses called all of the people of Israel to gather and he said to them, "These are the LORD's orders that have to be done:
\v 2 You will work as long as six days in a week, but you have to rest completely on the seventh day, because that day is the Sabbath day, a day that is holy to the LORD. Whoever works on that day will be sentenced to die.
\v 3 You can't light a fire in your houses on the Sabbath day."
\s Offerings to build the Holy Tent
\p
\v 4 Then Moses said to all of the people of Israel, "This is the LORD's order:
\v 5 Gather offerings for the LORD. May each person whose heart is moved bring an offering to Him—
\li2 that is gold, silver, bronze,
\li2
\v 6 blue, purple and red colored wool cloth, fine linen cloth and goat's hair,
\li2
\v 7 ram's skin colored red, fine leather, acacia wood,
\li2
\v 8 olive oil for lighting, spices to mix into anointing oil and incense,
\li2
\v 9 crysoprase jewels, and other jewels to attach on the ephod and breast cover.
\p
\v 10 May all of the expert craftsmen among you come and make all that was ordered by the LORD— that is
\li2
\v 11 all parts of the Holy Tent, including the tent and its cloth covering, its hooks, its frames, its wooden cross bars, its posts and its bases,
\li2
\v 12 the Chest of Promise with its carrying poles, the chest's cover, and the curtains that cover that chest,
\li2
\v 13 the table with its carrying poles, all of its utensils and the holy serving bread,
\li2
\v 14 the branched lampstand for lighting with its equipment and its lamps, and oil for lighting,
\li2
\v 15 the incense altar with its carrying poles, anointing oil and incense, and the Holy Tent's entrance curtain,
\li2
\v 16 the altar of burned sacrifice with its bronze grill, carrying poles and all of its equipment, the bronze water tank with its base,
\li2
\v 17 curtains for the courtyard, the posts, the courtyard gate door curtain,
\v 18 the bolts for the Holy Tent and the courtyard with their ropes,
\li2
\v 19 the beautiful and holy priest's clothes for Aaron and his children, that they would wear while serving in the Holy Room."
\p
\v 20 Then all of the people of Israel left Moses.
\v 21 After that, every person whose heart was moved and motivated came while bringing offerings for the LORD for the work of the Holy Tent, the worship needs, and priests clothing.
\v 22 Both men and women, all whose hearts were moved brought broches, earrings, rings, necklaces and all kinds of other gold jewelry. They all lifted high their gold as an offering to the LORD.
\v 23 Every person who owned blue, purple and red wool thread, fine linen cloth and goat's hair, ram's skins that were colored red, and fine leather came bringing them.
\v 24 And every person who wanted to offer silver or bronze brought them as an offering to the LORD. In that way also every person who had acacia wood brought them to be used in all of the work.
\p
\v 25-26 Each woman who was skilled at spinning brought the products of their spinning, in the form of blue, purple, and red wool thread. And the women who were skilled in spinning goat's hair brought thread. There also were women who brought fine linen cloth.
\v 27 All of the leaders brought crysoprase jewels and engraved jewels to attach to the ephod and the breast cover,
\v 28 spices and olive oil for lighting, for the anointing oil, and for incense.
\v 29 Both men and women, every Israelite whose hearts were moved brought their offerings willingly to the LORD, to support the work that the LORD ordered through Moses.
\s Bezalel and Aholiab
\p
\v 30 Then Moses said to the Israelites, "The LORD has appointed Bezalel child of Uri, grandson of Hur from the tribe of Judah.
\v 31 The LORD has filled Bezalel with His Spirit and gave him wisdom, skill and ability in all areas of the work—
\v 32 including making designs from gold, silver and bronze,
\v 33 cutting and attaching jewel stones, making wood engravings, along with all types of other crafts.
\v 34 And the LORD has given Bezalel and Aholiab, child of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan, ability to teach their crafts to other people.
\v 35 The LORD has given to special crafts to them: as carvers, designers, embroiderers with blue, purple and red wool thread on fine linen cloth, and weaving. They were expats in all kinds of work and artwork.
