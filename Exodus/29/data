\s1 Orders regarding Aaron and his childrens ordination
\p
\v 1 The LORD said to Moses, "This is what you have to do in the ordination ceremony of Aaron and his children—so that they can serve Me as priests: Take a young male calf and two male sheep whose bodies have no defects.
\v 2 Make three kinds of unleavened bread from the finest wheat flour, that is bread that doesn't contain olive oil, bread that contains olive oil, and thin dry bread that is spread with olive oil after it is baked.
\v 3 Place the bread in a basket, and offer all of it to Me together with the young male calf and the two male sheep.
\p
\v 4 "Then bring Aaron and his children in front of the door of the Holy Tent\f+ fk 29:4 Holy Tent \ft Literally Tent of Meeting, the same thing as is in Ex. 29: 10& 11, Ex. 29:30, 42 &44\f*, and do the ceremony of cleansing to them. In that ceremony you have to wash each of them with water.
\v 5 Then take the clothing— that is the robe, the long robe, the ephod and the breast cover. Put all of them on Aaron, and tie on him the waist sash that is on the ephod.
\v 6 Put the turban on his head and attach the gold medal with the engraving, "Separated especially for the LORD; on that turban.
\v 7 After that anoint him by pouring the oil of anointing on his head.
\v 8 Then order his children to come close and put the robes on them.
\v 9 Attach the waist sash to each of them— that is Aaron and his children— and place the turbans on their heads. That is the statute regarding how to ordain Aaron and his children, so that they and their descendants serve me as priests forever.
\p
\v 10 "After that bring the male calf to the front of the Holy Tent, then order Aaron and his children to place there hands on the head of that male calf.
\v 11 Slaughter the male calf before Me, at that place also.
\v 12 Take some of the male calf's blood, then rub it on the horns of the altar with your finger. The rest of the blood you must pour at the bottom of the altar.
\v 13 After that take all of the fat that covered the stomach contents, liver and two kidneys with their fat. Burn them all on top of the altar as an offering to Me.
\v 14 But the meat, skin and intestines, you have to burn entirely outside the camp. That is the sacrifice to erase sins.
