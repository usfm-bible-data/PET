\s1 Moses sets up the Holy Tent
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 "On the first day of the month, set up My Tent— that is the tent that illustrates My presence among My people.\f + \fr 40:2 \fk symbolizes … \ft Literally, 'Tent of Meeting'. The term 'Tent of Meeting' brings to mind the tent that was raised outside the camp ground as a place to meet with the LORD. (Gen. 33:7-11) But the LORD's Tent that was raised in this chapter functioned as the center of worship for all of the people of Israel. Only the priests and people from the tribe of Levi could enter this LORD's Tent, but sometimes people from another tribe could enter the yard of the LORD's Tent to bring an offering. This Tent of the LORD's was not like a church in this era, where the people of God gather to worship together.\f*
\v 3 Place the Chest of Promise\f + \fr 40:3 \fk Chest of Promise \ft In the Chest of Promise were kept the stone tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments.\f* in side it, in the Most Holy Room. Then hang the curtain dividing the Most Holy Room with the Holy Room.
