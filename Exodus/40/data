\s1 Moses sets up the Holy Tent
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
\v 2 "On the first day of the month, set up My Tent— that is the tent that symbolizes My presence among My people.\f + \fr 40:2 \fk symbolizes … \ft Literally, 'Tent of Meeting'. The term 'Tent of Meeting' brings to mind the tent that was raised outside the camp ground as a place to meet with the LORD. (Gen. 33:7-11) But the LORD's Tent that was raised in this chapter functioned as the center of worship for all of the people of Israel. Only the priests and people from the tribe of Levi could enter this LORD's Tent, but sometimes people from another tribe could enter the yard of the LORD's Tent to bring an offering. This Tent of the LORD's was not like a church in this era, where the people of God gather to worship together.\f*
\v 3 Place the Chest of Promise\f + \fr 40:3 \fk Chest of Promise \ft In the Chest of Promise were kept the stone tablets on which were written the Ten Commandments.\f* inside it, in the Most Holy Room. Then hang the curtain dividing the Most Holy Room with the Holy Room.
\v 4 Bring the table into that tent and arrange all of its utensils. Bring also the lampstand and connect the lamps.
\p
\v 5 "Put the golden altar of incense in front of the Chest of Promise, and connect the curtain in the entrance of the Holy Tent.
\v 6 Place the altar of burned sacrifices in front of the door of the Holy Tent.
\v 7 Place the cleansing vessel between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and fill it with water.
\v 8 Make the courtyard around the outside of the Holy Tent and connect the curtain at the courtyard gate.
\p
\v 9 Then take the anointing oil, and anoint the Holy Tent with all of its utensils inside to set apart all of it for Me, then all of it will become holy.
\v 10 Anoint the altar of burned sacrifices also and all of its utensils to be set apart for Me, so that the altar becomes very holy.
\v 11 Anoint the vessel of cleansing also and its feet to set it apart.
\p
\v 12 "Then bring Aaron and his children to the entrance door of the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.
\v 13 After that, put the holy clothing on Aaron and anoint him so that he is set apart to serve Me as priest.
\v 14 Bring his children too and put the robes on them.
\v 15 Anoint them like you anoint their father so that they can serve Me as priests. By that anointing, they and their descendants are set apart to become priests forever."
\p
\v 16 Then Moses did all of that according to the order of the LORD to him.
\v 17 So the Holy Tent was raised on the first day, the first month in the second year they left Egypt.
\v 18 Moses raised the Holy Tent by putting its foundations, attaching the framework and wooden crossbars, then raising the poles.
\v 19 Then Moses spread out the covering sheets of the tent on top of that framework, according to the LORD's order to him.
\p
\v 20 He took the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments and put them into the chest. Then he attached the carrying pole to the chest and set the chest's cover on top of the chest.
\v 21 Then he brought the chest into the Holy Tent and attached the dividing curtain so that the chest couldn't be seen from outside, according to the LORD's order to him.
\p
\v 22 Then Moses put the table in the Holy Tent to the north side outside of the dividing curtain,
\v 23 and arrange the offering bread on top of the table, according to the LORD's order.
\p
\v 24 Then Moses placed the lampstand in the Holy Tent to the southside in front of that table.
\v 25 He also lit the lamps in front of the LORD, according to the LORD's order to him.
\v 26 Then Moses set the golden altar in front of the curtain in the Holy Tent,
\v 27 and burned the incense there, according to the LORD's command to him.
\p
\v 28 After that, Moses connected the curtain to the entrance door of the Holy Tent.
\v 29 He also put the altar of burned sacrifices on the entrance road to the Holy Tent, and offered burnt sacrifices and grain sacrifices, according to the LORD's order to him.
\p
\v 30 Then Moses put the vessel of cleansing between the Holy Tent and the altar, and filled it with water.
\v 31 Moses, Aaron, and Aaron's children washed their hands and feet there.
\v 32 They had to wash their hands and feet every time they entered the Holy Tent or approached the altar, according to the LORD's order.
\p
\v 33 Then Moses connected the curtains to fence the yard around the Holy Tent along with the altar, and connected the curtain at the courtyard's gate door. In that way, all of the work in raising the Holy Tent was finished.
\s1 The glory of the LORD filled the Holy Tent
\p
\v 34 Then a cloud covered the Holy Tent and the glory of the LORD filled the holy tent.
\v 35 Moses couldn't enter into the Holy Tent because the cloud stayed on top of it, and the glory of the LORD filled the Holy Tent.
\p
\v 36 As long as the people of Israel traveled, every time the cloud lifted from the top of the Holy Tent, the Israelites will(would) continue their journey.
\v 37 However if the cloud didn't lift from the Holy Tent, then they will(would) not leave there.
\v 38 The cloud of the LORD stayed on top of the Holy Tent in the day and became a fire at night so that the cloud could be seen every moment by the Israelites as long as they traveled.
