\v 1 "Call Aaron, your brother along with his children Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. Set them apart especially to serve Me as priests.
\v 2 Make special clothing that is beautiful for Aaron, to show honor and glory as a high priest.
\v 3 You have to order the craftsmen [who are] experts [in their field] whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom to make the clothing for Aaron, [so that//as a sign that] he has been set apart especially to serve Me as priest.
\v 4 The clothing has to be made like this for your older sibling Aaron and his children: a breast cover, ephod, long robe, a long shirt of woven plaid (cloth), a turban, and a waist sash. They have to make special clothing for Aaron, your brother, and for his children for them to wear when they serve Me as priests.
\v 5 Give them gold thread, blue, purple, red and fine linen thread to make those clothes.”
\s The ephod shirt
\p
\v 6 "The expert craftsmen have to make the ephod shirt\f + \fr 28:6 \fk ephod shirt \ft The word 'ephod' is taken directly from the Hebrew language. From the explanation in the book of Exodus, the ephod is thought to be shaped like an apron. Its function is more likely decorative showing several symbols regarding the high priests service.\f* from fine linen cloth that is decorated with gold thread, blue, purple and red wool thread embroidery.
\v 7 The ephod has two parts: that is the front part and the back part. The two parts are connected with two shoulder covers.
\v 8 The waist sash that is attached to the ephod has to be made from the same material as the ephod, that is fine linen cloth which is embroidered with gold thread, and blue, purple and red wool thread.
\p
\v 9 Take two red jewel stones\f + \fr 28:9 \fk jewel stones \ft The type of the jewel stores was carnelian or chrisopraz. See the footnote at verse 20.\f* and engrave on them the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 10 Engrave the names of six children of Jacob on one chrysoprase stone, and six other names on the second stone, according to their order of birth.
\v 11 You have to engrave those names on the stones as a jewelry expert would engrave a seal. Tie the two jewel stones with woven gold thread.
\v 12 Attach the two stones to each of the the ephod shoulder covers as a sign to remind that Aaron represents the twelve tribes of Israel. When Aaron comes before Me bringing their names on both of his shoulders, I will always remember them.
\v 13 Make a gold frame to attach the two stones,
\v 14 and two pure gold chains that have been braided like a rope. Then hook that chain to the gold frame."
\s1 The chest cover
\p
\v 15 "The expert craftsmen have to make the chest cover to be used by the priest to make decisions according to God's will. Make the chest cover with fine linen cloth that is embroidered with gold thread, and blue, purple and red wool thread, like the ephod.
\v 16 The chest cover is folded in half to make a square pocket, with the length and width of 22 centimeters.
\v 17 Attach four rows of jewel stones on that chest cover. The first row will contain pomegranate, chrysolite, and emerald stones.
\v 18 The second row will contain blue mixed with green, dark blue, and clear precious stones.
\v 19 The third row will contain blue, white mixed with brown, and purple precious stones.
\v 20 And the fourth row will contain clear, red, and green mixed with red precious stones. \f + \fr 28:20 \fk precious stones \ft The types of these precious stones are difficult to determine, but can be translated as (v.17) delima, krisolit, zamrud, (18) pirus, safir, berlian, (19) ambar, akik putih, kecubung, (20) krisolit/beril, krisopras, dan yaspis. The color of a few of these stones can be varied, and the type of precious stones are also difficult to determine.\f*Each jewel has to be set on gold frame.
\v 21 Each jewel stone symbolizes one of the tribes of Israel and the name of that tribe is engraved on that jewel stone, like a seal.
\p
\v 22 "Make two chains from pure gold that is braided like rope to tie to the chest cover to the ephod shoulder cover.
\v 23 Make also two gold rings and attach them to the two corners of the chest cover.
\v 24 Then tie the two gold chains to the two gold bracelets on the upper corners of the chest cover.
\v 25 Tie the two other corners of the pure gold chains to the two gold frames on the shoulder cover of the ephod.
\v 26 Then make two other gold rings, and attach them to the two bottom corners of the chest cover, on the inside part that is close ephod.
\v 27 Make two other gold rings and attach them to the bottom part of both of the shoulder cover on the front part, over the seam of the belt.
\p
\v 28 Then tie the rings on the bottom corners of the chest cover with the rings on the ephod above the belt using blue rope so that the chest cover is well attached without displacing.
\p
\v 29 In that way, everytime Aaron enters the Holy Room, he will bring the names of the tribes of Israel on his chest cover. This will continue to remind me of My people.
\v 30 Place the Urim and Thummim\f + \fr 28:30 \fk Urim and Thummim \ft The Urim and Thummim were two objects used by the priests to know God's will. Now we don't know what was there shape or how they were used.\f*— two tools that are used to know My will— in the chest cover. In that way, those things will always be near the heart of Aaron when he come before Me to know My will over the people of Israel.”
\s [Long] Robe
\p
\v 31 "Make the [long] robe for the ephod all of blue colored wool.
\v 32 On the middle of that robe there is a neck hole for Aaron’s head, that is strengthened with woven ribbon so that it isn't easily torn.
\v 33 On the sewn fold (hem?) at the bottom part of the robe, hang decorations shaped like pomegranate fruit\f + \fr 28:33 \fk pomegranate fruit \ft Pomegranate fruit is average sized which is colored red, white or purple. Its many seeds have a long round shape that have almost flattened facets.\f* from blue, purple and red wool thread, and attach gold bells in between them.
\v 34 The gold bells and decorations shaped like pomegranates alternated around the sewn fold.
\v 35 Aaron has to use the robe every time he enters the Holy Room to serve Me, and the bells will sound every time he enters and exits from My presence. If he uses that, he won't die."
\s The turban
\s Serban
\p
\v 36 "Then make a medal from pure gold, and engrave it like engraving a seal with these words: 'Holy for the LORD'.
\v 37 That medal will be attached to the front part of Aaron's turban with blue colored rope.
\v 38 Every time Aaron sacrifices something that the Israelite people give to Me, he must wear this medal on his forehead as a sign that I consider that sacrifice as holy, regardless if mistakes happen in the way the people of Israel give that sacrifice. In that way I will be happ."
\s Other clothing
\p
\v 39 "Make the robe that is woven in a special way for Aaron from fine linen cloth and make the turban also from fine linen cloth and the waist sash, decorated with weaving.
\p
\p
\v 40 "Then for Aaron's children, make robes, waist sashes, and headbands that symbolize their honor and glory as priests.
\v 41 This clothing has to be worn by Aaron and his children, then anoint and ordain them so that (they) become holy so they can so that they may serve as My priests.
\v 42 Make also pants from linen cloth for them, the length of the pants are from the waist to the thigh part.
\v 43 Aaron and his children must wear these clothes when they enter the Holy Tent, or when they approach the altar to serve in the Holy Room, so that they are not punished over this wrongdoing and so die. This will become a statute for them and their descendants.”
