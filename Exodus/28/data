\s The priests' clothing
\p
\v 1 "Call Aaron, your brother along with his children Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. Set them apart especially to serve Me as priests.
\v 2-3 Before Aaron can be ordained to serve Me as the high priest, special, beautiful clothing must be made for him, accrding to his position of honor and glory. Order the expert craftsmen whom I have filled with the spirit of wisdom to make those special clothes.
\v 4 The clothing has to be made like this for your older sibling Aaron and his children: a breast cover, ephod, long robe, a long shirt of woven plaid (cloth), a turban, and a waist sash. All those are to be made for Aaron and his sons for them to wear when they serve Me as priests.
\v 5 The meterial that is needed to make those clothes is gold thread, blue, purple, red and fine linen thread.”
\s2 The ephod shirt and the shoulder coverings
\p
\v 6 "The expert craftsmen have to make the ephod shirt\f + \fr 28:6 \fk ephod shirt \ft The word 'ephod' is taken directly from the Hebrew language. From the explanation in the book of Exodus, the ephod is thought to be shaped like an apron. Its function is more likely decorative showing several symbols regarding the high priests service.\f* from fine linen cloth that is decorated with gold thread, blue, purple and red wool thread embroidery.
\v 7 The ephod has two parts: that is the front part and the back part. The two parts are connected with two shoulder covers.
\v 8 The waist sash that is attached to the ephod will be made from the same material as the ephod, that is fine linen cloth which is embroidered with gold thread, and blue, purple and red wool thread.
\p
\v 9 Take two red jewel stones\f + \fr 28:9 \fk jewel stones \ft The type of the jewel stores was carnelian or chrisopraz. See the footnote at verse 17.\f* and engrave on them the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 10 Engrave the names of six children of Jacob on one chrysoprase stone, and six other names on the second stone, according to their order of birth.
\v 11-14 The way to engrave those names on the two stones is like a jewelry expert would engrave a seal. The two jems will be attached to a gold setting and sewn to the shoulder covers, as a sign to remind that Aaron represents the twelve tribes of Israel. When Aaron comes before Me bringing their names on both of his shoulders, I will always be reminded that Aaron represents all of My people. The two gold settings also will be attached to the chest covering with two gold chains that have been braided like a rope.”
\s2 The chest cover
\p
\v 15 “The expert craftsmen have to make the chest cover to be used by the priest to make decisions according to My will.\x + \xo 28:15 \xt Gen. 28:30\x* The chest cover will be made from fine linen cloth that is embroidered with gold thread, and blue, purple, and red wool thread, like the ephod.
\v 16 The chest cover is folded in half to make a square pocket, with the length and width of 22 centimeters.
\v 17 Attach four rows of jewel stones on that chest cover. The first row will contain jewels of red, clear, and dark green.\f + \fr 28:20 \fk precious stones \ft The types of these precious stones are difficult to determine, but can be translated as (v.17) delima, krisolit, zamrud, (18) pirus, safir, berlian, (19) ambar, akik putih, kecubung, (20) krisolit/beril, krisopras, dan yaspis. The color of a few of these stones can be varied, and the type of precious stones are also difficult to determine.\f*
\v 18 The second row will contain blue mixed with green, dark blue, and clear precious stones.
\v 19 The third row will contain blue, white mixed with brown, and purple precious stones.
\v 20 And the fourth row will contain clear, red, and green mixed with red precious stones. Each jewel has to be set on gold frame.
\v 21 The twelve jewels symbolize the twelve sons of Israel, which later became the twelve tribes of Israel. Each jewel will be engraved, like the engraving on a seal, each jewel with one name of Israel’s tribes.
\p
\v 22-25 “Two chains from pure gold that is braided like rope with two gold rings are needed as a holder to the top of the upper part of the chest cover. One ring will be sewn to the upper left corner, and another one sewn to the upper right corner of the chest cover, in order to tie the chest cover with the chains to the two gold settings on the efod’s shoulder coverings.
\v 26-28 Four other gold rings also need toebe made, which will hold the chest chover from below. One ring will be sewn to the lower left corner of the chest cover, and one on the lower right corner, on the inside which is near the ephod. Two gold rings will be sewn to the front part of the ephod, to the left and right, and in between the lower end of the shoulder cover and the seam of the belt. The two rings on the left and the two on the right will be joined with blue cord, so that the chest cover does not just hang from the top only when Aaron bends over.
\v 27 Make two other gold rings and attach them to the bottom part of both of the shoulder cover on the front part, over the seam of the belt.
\p
\v 28 Then tie the rings on the bottom corners of the chest cover with the rings on the ephod above the belt using blue rope so that the chest cover is well attached without displacing.
\p
\v 29 Every time Aaron enters the Holy Room, he will always wear that chest cover. In that way he will always carry the names of the tribes of Israel above his heart, and I will always be reminded that Aaron represents all of My people.
\v 30 Place the Urim and Thummim\f + \fr 28:30 \fk Urim and Thummim \ft The Urim and Thummim were two objects used by the priests to know God's will. Now we don't know what was there shape or how they were used.\f*— two tools that are used to know My will— in the chest cover. In that way, those things will always be near the heart of Aaron when he come before Me to know My will over the people of Israel.”
\s2 The blue robe
\p
\v 31 "Make the [long] robe for the ephod all of blue colored wool.
\v 32 On the middle of that robe there is a neck hole for Aaron’s head, that is strengthened with woven ribbon so that it isn't easily torn.
\v 33 On the sewn fold (hem?) at the bottom part of the robe, hang decorations shaped like pomegranate fruit\f + \fr 28:33 \fk pomegranate fruit \ft Pomegranate fruit is average sized which is colored red, white or purple. Its many seeds have a long round shape that have almost flattened facets.\f* from blue, purple and red wool thread, and attach gold bells in between them.
\v 34 The gold bells and decorations shaped like pomegranates alternated around the sewn fold.
\v 35 Aaron has to use the robe every time he enters the Holy Room to serve Me, and the bells will sound every time he enters and exits from My presence. If he uses that, he won't die."
\s2 The medal for the turban
\p
\v 36 “Then make a medal from pure gold, and engrave it like engraving a seal with these words: 'Holy for the LORD'.
\v 37 That medal will be attached to the front part of Aaron's turban with blue colored rope.
\v 38 Every time Aaron sacrifices something that the Israelite people give to Me, he must wear this medal on his forehead as a sign that I consider that sacrifice as holy, regardless of whether mistakes happen in the way the people of Israel give the sacrifice. In that way I will be favorable toward my people."
\s2 Other clothing made from linen
\p
\v 39 "Make the robe that is woven in a special way for Aaron from fine linen cloth and make the turban also from fine linen cloth and the waist sash, decorated with weaving.
\p
\p
\v 40 "Then for Aaron's children, make robes, waist sashes, and headbands that symbolize their honor and glory as priests.
\v 41 This clothing has to be worn by Aaron and his children, then anoint and ordain them so that (they) become holy so they can so that they may serve as My priests.
\v 42 Make also pants from linen cloth for them, the length of the pants are from the waist to the thigh part.
\v 43 Aaron and his children must wear these clothes when they enter the My tent, or when they approach the altar to serve in the Holy Room, so that they are not punished over this wrongdoing and so die. This will become a statute for them and their descendants.”
