\s1 God’s Ten Commandments
\p
\v 1 Then God said:
\li1
\v 2 “I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out from slavery in Egypt.
\li1
\v 3 Don’t worship fake gods. Worship Me only.
\li1
\v 4 Don’t make idols for you to imitate/look like anything in the sky, or on earth, or in water.
\v 5 Don’t bow down or worship to idols, because I, the LORD your God, is a jealous God.\f + \fr 20:5 \fk jealous \ft What is meant by jealousy here is not the negative jealous character like in humans, but a character that [is moved by God’s love//God moves by His love].\f*Whoever goes against Me— by worshipping fake gods— I will punish until his third and fourth generation.
\v 6 But to the people who love Me and who obey My commands, I will heap My steadfast love over his family— until thousdands of generations.
\li1
\v 7 Don’t misuse\f + \fr 20:7 \fk misuse My name See footnote on Deu. 5:11\f*My name, the LORD your God. I will punish everyone who misuse my Name.\f + \fr 20:7 \fk misuse My name \ft An example of misusing the LORD’s name in the Old Testament is to strengthen a witness about a matter by saying, “My the LORD punish me if I lie.” If a person says that, if he actually lie, he deserves to be punished by the LORD for two sins: to lie and to misusing the LORD’s name. Another example is to promise to do something by saying, “Let the LORD punish me if I don’t do this.” If after that the person who said so do not keep his promise, he has misused the LORD’s name. Another example is when using the LORD’s name in the context that is not honoring to Him, like when angry at other people.\f*
\li1
\v 8 Remember to guard the holiness of Sabbath day by obeying commands about the Sabbath day.
\v 9 Six day long you will work and do you daily activities,
\v 10 but on the seventh— that is the Sabbath day— is the day where you stop all work to honor Me, the LORD your God. On that day no one may do any work— whether you, or your children, your servants, your livestocks, and sojourners that come with you.
\v 11 I, the LORD, already created the sky, earth, sea, and all that is in it for six days, and rest on the seventh. For that reason I bless the Sabbath day and sanctify it.
\li1
\v 12 Honor your father and mother that you will live long, and your strivings/business will go well in the land that I— the LORD your God, give to you.
\li1
\v 13 Don’t kill anyone.
\li1
\v 14 Don’t do adultery.
\li1
\v 15 Don’t steal.
\li1
\v 16 Don’t lie when you witness in court.
\li1
\v 17 Don’t want other’s possessions— including his wife, his house, his male servants, his female servants, his cow, or his donkey.”

\p
\v 18 When people hear thunder and a loud trumpet sound and see lightning and mountain covered with smoke, they tremble in fear and stood at a distance.
\p
\v 19 Then they said to Moses, “Tell us what the LORD says to you and we will listen. But don’t let the LORD speak directly to us, because we will die!”
\p
\v 20 Moses said to them, “Don’t be afraid, because the LORD comes to test you so you are afraid and honor Him so that you will not sin again.”
\p
\v 21 While the people stood at a distance, Moses approached the thick and dark cloud where God was.
\s1 Rule about the offering altar
\p
\v 22 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the people of Israel: You yourselves have seen how I talked with you from the sky.”
\v 23 Don’t make other gods, whether from silver or gold.
\p
\v 24 “Make an altar from soil for Me, and offer your flow and your sheep on it as a burnt sacrifice and also peace sacrifice. I will come and bless you in every place where I make My name honored.
\v 25 If you make an altar of stone for Me, don’t use stones that can be chiselled. If you chisel it with equipment, you will desecrate/make dirty that altar.
\v 26 Don’t go up the stairs to My altar, so that your nakedness is not visible.”
