\v 18 When people hear thunder and a loud trumpet sound and see lightning and mountain covered with smoke, they tremble in fear and stood at a distance.
\p
\v 19 Then they said to Moses, “Tell us what the LORD says to you and we will listen. But don’t let the LORD speak directly to us, because we will die!”

\s1 Rule about the offering altar
\p
\v 22 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the people of Israel: You yourselves have seen how I talked with you from heaven.”
\v 23 Don’t make other gods, whether from silver or gold.
\p
\v 24 “Make an altar from soil for Me, and offer your flow and your sheep on it as a burnt sacrifice and also peace sacrifice. I will come and bless you in every place where I make My name honored.
\v 25 If you make an altar of stone for Me, don’t use stones that can be chiselled. If you chisel it with equipment, you will desecrate/make dirty that altar.
\v 26 Don’t go up the stairs to My altar, so that your nakedness is not visible.”
