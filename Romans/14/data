\c 14
\s Don’t criticize other brothers in the faith
\p
\v 1 Willingly accept people who do not completely believe in the conviction about the freedom we who have become one with Christ have. Don’t waste time debating opinions with them.
\v 2 For there are brothers and sisters of ours who are strong in their faith in Christ, who feel they have permission from God to eat all kinds of food. But there are also other brothers and sisters who doubt, who feel they’re permitted by God to eat vegetables only.
\v 3 Those who are certain that you may eat all kinds of food must not think they are better than those who eat only vegetables. The same is true for those of you who have convictions to eat only vegetables, don’t consider those who eat all kinds of food to be wrong. For God has accepted those brothers and sisters in the faith without making an issue of their convictions about food.
\v 4 For example, you don’t have the right to judge another person’s servant. Only his master has the right to determine if that servant is wrong or right. Consider this, we’re owned by the Lord! He’s certainly able to support us so that we won’t fall!
\p
\v 5 And there are brothers of ours who are sure that one day is more important than another day. But there are also other brothers and sisters who are sure that everyday is equally important. In situations like that, everyone should decide for himself according to his own convictions.
\v 6 For the brothers and sisters who celebrate certain days do it for the Lord’s glory.\f + \fr 14:6 \fk difference in copies \ft There are copies in the Greek language that add words like these, “And our brothers and sisters who consider everyday to be the same, also do that for the Lord’s glory.”\f* Our Brothers and sisters who feel that they can eat all kinds of food eat to glorify the Lord and are thankful to God for that food. And those who don’t eat some kinds of foods also do it to glorify the Lord, and they’re also thankful to God for it.
\p
\v 7 Not one of us live or die for ourselves alone.
\v 8 If we live, we live to glorify the Lord. And if we die, we die to glorify the Lord also. So whether we live or die, we do everything to glorify the Lord because we’re the Lord’s possessions.
\v 9 For that’s why Christ died and was brought back to life from death, so that He might become Lord over everyone, both those who are still living and those who’ve died.
\p
\v 10 So let’s not criticize each other as brothers in the faith! We don’t have the right to do that, and let’s not consider ourselves to be better than our other brothers and sisters in the faith. For we’ll all stand before God, and He’s the one who’ll judge us.
\v 11 For it’s written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “The Lord says,
\q2 ‘I swear by Myself as the living God
\q1 that everyone will kneel down in worship before Me,
\q2 and everyone will confess that I am God.’”\x + \xo 14:11 \xt Is. 45:23\x*
\m
\v 12 Each of us will be accountable to God for all our deeds.
\s Don’t cause other people to sin
\p
\v 13 We should stop criticizing each other, and let’s decide not to do things that make our brother become weak or fall into sin anymore.
\v 14 Let me share my opinion as a person who’s one with the Lord Jesus. I’m certain that there’s no food that's forbidden for us. But for a person who’s convinced that a certain kind of food is forbidden, if he eats that forbidden food, he does wrong.
\p
\v 15 If you know that your brother in the faith considers some food forbidden yet he sees you still eating that food, then you’re destroying that brother’s faith and you aren’t truly showing love. So don’t shatter the confidence of your brother in the faith just because of a problem with food. Remember that Christ died for that brother of yours too.
\v 16 Don’t let something that you consider to be good become something that’s viewed as evil by another brother of ours.
\v 17 Food and drinks aren’t important things for us as citizens of God’s kingdom. But what’s important is living right before God, being at peace and rejoicing in the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 For everyone who serves Christ in that way will certainly please God. And they’ll be well-accepted by other people too.
\p
\v 19 So let’s diligently try to do what brings peace among us and what builds up everyone’s spirit.
\v 20 Don’t let the problem of food destroy the work of God in the life of your brother or sister in the faith, for all food is permitted. But we do wrong if we eat something in front of a person who considers that food forbidden. If he also eats that food, he has fallen into sin.
\v 21 It’s better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything at all if it causes your brother or sister to fall into sin.
\p
\v 22 Keep your opinion about those kinds of things to yourself so just you and God know it. The person who does what he’s convinced is right before God so that he doesn’t feel accused is very happy.
\v 23 But if you eat something and you aren’t sure that it’s permitted, then you do wrong because you didn’t do what you were convicted to do. For whoever goes against what he is convicted is right before God has sinned.
