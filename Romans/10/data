\c 10
\p
\v 1 My Brothers and sisters, the longing of my heart and my sincere request to God is that all of the Jews will be saved.
\v 2 I truly know that the Jews sincerely try to live to please God’s heart, but their efforts aren’t based on correct understanding.
\v 3 For they don’t understand how God makes people righteous, so they try in their own way, not in God’s way. And because of that they don’t want to obey and follow the way God determined.
\v 4 They don’t understand that Christ has fulfilled all of the rules in the Law for us. So everyone who fully believes in Jesus is made right before God, without relying on those rules any more.
\p
\v 5 Moses wrote about the way to be made right by obeying the rules of the Law, “The person who is considered to be righteous before God has to follow all of the rules of this Law.”\x + \xo 10:5 \xt Lev. 18:5\x*
\v 6-7 Because of that, it would be best for us to wholeheartedly obey what is also written about people who are made right by God because they believe in Him, which is, “You don’t need to go up to the highest sky and go down to the deepest foundation of the earth anymore.” The meaning of that Word of the Lord is: You no longer need to seek the way to heaven in order to bring Christ down to the world so that He can help you. And you don’t need to go down to the world of the dead to bring Christ up here. For Christ is already near us.
\p
\v 8 So the new way to be saved that we are sharing isn’t difficult! It’s also like what is stated in the Holy Bible, “The true message from God is already near you, in your mouth and in your heart.”\x + \xo 10:8 \xt Deut. 30:12-14\x*
\v 9 And this is God’s message, if you admit with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and fully believe in your heart that God has brought Jesus back to life from among dead people, then you will be saved.
\v 10 It’s like this, if we fully believe like that in our hearts, then we are made right in God’s sight. So we clearly admit with our mouths that we follow Jesus, then we are saved.
\v 11 For in the Holy Bible it’s written, “Everyone who believes in Him won’t be disappointed.”\x + \xo 10:11 \xt Is. 28:16\x*
\v 12 God’s statement is valid for everyone, both for Jews and for people who aren’t Jews. For there is only one God for everyone, and He abundantly blesses everyone who asks for His help.
\v 13 For God’s Word also says, “Everyone who cries out to the Lord asking for his help will be saved.”\x + \xo 10:13 \xt Joel 2:32\x*
\p
\v 14 But how can people ask for His help if they don’t yet believe in Him? And how can people believe in Him if they haven’t yet heard about Him? And how can people hear about Him if there isn’t anyone to tell them about Him?
\v 15 And how can we tell them about Him if we aren’t sent? As it’s written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “The coming\f + \fr 10:15 \fk coming \ft Literally, “feet.”\f* the feet of the people who are sent to tell the Good News are so beautiful.” \x + \xo 10:15 \xt Is. 52:7\x*
\p
\v 16-17 So people become believers because they hear the news that is told to them. And they hear that news because there is a person who tells about Christ. But not everyone is ready to receive the Good News from God, especially the Jews. That’s why the Prophet Isaiah complained to God, “Lord, hardly anyone believes the news that You ordered me to tell.”\x + \xo 10:16-17 \xt Is. 53:1\x*
\p
\v 18 But now, can they say that they haven't had the opportunity yet to hear the Good News? Actually they can't, because the news about Christ has been widely spread, as it's written in Psalms, \f + \fr 10:18 \fk Paul's purpose \ft This verse is translated according to the interpretation that Paul is still speaking about the Jewish people. (That is seen from what Paul quotes from Isaiah 53:1 in verse 16.) Apparently Paul is quoting a phrase from Psalm 19 just to illustrate that the Gospel has been widely spread, even to every place where the Jewish people live. That means that Paul was using this phrase mentioned with a different meaning than the first writer, King David, meant.\f*
\q1 “The sun, the moon, and all of the stars tell
\q2 the news about the Lord in everyplace."\x + \xo 10:18 \xt Ps. 19:5\x*
\m
\v 19 But I’m asking again: Why is it that the people of Israel can’t seem to understand the Good News? First, we need to remember that God had said through Moses,
\q1 “I will make you jealous
\q2 when I bless other people groups whom you consider to be useless.
\q1 And I will use people groups who didn’t know Me in the past
\q2 as a tool to make you angry.”\x + \xo 10:19 \xt Deut. 32:21\x*
\m
\v 20 Then the Prophet Isaiah boldly delivered these words of God,
\q1 “People groups that didn’t seek Me in the past
\q2 will find Me.
\q1 And I will reveal Myself to people
\q2 who don’t know Me.”\x + \xo 10:20 \xt Is. 65:1\x*
\m
\v 21 But God says about the people of Israel,
\q1 “I’ve held out My hand too long and waited for them to return to Me,
\q2 but they keep hardening their hearts and don’t want to obey Me.”\x + \xo 10:21 \xt Is. 65:2\x*
