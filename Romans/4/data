\s Abraham's example
\p
\v 1 So what can we say about Abraham, who is the forefather of those of us who come from the Jewish people?
\v 2 If Abraham became right before God because of the good things he did, he had reason to brag that he was better than other people. But Abraham can’t brag before God like that.
\v 3 For this is what the Holy Bible says about him:
\q1 “Abraham believed God’s promise, and because of that he was accepted by God as a righteous man.”\x + \xo 4:3 \xt Gen. 15:6\x*
\p
\v 4 Take note! If a person does work for his master, the wages given aren’t considered to be a gift, but a right that must be given.
\v 5 But if a person doesn’t rely on the results of his own efforts and just fully believes in God’s promise, the blessing that he receives is considered to be a gift. And that’s true for us! God forgives each of us for our evil deeds without a requirement. Then God accepts us as people who live right.
\v 6 King David felt a blessing like that too, and wrote about God's blessing, which a person can receive without God paying attention to good deeds done by that person. David said,
\q1
\v 7 “The person whose transgressions and sins are forgiven is truly blessed by God!
\q2
\v 8 The person whose sins are no longer counted is truly blessed by God!”\x + \xo 4:8 \xt Ps. 32:1-2\x*
\p
\v 9 Is that blessing just for the Jews, the people who are circumcised? Or does it also include people from other people groups? It’s clear that Abraham fully believed God’s promise, and that's why he was accepted by God as a person whose life was right.
\v 10 When did that happen? Before or after he was circumcised? Yes, it happened before he was circumcised.
\v 11 Abraham was accepted by God as a righteous person, and then he was circumcised as a sign that he was accepted by God. In that way, it’s clear that Abraham is the father of everyone who believes, even if uncircumcised. Through fully believing in God’s promise, they are also accepted by God as right-living people.
\v 12 And Abraham is also the father of circumcised people. But it is not because of that circumcision that Abraham became their father. He becomes their father only if they believe like Abraham believed, before he was circumcised.
\s We receive God’s promise through believing
\p
\v 13 God promised to give this world to Abraham and to his descendants. Notice that God’s promise wasn’t because Abraham obeyed the Law. Abraham received that blessing because he fully believed God’s promise, and then he was accepted by God as a person whose life was right.
\v 14 If only people who keep the Law are blessed by God, that means that God’s promise to Abraham was just empty talk. It also means that it’s useless for us to believe like Abraham believed.
\v 15 The Law can’t bring a blessing, but can only cause God’s wrath when we break it. But if there was no Law at the time of Abraham, it means no regulation was broken.
\p
\v 16 So the key to being made right in God’s eyes is to fully believe! People who fully believe in Him will receive the blessings from God’s promise just like Abraham did. God arranged it so that righteousness according to the promise is a gift which is freely given. And if the promise is a gift, it means that everyone included as Abraham’s descendants will definitely receive it. The promise isn’t just for his descendants who live according to the Law, but it is also for the descendants who fully believe like he did. So in God’s sight, spiritually speaking, Abraham is the ancestor of us all.
\v 17 That agrees with what’s written in the Holy Bible about Abraham, “I will make you the father of many people groups.” Abraham believed those words of God's because he knew that God is the one who gives life to the dead.  And he believed that by His words alone, God brought into existence things that had never been.\x + \xo 4:17 \xt Gen. 17:5\x*
\p
\v 18 At that time, there was no hope for Abraham to have a child. But Abraham kept hoping in God and believing in that promise. That’s what made him the father of many people groups, just as God had told him, “Your descendants will be so many.”\x + \xo 4:18 \xt Gen. 15:5\x*
\v 19 At that time, Abraham was aware that he was almost a hundred years old and was too old to become a father. And Sarah couldn’t have children anymore either. Even so, he didn’t doubt God’s promise at all.
\v 20 Abraham wasn’t half-hearted when he believed that God could do what He had promised him. He had decided to honor God, so he believed more and more
\v 21 until he felt fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised.
\v 22 So because of that, Abraham “was accepted by God as a person whose life was right.”\x + \xo 4:22 \xt Gen. 5:6\x*
\v 23 The words “accepted as a person whose life was right” weren’t just written about Abraham.
\v 24 Those words are also about us who’ve been accepted by God as people whose lives are right, that is we, in this age, who believe fully in God who has brought our Lord Jesus back to life from death.
\v 25 Jesus was offered up to die by crucifixion because of our offenses and has been brought back to life from death so that we can be made right before God.
