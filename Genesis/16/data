\c 16
\s1 Abram had a son from Hagar
\p
\v 1 Until then, Sarai had not yet given [any] offspring/descendants for Abram. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar.
\v 2 So Sarai said to Abram, “Until now the LORD has not yet allowed me to become pregnant. If you agree, I will give my slave Hagar to have intercourse with you. Maybe she can become pregnant and give you the offspring/descendant that we would later consider to be a child that I bore.” And Abram agreed with Sarai's suggestion.
\v 3 Then Sarai handed Hagar over to Abram to be made a wife with slave status. This happened after they had settled in Canaan for ten years.
\p
\v 4 Abram had intercourse [lit.: be-of-one-body] with Hagar, and Hagar became pregnant. When Hagar knew that she was pregnant, she considered Sarai, her master, inferior.
\v 5 Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are the one who is wrong in this matter! I already gave my slave to have intercourse with you. But ever since she learned that she was pregnant, she has belittled/slighted and insulted me! All of this is your fault! Let the LORD be the one who will punish you!”
\p
\v 6 Abram replied to Sarai, “All right! Hagar is your slave, and you have full authority over her. So treat her as you wish!” Then Sarai began to treat Hagar cruelly, so that Hagar ran away from Sarai.
\p
\v 7 But the LORD sent an angel to meet Hagar in the wilderness, near the spring located on the side of the road leading to Sur.
\v 8 The LORD spoke through the angel to her, “Hagar, Sarai's slave, where have you come from and where are you going?”
\p Hagar replied, “I am running away from my master, Sarai.”
\p
\v 9-10 Then the angel delivered the LORD's message, “Return to your master and do what she commands you. I will give you very many offspring, so that no one can count them!
\v 11 Hear! You are pregnant and will give birth to a son. Name him Ishmael, \f + fr 16:11 \fk Ishmael \ft The name Ishmael means ‘God hears’ or ‘May God hear’.\f* because the Lord has heard your mourning.
\v 12 But your child will [like to//often] oppose others, like a wild donkey. He will oppose everyone and they will reject him. He will live far from his relatives.”
\p
\v 13 Because the angel conveyed the LORD’s message to her, she asked in her heart, “[Is it true that I have//Have I really] seen the God who paying attention to me?!” So after that Hagar often referred to the LORD as “He who pays attention to me.”
\v 14 That is why the spring was named ‘Beer Lahai Roi’.\f + \fr 16:14 \fk Beer Lahai Roi \ft The name of the spring means ‘the well of the LORD who lives, who watches me’.\f* Until now\f + \fr 16:14 \fk Until now \ft For something spoken of in the Bible as ‘still there until right now’, the meaning is ‘still there until when that book was written’.\f* the spring is still there. It is located between Kades and Bered.
\p
\v 15-16 The time came when Hagar gave birth to a baby boy who was given the name Ishmael. At that time, Abram was 86 years old.
