\c 16
\s1 Abram had a son from Hagar
\p
\v 1 Until then, Sarai— Abram's wife, had not yet given [any] offspring/descendants to Abram. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.
\v 2 Therefore Sarai said to Abram, “Until now the LORD has not allowed me to conceive. If you agree, I will give my servant Hagar to have sex with you. Maybe she can conceive and give off the offspring/descendant that we would later consider to be my child.” And Abram agreed with Sarai's proposal.
\v 3 Then Sarai handed Hagar over to Abram to be made an-inferior-status-wife. This happened after they had settled in Canaan for ten years.
\p
\v 4 Abram had intercourse [lit.: be-of-one-body] with Hagar, and Hagar became pregnant. When Hagar knew that she was pregnant, she considered her employer inferior— Sarai.
\v 5 Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are wrong in this matter! I gave my servant to have intercourse with you. But ever since she learned that she was pregnant, she has belittled/slighted and insulted me! All of this is your fault! Let the LORD punish you!”
\p
\v 6 Abram replied to Sarai, “All right, Hagar is your servant, and you have full authority over her. So treat her the way you want!” Then Sarai began to treat Hagar cruelly, so that Hagar ran away from Sarai.
\p
\v 7 But the angel of the LORD found Hagar in the wilderness, near the spring which is on the side of the road leading to Sur.
\v 8 The angel said to her, “Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from and where are you going?”
\p Hagar replied, “I am running away from my mistress, Sarai.”
\p
\v 9-10 Then the angel delivered the LORD's message, “Return to your employer and do what he has commanded you. I will give you very many offspring, so that no one can count them!
\v 11 Hear! You are pregnant and will give birth to a son. Name him Ishmael, \f + fr 16:11 \fk Ismael \ft The name Ishmael means, ‘God hears’, or, ‘May God hear’.\f* because the Lord has heard your crying/weeping.
\v 12 But your child will [like to//often] oppose others— comparable to a wild donkey. He will oppose everyone and they will reject him. He will live far from his relatives.”
\p
\v 13 Because the angel conveyed the message of the Lord to her, she asked herself, “[Is it true that I have//Have I really] seen God who is watching me?!” So after that Hagar often referred to God as, “He who notices/watches me.”
\v 14 That is why the well is called ‘the well of the LORD who lives, who watches me’.\f + \fr 16.14 \fk the name of the well \ft In Hebrew the name is called ‘Beer Lahai Roi’.\f * Until now the well is still there. It is located between Kades and Bered.
\p
\v 15-16 The time when Hagar gave birth to a baby boy who was given the name Ishmael. At that time, Abram was 86 years old.
