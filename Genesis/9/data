\c 9
\s1 God made a covenant with Noah
\p
\v 1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth!
\v 2 All the animals of the earth, the birds of the air, the crawling things, the creeping creatures, and the fishes of the sea will be very afraid of you.\f + \fr 9:2 \fk very afraid … \ft Hebrew writes the two words ‘\ft fear’\ft and ‘\ft dread’\ft . This is a language style in Hebrew, where two words with almost the same meaning are used to make the meaning more intensive.\f* I give over all of them as your possessions and responsibilities.
\v 3 Just as I gave you earlier all the green plants to your food, so now I give you every species of animal and bird as your food.
\v 4 Only you must not eat meat that still has the blood of the butchered animal, because the blood always symbolizes that I give life to each of those creatures.\f + \fr 9:4 \fk blood always symbolizes … \ft This phrase can be translated more literally as, “meat with its life blood.” See Lev. 17:10-14.\f*
\p
\v 5 Therefore, I will pronounce judgement on every person or animal that kills a human.
\q1
\v 6 Because mankind was created to reflect the qualities of me,
\q`1 therefore whomever kills a human,
\q2 may he die at the hand of a human as well.
\p
\v 7 Again I say to you, Be fruitful and multiply, so that your offspring fill the whole earth.”
\p
\v 8 God said to Noah and his sons,
\v 9 “Listen carefully! Now I make a covenant with you and also to your descendants,
\v 10 and to every living creature that is with you on the ship— including birds, cattle, and wild animals.
\v 11 I promise that I will never destroy all living creatures that live on the earth with a flood.”
\p
\v 12-13 Then God said to them, “I will fulfill my previously mentioned covenant to all living beings, including you and your descendants for ever. As a sign of my covenant, I will place my rainbow in the sky.
\v 14 When I bring rain from the clouds, then a rainbow will appear in the sky,
\v 15 and I will remember the covenant I made with you and all the living creatures, that I will no longer bring a flood to destroy all living creatures.
\v 16 Whenever I see the rainbow appearing in the sky, I will remember the covenant I made with all the living creatures on the earth. That covenant will be in force forever.
\v 17 And the rainbow is a sign of my covenant that I have made with all the living creatures on the earth. "
\s1 The sons of Noah
\p
\v 18-19 The sons of Noah who came out of the ship were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. These three sons of Noah became the ancestors of all the [nations/ethnic groups] of the world. Ham is the father of Canaan. (And later on, the descendants of Canaan were called the Canaanite nation.)
\p
\v 20 Noah became a farmer and made a vineyard.
\v 21 One day he drank too much wine until he (became) drunk. Then he lay naked in his tent.
\v 22 When Ham (the father of Canaan) saw that Noah (his own father) was within lying naked, he went out and told his two older brothers about it.
\v 23 Then Shem and Japheth took a robe to cover their father's body. But so that they did not see their father's nakedness, the cloak was first laid by them by placing their ends on each of their backs, then they went backwards into the tent. Thus they covered Noah with the robe.
\p
\v 24 When Noah realized that he was drunk and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
\v 25 He said,
\q1 “Because of Ham's wrong-doing, let the race of Canaan be cursed.\f + \fr 9:25 \fk Because of Ham's wrong-doing … \ft There are several interpretations as to why even though the one doing the wrong was Ham, the one cursed was his youngest son. Some say that Canaan represents all the descendants of Ham. This problem really can't be answered. What is clear, Noah's curse appears to be a prophecy, because in later days the nation of Canaan became the enemies of the nation of Israel.\f*
\q2 Let them be the lowest slaves for the descendants of Shem and Japheth.
\q1
\v 26 Praise the Lord, the God worshiped by Shem!
\q2 Let Ham's descendants be his slaves.
\q1
\v 27 May the Lord add to blessings to Japheth by expanding his region.
\q2 Let his descendants live in harmony with the sons of Shem,
\q2 and let Canaan's descendants be Japheth's slaves also.”
\p
\v 28 After the flood, Noah lived for another 350 years.
\v 29 Then he died at the age of 950 years old.
