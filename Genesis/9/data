\c 9
\s1 God made a covenant with Noah
\p
\v 1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful and fill the earth!
\v 2 All the beasts of the earth, the birds of the air, the crawling things, the creeping creatures, and the fishes of the sea will be very afraid of you.\f + \fr 9:2 \fk very afraid \ft Hebrew writes ‘umowraakem’ (fear) and ‘wehittekem’ (dread). This is a language style in Hebrew, where two words with almost the same meaning are used to make the meaning more intensive.\f* I give over all of them as your possessions and responsibilities.
\v 3 Just as I gave you earlier all the green plants to your food, so now I give you every species of animal and bird as your food.
\v 4 Only you must not eat meat that still has the blood of the butchered animal, because the blood always symbolizes that I give life to each of those creatures.
\p
\v 5 Likewise also the blood of every man must be regarded as holy. Therefore, I will punish every person or animal that kills a human.
\q1
\v 6 Yes, whoever kills a human,
\q2 he will die at the hand of a human as well.
\q1 Because mankind was created
\q2 of similar appearance with me.
\p
\v 7 Again I say to you, Be fruitful, so that your offspring fill the whole earth.”
\p
\v 8 God said to Noah and his sons,
\v 9 “Listen carefully! Now I sincerely promise to you and also to your descendants,
\v 10 and to every living creature that is with you on the ship— including birds, cattle, and wild beasts.
\v 11 I sincerely promise that I will never destroy all living creatures that live on the earth with a flood.”
\p
\v 12 Then God said to them, “This is the sign of the promise that I (will) fulfill my covenant with all living beings— including you and your descendants for ever.
\v 13 I will place a rainbow in the sky as a sign of my covenant/promise with you and everything on earth.
\v 14 When I bring rain from the clouds, then a rainbow will appear in the sky,
\v 15 and I will remember the covenant I made with you and all the living creatures, that I will no longer bring a flood to destroy all living creatures.
\v 16 Whenever I see the rainbow appearing in the sky, I will remember the covenant I made with all the living creatures on the earth. That covenant/promise is forever.
\v 17 And the rainbow is a sign of my covenant with all the living creatures on the earth. "
\s1 About the sons of Noah
\p
\v 18-19 The sons of Noah who came out of the ship were Shem, Japheth, and Ham. These three sons of Noah became the ancestors of all the [nations/ethnic groups] of the world. Ham is the father of Canaan. (And later on, the descendants of Canaan were called the Canaanites nation.)
\p
\v 20 Noah was the first man to become a farmer and the first one to make a vineyard.
\v 21 One day he drank too much wine until he (became) drunk. Then he lay naked in his tent.
\v 22 When Ham (the father of Canaan) saw that his father was within lying naked, he went out and told his two older brothers about it.
\v 23 Then Shem and Japheth took a robe to cover their father's body. But so that they did not see their father's nakedness, the cloak was first laid by them by placing their ends on each of their backs, then they went backwards into the tent. Thus they covered Noah with the robe.
\p
\v 24 When Noah realized that he was drunk and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
\v 25 He said,
\q1 “Cursed be Canaan, the son of Ham.
\q2 Let them be the lowest slaves of their brothers.
\q1
\v 26 May the Lord whom I worship bless Shem,
\q2 and let Ham's descendants be his slaves.
\q1
\v 27 May the Lord add to blessings to Japheth by expanding his [region//dwelling place].
\q2 Let his descendants live in harmony with the sons of Shem,
\q2 and let Canaan's descendants be Japheth's slave also.”
\p
\v 28 After the flood, Noah lived for another 350 years.
\v 29 And when he died, he was 950 years old.
