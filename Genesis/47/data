\s Joseph's Wise Arrangements
\p
\v 1 Then Joseph went to face the King of Egypt to report, “Your Honor, my father along with my brothers have arrived in Goshen from the land of Canaan. They have brought their herds of livestock and all their possessions.”
\p
\v 2 Joseph also brought five of his older siblings to face the king.
\v 3 The king just answered, “What is your livelihood?”
\p They just answered, “Like our forefathers, we shepherd livestock.”
\v 4 They continued, “Our land is hit by a draught disaster so we had trouble in caring for our herds of livestock. Because of that, if Your Honor is pleased, we request that we be able to care for our herds of livestock here and live temporarily in Goshen.”
\p
\v 5 The king said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
\v 6 The land of Egypt lies before you. Goshen is the best region in this land, let your father and brothers live there. If there are among them who are smart at shepherding, give them the work of managing my livestock.”
\p
\v 7 Joseph then brought his father before the king, and Jacob blessed the king.
\v 8 The king then said to Jacob, “How old are you?”
\p
\v 9 Jacob answered, “Your servant has gone through life full of trouble as a wanderer for one hundred and thirty years. That is very short compared with my forefathers’ lives as wanderers.”
\v 10 Before taking leave, Jacob expressed parting blessings.
\p
\v 11 So Joseph helped his father and brothers to settle in the best land in the land in Egypt, in the land of Rameses, as the king commanded.
\v 12 Joseph gave enough food supplies to his father, his brothers along with all of their relatives to the very youngest.
\s1 Joseph's leadership at the time of the famine in Egypt
\p
\v 13 The famine disaster grew worse. There was no food anywhere, so that the people in all the land of Egypt and even Canaan were in famine.
\v 14 Joseph gathered all of the money from all of the residents of Egypt and Canaan for food supplies that they bought. Then Joseph brought that money to the king.
\v 15 When the money of the Egyptian citizens and Canaanites was used up, the Egyptians said to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Our money is gone. Do we have to die in front of you?”
\p
\v 16 Joseph responded to them by saying, “If you all really don't have money, give your livestock as payment.”
\v 17 Then they just brought their livestock to Joseph, in exchange as payment, and Joseph gave them food supplies. There were those who brought horses, donkeys, goats and sheep. Joseph just gave them food supplies in exchange. That applied for the length of that year.
\p
\v 18 In the following year, the people returned before Joseph, “We cannot hide it anymore from Master that our money is gone, and all of our animals that we own have become Master's possessions. There is nothing left which we can trade for food except our land and our bodies!
\v 19 Do we have to perish in front of you, both ourselves and our land? Take our land and ourselves as payment for food supplies, because we really don't own anything anymore. Let us become the king's slaves and our land become his! Give us seed to plant, so that we can stay alive and not perish and our land won't become barren!”
\p
\v 20 So Joseph just bought all of the land in Egypt for the king. The field owners were forced to sell their fields because the famine was so severe. All of the fields became the possession of the king of Egypt.
\v 21 Then all the people from one edge of the border of Egypt to the other edge of the border became slaves.
\v 22 Except the land owned by their religion's priests. The ministers didn't have to sell land because the king gave food rations to them.
\p
\v 23 Joseph said to the people, “Pay attention, because I have bought you and also your fields for the king, so plant these seeds!
\v 24 At the next harvest, you all have to give one fifth (20%) to the king, and the remaining four fifths (80%) is your own to become seed, for your own food supplies, including all who live in one house and little children who are your responsibility.”
\p
\v 25 The people answered, “You Sir have saved our lives! May we be pleasing before our Master. We will just become the king's slaves.”
\v 26 So Joseph made it a law until now that is still valid in Egypt, that one fifth (20%) of all the harvested produce is owned by the king of Egypt. Only the land owned by the priests wasn't owned by the king.
\p
\v 27 The Israelites lived in the region of Goshen. They owned land there and their lives were successful and their number increased.
\v 28 Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years. He lived as long as 147 years.
\v 29 When Jacob was already dying, he called for Joseph and said, “If you truly love me, place your hand between my thighs\x + \xo 47:29 \xt Kej. 24:2\x* to show your faithfulness to hold the promise to not bury me in Egypt.
\v 30 I want to be buried together with my forefthers. So take me out of Egypt and bury me with them.”
\p Joseph answered, “I will do what father requests.”
\p
\v 31 Jacob said, “Promise that you will do it.” So Joseph just promised. Then Jacob bowed and gave thanks to the LORD at the head of his bed.
