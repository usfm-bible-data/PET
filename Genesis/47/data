\s The king gives permission for Jacob’s group to live in Goshen
\p
\v 1 Then Joseph went to face the King of Egypt to report, “Sir, my father along with my brothers have arrived from the land of Canaan. They have brought their herds of livestock and all their possessions. Now they are in Goshen.”
\p
\v 2 Joseph also brought five of his older siblings to face the king.
\v 3 The king even asked, “What is your livelihood?”
\p They just answered, “Like our forefathers, we shepherd livestock.”
\v 4 They continued, “The land of Canaan is experiencing a draught disaster, so we had trouble in caring for our herds of livestock. Because of that, if you are pleased, we request permission to be able to care for our herds of livestock here and stay temporarily in Goshen.”
\p
\v 5 The king said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
\v 6 The land of Egypt lies before you. Goshen is the best region in this land, let your father and brothers live there. If there are among them who are smart at shepherding, give them the work of managing my livestock.”
\p
\v 7 Then Joseph brought his father before the king, and Jacob blessed the king.
\v 8 The king asked Jacob, “How old are you?”
\p
\v 9 Jacob answered, “Your servant has gone through life full of trouble as a wanderer for one hundred and thirty years. That is very short compared with my forefathers’ lives as wanderers.”
\v 10 Before taking leave, Jacob expressed a parting blessing to the king.
\p
\v 11 After that Joseph helped his father and brothers to settle in the best land in the land in Egypt, in the region of the city of Rameses,\f + \fr 47:11 \fk Rameses \ft The city of Rameses was built in the time of Moses in the region of Goshen, located at the delta of the Nile river. See the footnote at Gen. 45:10.\f* according to the king’s commanded.
\v 12 Joseph gave enough food supplies to his father, his brothers along with all of their relatives to the very youngest.
\s1 The way Joseph led at the time of the famine in Egypt
\p
\v 13 The famine disaster grew worse. There was no food anywhere, so that the people in all the land of Egypt and even Canaan were suffering because of that big famine.
\v 14 Joseph gathered all of the money from all of the residents of Egypt and Canaan via the food supplies that they bought. Then Joseph brought that money to the king.
\v 15 When the money of the Egyptian citizens and Canaanites was used up, the Egyptians said to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Our money is gone. Do we have to die in front of you?”
\p
\v 16 Joseph answered, “If you all really don't have money, give your livestock as payment.”
\v 17 Then they just brought their livestock to Joseph in exchange as payment, and Joseph gave them food supplies. There were those who brought horses, donkeys, cows, goats, and sheep. Joseph just gave them food supplies in exchange. That applied for the length of that year.
\p
\v 18 In the following year, the people returned before Joseph and said, “We cannot hide it anymore from Master that our money is gone, and all of our animals that we own have become Master's possessions. There is nothing left which we can sell for food, except our land. Or we are forced to sell ourselves as slaves!
\v 19 Must we perish in front of you, both ourselves and our land? Take our land and ourselves as payment for food supplies, because we don't own anything anymore. Let us become the king's slaves and our land become his! Give us seed to plant, so that we can stay alive and not perish, and so our land won't become barren!”
\p
\v 20 So Joseph just bought all of the land in Egypt for the king. The field owners were forced to sell their fields because the famine disaster was so severe. All of the fields became the possession of the king of Egypt.
\v 21 Then all the citizens— from one edge of the border of Egypt to the other edge of the border— became slaves.\f + \fr 47:21 \fk textual difference \ft Like many translations, TSI follows the Septuagint in this verse. The Masoretic Text says, “Then concerning the citizens, Joseph moved them to the cities of Egypt, from one end to the other end.”\f*
\v 22 Except the land owned by their religion's priests. The ministers didn't have to sell land because the king gave food rations to them.
\p
\v 23 Joseph said to the people, “Pay attention, because I have bought you and also your fields for the king, so plant these seeds!
\v 24 At the next harvest, you all have to give twenty percent to the king, and the eighty percent is your own to become seed, for your own food supplies, including all who live in one house and little children who are your responsibility.”
\p
\v 25 The people answered, “You Sir have saved our lives! May we be pleasing before you/Sir. We will just become the king's slaves.”
\v 26 So Joseph made that a law that to the present is still valid in Egypt, namely that twenty percent of all the harvested produce is the property of the king. Only the land owned by the priests didn’t become the property of the king.
\p
\v 27 The Israelites lived in the region of Goshen. They owned land there and their lives were successful. Their number continually increased.
\v 28 Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years, until his age reached 147 years.
\v 29 When Jacob was already dying, he called for Joseph and said, “If you truly love me, place your hand between my thighs\x + \xo 47:29 \xt Gen. 24:2\x* to show your faithfulness to hold the promise to not bury me in Egypt.
\v 30 I want to be buried together with my forefthers. So take me out of Egypt and bury me with them.”
\p Joseph answered, “I will do what father requests.”
\p
\v 31 Jacob said, “Promise that you will do it.” So Joseph just promised. Then Jacob bowed and gave thanks to the LORD at the head of his bed.
