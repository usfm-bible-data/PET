\s Abraham sought a future wife for his son Isak
\p
\v 1 Abraham was very old and the Lord had blessed him in all things.
\v 2 One day he said to his most senior servant in his house\f + \fr 24:2 \fk senior … \ft The term in Hebrew זָקֵן (zaqen) can be connected to age— that is the oldest, or someone who has seniority because his is faithful and his work is very good so that he is considered most trustworthy, or both.\f*— who held responsibility for all his property, saying, “Put your hand between my thighs.\f + \fr 24:2 \fk between my thighs \ft This way of making an oath is only told about two times in the Bible, which is here and Gen. 47:29. This custom can be explained that the senior servant put his hand between Abraham's (his master's) thighs and near his genitals. An oath like this shows that the action promised in the oath is something that is very important and personal especially for the person requesting the oath, like Abraham [requests] of his servant.\f*
\v 3 Swear by the Lord, the God who created the heavens and the earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son Isaac from among the Canaanites.
\v 4 But you must go to my birth country— that is to my relatives, and choose a woman from there to be the wife of my son Isak.”
\p
\v 5 Then the servant said, “If the woman does not want to come with me to this country, do I have to come back to you and take your son Isak back there?”
\p
\v 6 But Abraham answered him, “No! Don't ever take my child back to that country!
\v 7 The LORD, the God of the heavens, who brought me from my father's house and from my birthplace, who said and swore to me that He will give this land to my descendants, He will send His angels to help you, so that you may find a wife for my child.
\v 8 But if the girl doesn't want to come with you, then you are free from this vow. What is clear, don't take my child back there.”
\p
\v 9 Then the servant put his hand under Abraham's thigh and swore that he would do what Abraham asked.
\s Rebekah became Isak's wife
\p
\v 10 Then the servant and several other servants of Abraham took ten camels belonging to Abraham with all kinds of wealth, then left for the city in the northern region of Syria, \f + \fr 24:10 \fk the city in the northern region of Syria \ft Literally, 'Aram-Naharaim'. This name means Aram in the Middle of Two Rivers.\f* where Nahor (Abraham's brother) lived.
\v 11 After arriving there, he ordered the camels to kneel near a well outside the city. It was late afternoon and the time had come for the women in the city to come to the well to draw out water.
\p
\v 12 The the servant prayed, saying, “Lord, God, my lord Abraham, I ask you to show your kindness to my master Abraham by making me succeed in getting a wife for his son Isak today.
\v 13 I am currently near a water well. Soon the daughters of the city residents will come out to draw water.
\v 14 I ask you, let it happen like this: When I say to one of them, ‘Please lower your bucket and give me a drink,’ and if she says, ‘Drink, and let me give drink to your camels too,’ then may it be she who the Lord has choosen for your servant Isaac. In that way I will know that You are keeping the promise that You have given to my master Abraham.”
\p
\v 15 When he was still praying like that, Rebekah— the child of Betuel, the granddaughter of Nahor from his wife Milka, came out of the city with a bucket for water on her shoulder.
\v 16 Rebekah was very beautiful and still an (unmarried) girl. She went down to the well and filled her bucket, then came up again.
\v 17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Child, please give me a little drink from your bucket.”
\p
\v 18 Then the girl replied, “Go ahead!” Then he quickly lowered her bucket and gave the servant a drink.
\v 19 After that she said added, “Let me draw water also for your camels, Sir, until all of them drink until (they are) satisfied.”
\v 20 Then she quickly poured the water in her bucket into the drinking place for the camels. Then she ran again to the well to draw more water, until all those animals drank until they were satisfied.\f + \fr 24:20 \fk drank until they were satisfied \ft A camel that has not drunk for several days, can drink as much as 50 liters of water. Abraham's servant had 10 camels. So the work that Rebecca did to dip water until all those camels were satisfied was not a light task.\f*
\p
\v 21 Abraham's servant quietly watched Rebekah, while wondering in his heart if this woman was the one that the Lord would give as an answer to his prayer.
\v 22 When all the camels had satisfied their thirst, the servant took a gold ring for a nose weighing six grams and two gold bracelets which each weighed about a hundred and ten grams. He gave all that to Rebekah as a present
\v 23 while saying, “Whose child are you? Is there a place for us to stay at your house?”
\p
\v 24 Rebekah answered him, “My father is named Betuel. I am the granddaughter of Nahor and Milka.
\v 25 In our house there is a place for you to stay overnight. We also have lots of straw and also food for the camels.”
\p
\v 26 Then the servant bowed down and praised the Lord
\v 27 and said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has been kind and faithful to my lord! He has led me to directly to my master's relatives!”
\p
\v 28 Then Rebekah ran to his mother's house and told her everything that had happened.
\v 29-30 Rebekah had a brother named Laban. After hearing Rebecca's explanation of what Abraham's servant had said, and also seeing the jewelry on the nose and the bracelet on his sister's arm, he ran out to meet Abraham's servant who was still near the well
\v 31 He said, “Hey, you who are blessed by the Lord! Why are you standing outside?! Come, I have provided a lodging for you in our house and a place for your camels.”
\p
\v 32 So Abraham's servant went to the house of Bethuel's family. Bethuel's servants lowered the burdens from the camels and gave them food. They also lined the stalls with straw as a bed for the camels. Nahor's other servants provided water for the senior servant and all the servants of Abraham with him to clean their feet.
\v 33 But when food was readied before them, Abraham's servant did not want to directly eat. He said to Bethuel and Laban, “I do not want to eat before conveying the reason for my coming.”
\p Then Laban said, “If so, tell us.”
\p
\v 34 So the servant began to tell him, “I am Abraham's servant.
\v 35 The Lord has blessed my master, and he has become a lavishly rich man. The Lord has given him many goats, sheep, oxen, camels, donkeys, silver and gold, male and female slaves.
\p
\v 36 And Sarah (the wife of my master) in her very old age, has given birth to a son for my master Abraham. And now, all the wealth of my master has been handed over to that son of his.
\v 37 My master made me swear to obey his commands. He said to me, ‘Do not seek a wife for my son Issac from among the Canaanites here,
\v 38 but you must go to the land of my birth— that is to my relatives, and take an (unmarried) girl from there to be my wife Issac.’
\p
\v 39 Then I asked him, ‘What about if that woman doesn't want to come with me to this country?’
\v 40 He said to me, ‘The Lord before whom I was obediant all my life me will send his angel to help you and make your journey successful to find a wife for my son Issac from my own people, from my relatives.
\v 41 But if my own people do not allow the woman whom you have met to return home with you to here, then you will be free from your oath to me.’
\p
\v 42 And when I came to the well, I prayed in my heart, ‘LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, make my trip successful today.
\v 43 Now I am near the well. When a girl came to draw water, and I ask her to give me a drink,
\v 44 And if she gives it and even is willing to give water to my camels, then let it be a sign that she is the woman whom the LORD has chosen to be the wife for Issac, the son of my master.’
\p
\v 45 While I was praying in my heart, Rebekah came with a bucket on her shoulder. She went down to the well and drew up water. Then I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’
\v 46 And she quickly lowered the bucket on her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink. I will also give water for your camels.’ Then I drank, and she gave water to the camels.
\p
\v 47 Then I asked, ‘Who is your father?’ And he answered, ‘My father is Bethuel, the son of Nahor and from his wife Milcah.’ Then I put a ring on her nose and a pair of bracelets on her arms.
\p
\v 48 Then I bowed down and praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, for He brought me directly here this place— to the relatives of my master Abraham, so that I might find this girl for the son of my master.
\v 49 So now, please let me know if you are willing to show kindness to my master, so that I can know what I must do.”
\p
\v 50 Laban and Bethuel said to him, “This is clearly from the Lord. So we both certainly agree.
\v 51 Here is Rebekah! Bring her to be the wife of the son of your master— as the LORD has decided.”
\p
\v 52 When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed down and praised the LORD.
\v 53 Then he brought out gold, silver and fine clothing, and gave it to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to Rebekah's mother and brother.
\v 54 Then he and the servants who were with him ate and drank together. And that night they stayed there.
\p When he got up the next morning he said, “Let us go back to our master Abraham.”
\p
\v 55 But Rebekah's brother and mother said, “Let Rebecca stay with us for about ten more days.”
\p
\v 56 He said to them, “The LORD has made my journey successful. So please do not make me stay any longer. Now let us go home to my master Abraham.”
\p
\v 57 They said to him, “Good/Well. If so let's ask Rebekah's opinion.”
\v 58 So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Do you want to go with this man?”
\p Rebekah replied, “Yes, I want to.”
\p
\v 59 So they allowed Rebekah and the woman who had taken care of her since childhood/little to go with Abraham's servant and the other servants of Abraham.
\v 60 And before leaving, they blessed Rebekah and said,
\q2 “Our sister, may the LORD give you thousands and even millions of children,
\q2 and let them rule over the ciries of their enemies.”
\p
\v 61 So Rebekah rose up with the young women who were her slaves, and they each went on camels and followed Abraham's servant.
\p
\v 62 Now Isaac had recently returned to his home at Negeb from the area of the well of Lahai-Roi.\f + \fr 24:62 \ft See the meaning of Lahai-Roi in Kej. 16: 14 \f*
\v 63 One afternoon, when he had left the encampment to be alone and was walking in the field, he saw camels coming from afar.
\v 64 When Rebekah saw Isaac, she got down from her camel
\v 65 and asked Abraham's servant, “Who is that man in the field who is walking toward us?”
\p Then the servant replied, “He is my master.” So Rebekah took her veil and covered her face.\f + \fr 24:65 \fk veil … \ft In the customs of that time, every bride must wear a [head covering/cador]. So when Rebecca covered her face with a veil, she was showing respect to her bride groom, and simultaneously showing that she was ready to marry Isaac.\f*
\v 66 The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.
\p
\v 67 So Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother's tent, Sarah, and took her as his wife. Isak very much loved Rebekah. In that way his heart was comforted after his mother's death.
