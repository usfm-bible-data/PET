\s Abraham sought a future wife for his son Isak
\p
\v 1 Abraham was very old and the Lord had blessed him in all things.
\v 2 One day he said to his most senior servant in his house\f + \fr 24:2 \fk senior … \ft The term in Hebrew זָקֵן (zaqen) can be connected to age— that is the oldest, or someone who has seniority because his is faithful and his work is very good so that he is considered most trustworthy, or both.\f*— who held responsibility for all his property, saying, “Put your hand under my thigh.
\v 3 Swear by the Lord, the God who created the heavens and the earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son Isaac from among the Canaanites.
\v 4 But you have to go to my birth country - that is to my relatives, and choose a woman from there to be the wife of my son Isak.”
\p
\v 5 Then the servant said, "If the woman does not want to come with me to this country, do I have to go back to you and bring your son Isak back there?"
\p
\v 6 But Abraham answered him, "No! Don't ever bring my child back to that country!
\v 7 The LORD, the God of the heavens — who brought me from my father's house and from my birthplace, who said and swore to me that He will give this land to my descendants, He will send His angels to help you, so that you may find a wife for my child.
\v 8 But if the girl doesn't want to come with you, then you are free from this vow. What is clear, you don't bring my child back there. "
\p
\v 9 Then the servant put his hand under Abraham's groin and swore that he would do what Abraham asked.
\s Rebekah became Isak's wife
\p
\v 10 Then the servant and several other servants of Abraham took ten camels belonging to Abraham with all kinds of wealth, then left for the city in the northern region of Syria, \f + \fr 24:10
\for cities in the northern part of Syria \ft Literally, 'Aram-Naharaim'. This name means Aramaic in the Middle of Two Rivers, where Nahor - Abraham's brother, lives.
\v 11 After arriving there, he ordered the camels to kneel near a well outside the city. It was late afternoon and the time had come for the women in the city to come to the water draw well.
\p
\v 12 Then pray the servant, he said, "Lord, God, my lord Abraham, I beg you to show your kindness to my master Abraham by making me succeed in getting a wife for his son Isak today.
\v 13 I am currently near a water well. Soon the daughters of the city residents will come out to draw water.
\v 14 I beg you, let it happen like this: When I said to one of them, 'Please lower your bucket and give me a drink,' And if he said, "Drink, and let me give drink to your camels too," Then it is he who the Lord chooses for thy servant Isaac. Thus I will know that You are keeping the covenant that You have given to my master Abraham. "
\p
\v 15 When he was still praying, Rebekah — the son of Betuel, the grandson of Nahor from his wife Milka, came out of the city with a bucket of water on his shoulder.
\v 16 Rebekah was very beautiful and still a girl. He went down to the well and filled his bucket, then went up again.
\v 17 Then the servant ran to meet him and said, "Son, please give me a little drink from your bucket."
\p
\v 18 Then the girl replied, "Please!" Then he immediately lowered his bucket and gave the servant a drink.
\v 19 After that he said again, "Let me draw water also for your camels, until everyone drinks with satisfaction."
\v 20 Then he immediately poured the water in his bucket into the camel's drink. Then he ran again to the well to draw more water, until all the animals drank with satisfaction.
\p
\v 21 Abraham's servant looked at Rebekah secretly, wondering in his heart that this woman was what the Lord would give as an answer to his prayer.
\v 22 When all the camels drank with satisfaction, the servant took a gold ring for a nose weighing six grams and two gold rings, each of which weighed about a hundred and ten grams. He gave everything to Rebekah as a present
\v 23 while saying, "Whose child are you? Is there a place for us to stay at your house? "
\p
\v 24 Rebekah answered him, "My father is named Betuel. I am the grandson of Nahor and Milka.
\v 25 In our house there is a place for you to stay overnight. We also have lots of straw and also food for the camels. "
