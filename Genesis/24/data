\s Abraham sought a future wife for his son Isak
\p
\v 1 Abraham was very old and the Lord had blessed him in all things.
\v 2 One day he said to his most senior servant in his house\f + \fr 24:2 \fk senior … \ft The term in Hebrew זָקֵן (zaqen) can be connected to age— that is the oldest, or someone who has seniority because his is faithful and his work is very good so that he is considered most trustworthy, or both.\f*— who held responsibility for all his property, saying, “Put your hand under my thigh.
\v 3 Swear by the Lord, the God who created the heavens and the earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son Isaac from among the Canaanites.
\v 4 But you must go to my birth country— that is to my relatives, and choose a woman from there to be the wife of my son Isak.”
\p
\v 5 Then the servant said, “If the woman does not want to come with me to this country, do I have to come back to you and take your son Isak back there?”
\p
\v 6 But Abraham answered him, “No! Don't ever take my child back to that country!
\v 7 The LORD, the God of the heavens, who brought me from my father's house and from my birthplace, who said and swore to me that He will give this land to my descendants, He will send His angels to help you, so that you may find a wife for my child.
\v 8 But if the girl doesn't want to come with you, then you are free from this vow. What is clear, don't take my child back there.”
\p
\v 9 Then the servant put his hand under Abraham's thigh and swore that he would do what Abraham asked.
\s Rebekah became Isak's wife
\p
\v 10 Then the servant and several other servants of Abraham took ten camels belonging to Abraham with all kinds of wealth, then left for the city in the northern region of Syria, \f + \fr 24:10 \fk the city in the northern region of Syria \ft Literally, 'Aram-Naharaim'. This name means Aram in the Middle of Two Rivers.\f* where Nahor (Abraham's brother) lived.
\v 11 After arriving there, he ordered the camels to kneel near a well outside the city. It was late afternoon and the time had come for the women in the city to come to the well to draw out water.
\p
\v 12 The the servant prayed, saying, “Lord, God, my lord Abraham, I ask you to show your kindness to my master Abraham by making me succeed in getting a wife for his son Isak today.
\v 13 I am currently near a water well. Soon the daughters of the city residents will come out to draw water.
\v 14 I ask you, let it happen like this: When I say to one of them, ‘Please lower your bucket and give me a drink,’ and if she says, ‘Drink, and let me give drink to your camels too,’ then may it be she who the Lord has choosen for your servant Isaac. In that way I will know that You are keeping the promise that You have given to my master Abraham.”
\p
\v 15 When he was still praying like that, Rebekah— the child of Betuel, the granddaughter of Nahor from his wife Milka, came out of the city with a bucket for water on her shoulder.
\v 16 Rebekah was very beautiful and still an (unmarried) girl. She went down to the well and filled her bucket, then came up again.
\v 17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Child, please give me a little drink from your bucket.”
\p
\v 18 Then the girl replied, “Go ahead!” Then he quickly lowered her bucket and gave the servant a drink.
\v 19 After that she said added, “Let me draw water also for your camels, Sir, until all of them drink until (they are) satisfied.”
\v 20 Then she quickly poured the water in her bucket into the drinking place for the camels. Then she ran again to the well to draw more water, until all those animals drank until they were satisfied.
\p
\v 21 Abraham's servant quietly watched Rebekah, while wondering in his heart if this woman was the one that the Lord would give as an answer to his prayer.
\v 22 When all the camels had satisfied their thirst, the servant took a gold ring for a nose weighing six grams and two gold bracelets which each weighed about a hundred and ten grams. He gave all that to Rebekah as a present
\v 23 while saying, “Whose child are you? Is there a place for us to stay at your house?”
\p
\v 24 Rebekah answered him, “My father is named Betuel. I am the granddaughter of Nahor and Milka.
\v 25 In our house there is a place for you to stay overnight. We also have lots of straw and also food for the camels.”
\p
\v 26 Then the servant bowed down and praised the Lord
\v 27 and said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has been kind and faithful to my lord. He has led me to the house of my master's brother.”
\p
\v 28 She ran to his mother's house and told her everything.
\v 29-30 Rebekah had a brother named Laban. After hearing Rebecca's explanation of what Abraham's servant said, and also seeing the jewelry on the nose and the bracelet on her sister's arm, she ran out to meet Abraham's servant who was still near the well
\v 31 He said, "You are blessed by the Lord! Why are you standing outside? Come, I have provided a lodging for you in my house and a place for your camels. "
\p
\v 32 So Abraham's servant went to Laban's house. Laban's servants lowered the burden of the camels and gave them food. They also floated the cage with straw as a bed for the camels. Laban's other servants provided water for the senior servant and all the servants of Abraham with him to clear their feet.
\v 33 But when they had been ready to eat, Abraham's servant refused to eat. He told Laban, "I do not want to eat before delivering my destination."
\p Then Laban said, "Tell me then."
\p
\v 34 So the servant began to tell him, "I am Abraham's servant.
\v 35 The Lord has blessed my lord, and he has become a rich man. The Lord has given him many goats, sheep, oxen, camels, donkeys, silver and gold, male and female servants.
\p
\v 36 And Sarah, your wife, in her old age, has given birth to a son to my master Abraham. And now, all your possessions have been handed over to her son.
\v 37 My master made me swear to obey his commands. He said to me, 'Do not seek a wife for my son Issach from among the Canaanites,
\v 38 But you must go to my homeland to my relatives, and take a girl from there to be my wife Issach. '
\p
\v 39 So I asked her, 'How can she not go with me to this land?'
\v 40 He said to me, 'The Lord who is before me will send his angel to help you and make your journey to find a wife for my son Issach of my own people, from my relatives.
\v 41 But if my own people do not allow the women whom you have met to go home with you, you will be free from your oath. '
\p
\v 42 And when I came to the well, I prayed in my heart, 'Lord, God of my master Abraham, if you will, make me prosper today.
\v 43 Now I was near the well. When a girl came to draw water, I asked her to give me a drink,
\v 44 And if she gives me water to my camels, then let it be a sign that she is the woman whom the Lord has chosen to be your wife Issah my son. '
\p
\v 45 While I was praying in my heart, Rebekah came with a bucket on her shoulders. He goes down to the well and draws water. Then I said to him, 'Please give me a drink.'
\v 46 So he quickly lowered the bucket on his shoulder and said, 'Drink. I will also give you water for your camels. 'Then I drank, and she drank the camels.
