\s Abraham sought a future wife for his son Isaac
\p
\v 1 Abraham was very old and the LORD had blessed him in all things.
\v 2 One day he said to his most senior servant,\f + \fr 24:2 \fk most senior \ft The word in Hebrew translated as ‘most senior’ can be connected to age, that is the oldest. Or the word can be understood as the one who has seniority because of his being faithful and his work is very good, so that he is considered most trustworthy. And both things could be true of the servant mentioned.\f* who held responsibility for all his property. He said, “Put your hand between my thighs.\f + \fr 24:2 \fk between my thighs \ft This way of making an oath is only mentioned two times in the Bible, namely on this verse and Gen. 47:29. This custom can be explained that the senior servant put his hand between Abraham's (his master's) thighs and near his genitals. An oath like this shows that the action promised in the oath is something that is very important and personal especially for the person requesting the oath.\f*
\v 3 Swear by the LORD, the ruler over the sky and the earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son Isaac from among these Canaanites.
\v 4 But you must go to my birth country— that is to my relatives, and choose a woman from there to be the wife of my son Isaac.”
\p
\v 5 Then the servant said, “If the woman does not want to come with me to this country, do I have to come back to you and take your son Isaac back there?”
\p
\v 6 But Abraham answered him, “No! Don't ever take my child back to that country!
\v 7 The LORD, the God over the sky (heavens), who brought me from my father's house and from my birthplace, who said and swore to me that He will give this land to my descendants, He will send His angel to help you, so that you can find a wife for my child.
\v 8 But if the girl doesn't want to come with you, then you are free from this vow. What is clear, don't take my child back there.”
\p
\v 9 Then the servant put his hand under Abraham's thigh and swore that he would do what Abraham asked.
\s Rebekah became Isaac's wife
\p
\v 10 Then the servant and several other slaves of Abraham loaded all kinds of wealth on ten camels belonging to Abraham, then left for the city of Aram-Naharaim\f + \fr 24:10 \fk Aram-Naharaim … \ft ‘Aram-Naharaim’ means ‘Aram in the Middle of Two Rivers’. The location of it is in the northern part of Mesopotamia, which now is known as Iraq.\f* where Nahor (Abraham's brother) lived.
\v 11 After arriving there, he ordered to make the camels kneel near a well outside the city. It was late afternoon and the time had come for the women in the city to come to the well to draw out water.
\p
\v 12 The the servant prayed, saying, “O LORD, God of my master Abraham, I ask you to show Your kindness to my master Abraham by making me succeed in getting a wife for his son Isaac today.
\v 13 I am currently near a water well. Soon the daughters of the city residents will come out to draw water.
\v 14 I ask you, let it happen like this: When I say to one of them, ‘Please give me a drink,’ and if she says, ‘Drink, and let me give drink to your camels too,’ then may it be her who the LORD has choosen for your servant Isaac. In that way I will know that You are showing Your kindness to my master Abraham.”
\p
\v 15 When he was still praying like that, Rebekah— the child of Betuel, the grandchild of Nahor and his wife Milcah, came out of the city with a bucket for water on her shoulder.
\v 16 Rebekah was very beautiful and still an (unmarried) girl. She went down to the well and filled her bucket, then came up again.
\v 17 Then Abraham's servant ran to meet her and said, “Child, please give me a little drink from your bucket.”
\p
\v 18 Then the girl replied, “Drink, Sir!” Then she quickly lowered her bucket and gave the servant a drink.
\v 19 After that she said again, “Let me draw water also for your camels, Sir, until all of them drink until (they are) satisfied.”
\v 20 Then she quickly poured the water in her bucket into the drinking place for the camels. Then she ran again to the well to draw more water, until all those animals drank until they were satisfied.\f + \fr 24:20 \fk drank until they were satisfied \ft A camel that has not drunk for several days, can drink as much as 50 liters of water. Abraham's servant had 10 camels. So the work that Rebecca did to draw water until all those camels were satisfied was not a light task.\f*
\p
\v 21 Abraham's servant quietly observed Rebekah, while wondering in his heart if this woman was the one that the LORD would give as an answer to his prayer.
\v 22 When all the camels had satisfied their thirst, the servant took a gold ring for a nose weighing six grams and two gold bracelets which each weighed about 110 grams. He gave all that to Rebekah as a present
\v 23 while saying, “Whose child are you? Is there a place for us to stay at your family's house?”
\p
\v 24 Rebekah answered him, “My father is named Betuel. My grandfather’s name is Nahor and my grandmother’s name is Milcah.
\v 25 In our house there is a place to stay overnight. We also have lots of straw and also food for your camels.”
\p
\v 26 Then the servant bowed down worshipping the LORD
\v 27 and said, “Praised be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has been kind and faithful to my master! He has led me to directly to my master's relatives!”
\p
\v 28 Then Rebekah ran to her mother's house and told her everything that had happened.
\v 29-30 Rebekah had a brother named Laban. After hearing Rebecca's explanation of what Abraham's servant had said, and also because of seeing the jewelry on the nose and the bracelet on his sister's arm, he ran out to meet Abraham's servant who was still beside the camels near the well.
\v 31 Then he said, “Hey, you who are blessed by the LORD. Why are you standing outside?! Come, I have provided a lodging for you in our house and a place for your camels.”
\p
\v 32 So Abraham's servant entered the house of Bethuel's family. Bethuel's slaves lowered the burdens from the camels and gave them all food. They also lined the stalls with straw as a bed for the camels. Bethuel's other slaves provided water for the senior servant and all the slaves of Abraham with him to clean their feet.
\v 33 But when food was ready to be served before them, Abraham's servant did not want to directly eat. He said to Bethuel and Laban, “I do not want to eat before conveying the purpose for my coming.”
\p Then Laban said, “If so, tell us.”
\p
\v 34 So the servant began to tell him, “I am Abraham's servant.
\v 35 The LORD has blessed my master, so that he has become a lavishly rich man. The LORD has given him many goats, sheep, cows, camels, donkeys, silver and gold, and also male and female slaves.
\p
\v 36 And Sarah (the wife of my master) in her very old age, has given birth to a son for my master Abraham. And now, all the wealth of my master has been handed over to that son of his.
\v 37 My master made me swear to obey his commands. He said to me, ‘Do not seek a wife for my son Isaac from among the Canaanites here,
\v 38 but you must go to the land of my birth— that is to my relatives, and take an (unmarried) girl from there to be wife for my son Issac.’
\p
\v 39 Then I asked him, ‘What if that woman doesn't want to come with me to this country?’
\v 40 He said to me, ‘The LORD before whom I have been obedient all my life me will send His angel to help you and make your journey successful to find a wife for my son Issac from my own people, — that is, from my relatives.
\v 41 But if my own people do not allow the woman whom you have met to return home with you to here, then you will be free from your oath to me.’
\p
\v 42 And when earlier I came to the well I prayed in my heart, ‘O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if You will, make my trip successful today.
\v 43 Now I am near the well. If a girl came to draw water, then I ask her to give me a drink,
\v 44 and if she gives it and even is willing to give water to my camels, then let it be the sign that she is the woman whom the LORD has chosen to be the wife for Isaac, the son of my master.’
\p
\v 45 While I was praying in my heart, Rebekah came with a bucket on her shoulder. She went down to the well and drew up water. Then I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’
\v 46 And she quickly lowered the bucket on her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink. I will also give water for your camels.’ Then I drank, and she gave water to the camels.
\p
\v 47 Then I asked, ‘Whose child are you?’ And he answered, ‘My father is named Bethuel. My grandfather is named Nahor and my grandmother is named Milcah.’ Then I put a ring on her nose and a pair of bracelets on her arms.
\p
\v 48 Then I bowed down and praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, for He brought me directly here to this place— to the relatives of my master Abraham, so that I might find this girl for the son of my master.
\v 49 So now, please let me know if you are willing to show kindness to my master, so that I can know what I must do.”
\p
\v 50 Laban and Bethuel said to him, “This clearly comes from the Lord. So we both certainly agree.
\v 51 Here is Rebekah! Bring her to be the wife of the son of your master— as the LORD has shown.”
\p
\v 52 When Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed down and praised the LORD.
\v 53 Then he brought out gold, silver and beautiful clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to Rebekah's mother and brother.
\v 54 Then he and the slaves who were with him ate and drank together. And that night they stayed there.
\p The next morning Abraham’s slave said, “Let us go back to our master Abraham.”
\p
\v 55 But Rebekah's brother and mother said, “Let Rebecca stay with us for about ten more days.”
\p
\v 56 Then he answered them, “The LORD has made my journey successful. So please do not make me stay any longer. Now let us go home to my master Abraham.”
\p
\v 57 They answered him, “Good/Well. If so let us ask Rebekah's opinion.”
\v 58 So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Do you want to go with this man?”
\p Rebekah replied, “Yes, I want to.”
\p
\v 59 So they allowed Rebekah and the woman who had taken care of her since childhood to go with Abraham's servant and the slaves of Abraham.
\v 60 And before leaving, they blessed Rebekah and said,
\q2 “Our younger sister, may the LORD give you thousands and even millions of descendants (children and grandchildren),
\q2 and let them rule over the cities of their enemies.”
\p
\v 61 So Rebekah rose up with the young women who became her slaves. They rode on camels, then departed following Abraham’s servant. In that way, Abraham’s servant brought Rebekah and left.
\p
\p
\p
\v 62 Now Isaac had recently returned to his home at Negeb from the area of the well of Lahai-Roi.\f + \fr 24:62 \ft See the meaning of Lahai-Roi in Kej. 16: 14 \f*
\v 63 One afternoon, when he came out from the encampment to be alone and was walking in the field, he saw camels coming from afar.
\v 64 When Rebekah saw Isaac, she got down from her camel
\v 65 and asked Abraham's servant, “Who is that man on the field— who is walking toward us?”
\p Then the servant replied, “He is my master.” So Rebekah took her veil and covered her face.\f + \fr 24:65 \fk veil … \ft In the customs of that time, every bride must wear a head covering. So when Rebecca covered her face with a veil, she was showing respect to her bridegroom Isaac, and simultaneously showing that she was ready to be married to him.\f*
\v 66 The servant told Isaac everything that had happened.
\p
\v 67 So Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother's tent, Sarah, and took her as his wife. Isaac loved Rebekah very much. In that way his heart was comforted after his mother's death.
