\c 32
\s1 Jacob prepares to meet Esau
\p
\v 1 Then Jacob and his family continued their journey. And in that journey God's angels met him.
\v 2 When Jacob saw the angels, he said, “This is God's encampment!” Then he named that place Mahanaim.\f + \fr 32:30 \fk Mahanaim \ft means ‘two camps’ Compare with Ps. 34:7(8)\ft .\f*
\p
\v 3 After that event, Jacob sent messengers to bring news to Esau, his older brother, in the area of Seir in the land of Edom.
\v 4 He ordered them to deliver a mesage to Esau: “Sir, during all this time I have lived with our uncle Laban.
\v 5 Now I own cows, donkeys, goats, sheep, male slaves and female slaves. I'm sending messengers to tell Sir about my arrival with the hope that you/Sir will be kind hearted to me.”
\p
\v 6 Then the previously mentioned messengers returned and told Jacob, “We met Esau, your older brother. He is on his way to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.”
\v 7 On hearing that, Jacob became very afraid. Then he ordered all of the people in his group be divided into two groups, and he ordered his slaves to divide all of the animals he owned into two groups too— including sheep, goats, cows and camels.
\v 8 Jacob did this because he thought, “If Esau attacks the first group, then people in the second group might be able to save themselves.”
\p
\v 9 Then Jacob prayed, “Yes LORD, the God who was worshiped by my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac! You are the one who ordered me to go home to my land and to my family. You are also the one who promised to treat me with kind-heartedness.
\v 10 I'm not worthy to receive the kindness and faithfulness that you show to me. When I crossed the Jordan river to go to Haran, I didn't own anything other than this walking stick. But now I own two large groups— with family and all our things.
\v 11 I ask, O LORD, save me from my brother Esau, because I am afraid that he might come and kill me along with my wives and children.
\v 12 Remember that You already said you would treat me with kindheartedness and make my descendants many— like the sand of the sea that can't be counted.”
\p
\v 13 So Jacob spent the night there. The next day he prepared a gift for Esau—
\v 14 that was 200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 female sheep, 20 male sheep,
\v 15 30 female camels with their young, 40 female cows, 10 male cows, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys.
\v 16 Then Jacob divided those livestock into several groups, he sent them to his slaves and said, "Go before me group by group, and make sure there is distance between each group.
\p
\v 17 He gave orders to the slaves of the first group, saying, "If you meet my older brother Esau, and he asks, ‘Where are you going? Who is your master? Who owns these flocks?’
\v 18 Then answer like this, ‘These animals are owned by your servant Jacob. He ordered us to take all these as a gift to Sir/you. Jacob himself is behind following us.’”
\v 19 And Jacob gave orders to each group of slaves that led those flocks saying “You all must say the same thing when you meet with my older brother Esau.
\v 20 And don't forget to say to him, ‘Your servant Jacob is behind following us.’” Jacob said in his heart, “Hopefully with this gift Esau will forgive me before we meet, and he will treat me with kindheartedness.”
\v 21 So Jacob sent the aforementioned gift ahead to Esau, while he himself spent the night in the camp.
\s1 Jacob wrestles with God\f + \fr 32:22 \fk Allah \ft The Hebrew text in verse 24 is ‘a man’ came and wrestled with Jacob. But it certainly was not an ordinary human. In the quotation marks of ‘man’ mentioned in verse 28, he mentions his identity as God. There are several interpretations about this: 1) God is Spirit, but has the power to do anything at all. He can come to earth using the body of a human, as what happened in Gen. 18. 2) It frequently happens in the Bible that an angel shows himself in the form of a man, but delivers God's words directly (like Gen. 16:9, and 22:11-12). \f*
\p
\v 22 That night Jacob rose and sent his whole family to cross the river Jabok— including his two wives, and his two wives that had the status of slaves— that is Bilhah and Zilpah, along with his eleven children.
\v 23 As soon as his family arrived across, he also ordered his slaves to carry all of his possessions across preceding him.
\v 24 Jacob stayed alone in the place where he had previously camped. Then a man came and wrestled with Jacob until dawn arrived.
\v 25 When that person realized that he couldn't defeat Jacob, he struck the base of Jacob's thigh so that it was sprained.
\v 26 Then the man said, “Let me go because dawn has arrived.”
\p But Jacob answered, “No! I won't release you until you bless me!”
\p
\v 27 The man asked: “What's your name?”
\p He answered, “Jacob.”
\p
\v 28 Then that person said to him, “Your name will no longer be called Jacob. But I give a new name to you— that is Israel,\f + \fr 32:28 \fk Israel \ft The meaning of the name Israel is ‘he wrestles with God’.\f* because you have wrestled with God and man, and you have won.”
\p
\v 29 Then Jacob said to him, “What is Your name?”
\p But the Person answered, “You don't need to ask what My name is!” Then He blessed Jacob.
\p
\v 30 Jacob named that place Peniel,\f + \fr 32:30 \fk Peniel \ft This meaning of Peniel is ‘the face of God’.\f* because he had stared at the face of God directly and he still lived.
\v 31 The sun had risen when Jacob left Peniel, and Jacob limped as a result of the base of his hip being sprained.
\v 32 Because of that up to now the Israelites don't eat the meat that covers the joint of the hip base. That is in memory of this event that happened to Jacob on that night.
