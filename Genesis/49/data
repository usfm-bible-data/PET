\s1 Jacob's final messages for his children
\p
\v 1 Jacob called his children to gather and gave messages to them, “My children, I will deliver what will happen to you all in times to come.
\q1
\v 2 ‘Gather, O children of Jacob and listen to Israel, your father.’
\q1
\v 3 Reuben, you are the firstborn, born when I was young.
\q1 Of my children, you are the one most honored, and the strongest compared to your younger siblings.
\q2
\v 4 Like turbulent water, you couldn't be controlled.
\q1 You and your descendants won't become the foremost and won't lead your brothers, because you made your father ashamed by having intimate relations with one of my wives.
\q2
\v 5 Simeon and Levi, you older and younger siblings are the ones who used the sword to do violence.
\q2
\v 6 I didn't want to be involved in your secret conversation, or even meet in order to plan evil things.
\q2 You two killed people with anger, and paralyzed oxen on purpose.
\q1
\v 7 Your anger is cursed that can't be controlled.
\q2 Cursed is your evil that is so vile.
\q1 I will scatter your descendants in all of the tribes of Israel,
\q2 and cause you to be spread among all the tribes of Jacob.
\q1
\v 8 Judah, your brothers praise you!
\q2 Your descendants will conquer your enemies.
\q1 Your brothers' descendants will also bow before you.
\q2
\v 9 The power of Judah's tribe is like a young lion who rests after it kills and is satisfied eating its prey.
\q2 No other person is bold to bother you all.
\q1
\v 10 The rod of the kingdom will not leave Judah,
\q2 or the government from your descendants,
\q1 until the moment he who comes will possess power—
\q2 which is he who is obeyed by all people groups.\f * \fr 49:10 he\fk … \ft In this age now the reader will understant that ‘he’ who is mentioned two times in this verse is Messiah— that is Christ Jesus. But ‘he’ intentionally isn't given a capital letter because all of the people who heard Jacob and in fact Moses when he wrote this story didn't understand that He who was meant was divine.\f*
\q2
\v 11 Judah's descendants will tie their donkeys to choice grape vines and wash their clothes in choice grape plants while drinking wine that is colored blood red.
\q1
\v 12 Your eyes are beautiful because they are darker than wine,
\q2 Your teeth are strong and white from milk.\f + \fr 49:12 verses \fk 11-12 \ft Jacob used analogies that showed that Judah's descendants would be blessed with prosperity and health. This means that the language in Jacob's blessing should not be understood literally. For example, verse 12 certainly doesn't mean that Judah's descendants eyes would be read because they drank too much wine.\f*
\q1
\v 13 Zebulon, you and your descendants will live in prosperity at the sea shore
\q2 because of trading with merchant ships that harbor offshore.
\q2 Kalian akan menguasai perdagangan sampai ke batas wilayah Sidon.
\q1
\v 14Issachar and your descendants, you all are like a strong donkey,
\q2 who lies among their cargo baskets.
\q1
\v 15 However because you all see the place where you lie there is good and the land is very beautiful,
\q2 then you will bring burdens on your backs and will do forced labor like slaves.
\q1
\v 16 Regarding Dan and his descendants, you all will judge your own people group\f + \fr 49:16 judge\fk … \ft Dan's name means ‘judge’ (Gen. 30.6), so Jacob prophesied that Dan's people group would live like his name.\f* and live like other tribes in Israel.
\q1
\v 17 Like snakes at the edge of the road, poisonous snakes at the edge of the footpath,
\q2 your descendants will bite the feet of a horse that passes and cause the rider to be thrown backward.”
\q1
\v 18 Then Jacob prayed, “Yes LORD, only for your salvation do I wait.”
\q1
\v 19 After that, Jacob returned to saying to his descendants, what will happen.
\q2 “Gad, you and your descendants will be attacked by robbers and will turn and rob them.
\q1
\v 20 Asher, you and your descendants will produce food supplies that are abundant and high quality, that are fit to be served to kings.
\q1
\v 21 Naphtali, you and your descendants will be like a deer that runs free,
\q2 that produces handsome descendants.
\q1
\v 22 Joseph, you and your descendants will be like a fertile tree by the edge of water,
\q2 with branches that grow over the wall and bear fruit heavily.
\q1
\v 23 Your enemies will attach you all with their bows and arrows and persecute you all.
\q1
\v 24 However your bows will remain sturdy and your arms remain strong. The power that you possess is power from the Almighty— who is the defender of Jacob.
\q2 Because the LORD is a shepherd and a rocky mountain place of all of Israel's protection.
\q1
\v 25 May God whom I worship help all of you.
\q2 May God Almighty bless all of you
\q1 with rain from the sky and water that wells in the earth.
\q2 He is the one who will bless all of you with many descendants.
\q1
\v 26 As your father, I am more blessed than the blessings received by my forefathers.
\q2 These blessings abound over you all, Joseph's people group. You all are considered to be princes among your brothers in the large people group of Israel.
\q1
\v 27 Benjamin, you and your people group will be like a wolf that is ferocious.
\q2 Day and night you will kill and exterminate your enemies.”
\p
\v 28 Those are the final messages delivered by Jacob to the twelve tribes of Israel, then he blessed them according to their individual situations.
\s1 Jacob's death
\p
\v 29 Then, Israel who was also named Jacob delivered this final message to them, “When I die, I want to be with my family and want to be buried with my ancestors in the Machpelah Cave which is located in the field owned by Ephron the Hittite.
\v 30 The location of this cave is in Machpela, not far from Marmre in Canaan. Abraham bought that field from Ephron to become a family grave.
\v 31 Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried there, also Isaac and his wife Rebekah. And I buried Leah there.
\v 32 That land and cave were bought from Hittite people. Bury me there.”
\p
\v 33 After delivering his final messages, Jacob [laid down//laid himself down] then died.
