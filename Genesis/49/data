\s1 Jacob's final messages for his children
\p
\v 1 Jacob called his children to gather and ordered to them, “My children, I will convey what will happen to you(pl) in times to come.
\q1
\v 2 Gather, O children of Jacob and listen to Israel, your father.
\q1
\v 3 Reuben, you are the firstborn, born when I was young.
\q2 Of my children, you should be the one most honored,
\q2 and the strongest compared to your younger siblings.
\q2
\v 4 But you can’t be controlled, like a flood that cannot be blocked.
\q2 You did a sin that was very shameful by having intimate relations with one of my wives.
\q2 So you and your descendants won't become the foremost
\q2 and won't lead your younger brothers.
\q1
\v 5 Simeon and Levi, you older and younger siblings
\q2 are the ones who used swords to do violence.
\q2
\v 6 I don't want to be involved in your secret conversations,
\q2 or agree with you in evil plans.
\q2 You two killed people with anger
\q2 and made oxen lame for fun.
\q2
\v 7 Cursed is your anger that can't be controlled.
\q2 Cursed is your evil that is so vile.
\q2 I will spread out you(pl) among the descendants of Israel,
\q2 and scatter you among all the tribes of Israel.
\q1
\v 8 Judah, your brothers praise you!
\q2 Your descendants will conquer your enemies.
\q2 My other children will also kneel before you.
\q2
\v 9 The power of Judah's tribe is like a young lion who rests after killing its prey and is satisfied after eating it.
\q2 No one at all will be so bold as to bother you(pl).
\q2
\v 10 The rod of the kingdom will not be taken from the tribe of Judah,
\q2 and his descendants will rule
\q2 until the time arrives for someone to come who has the right to posess the rod of the kingdom.
\q2 He is the ruler who will be obeyed by all nations.\f + \fr 49:10 someone … ruler \fk … \ft In this age now the reader will understand that the Person who is mentioned two times in this verse is the Messiah, that is Christ Jesus. But the TSI intentionally does not use capital letters for ‘someone’ and ‘ruler’, because all of the people who heard Jacob— and in fact Moses when he wrote this story— did not know that the Ruler who was meant is divine. The third line is very difficult to interpret in the MT. Like many translations (including TB), TSI translates this line according to what is found in the Septuagint.\f*
\q2
\v 11 He will tie his donkey to choice grape vines,
\q2 and wash his clothes in wine which is the color of red blood.
\q2
\v 12 His eyes are beautiful, darker than wine,
\q2 and your teeth are strong, whiter than milk.\f + \fr 49:12 metaphors in verses 11-12 \ft The metaphors here show that the ruler from the descendants of Judah will be blessed with prosperity and health. This verse doesn't mean that the eyes of the aforementioned ruler would be red because of drinking too much wine. The metaphors in Jacob’s blessing should not be taken literally.\f*
\q1
\v 13 Zebulon, you and your descendants will live in prosperity along the sea shore
\q2 and trade with merchant ships that harbor offshore.
\q2 Kalian akan menguasai perdagangan sampai ke batas wilayah Sidon.
\q1
\v 14 Issachar and your descendants, you all are like a strong but lazy donkey,
\q2 which even lies among their cargo baskets.
\q2
\v 15 However because you all see the place where you are relaxed is a good situation and the view is very beautiful,
\q2 then you will be forced to carry burdens on your backs and labor as slaves.
\q1
\v 16 Regarding Dan, you and your descendants will judge your own tribe\f + \fr 49:16 judge \fk … \ft Dan's name means ‘judge’ (Gen. 30.6), so Jacob prophesied that Dan's tribe would live up to his name.\f* and live like the other tribes in the nation of Israel.
\q2
\v 17 Like snakes at the edge of the road, poisonous snakes at the edge of the footpath,
\q2 your descendants will bite the feet of a horse that passes and cause the rider to be thrown backward.”
\b
\q1
\v 18 Then Jacob prayed, “Yes LORD, only for your salvation do I wait.”
\p
\v 19 After that, Jacob continued revealing about future times for the rest of his descendants.
\b
\q1 “Gad, you and your descendants will be attacked by robbers and you will turn and rob them.
\q1
\v 20 Asher, you and your descendants will produce food supplies that are abundant and high quality, that are fit to be served to kings.
\q1
\v 21 Naphtali, you and your descendants will be like a deer that runs free,
\q2 that produces handsome descendants.
\q1
\v 22 Joseph, you and your descendants will be like a fertile tree by the edge of water,
\q2 with branches that grow over the wall and bear fruit heavily.
\q2
\v 23 Your enemies will attack you all with their bows and arrows and persecute you(pl).
\q2
\v 24 However your bows will remain sturdy and your arms remain strong. The power that you possess is power from the Almighty, who is Jacob’s shelter.
\q2 Because the LORD is like a shepherd and a rocky mountain place of protection for all of Israel.
\q2
\v 25 May God whom I worship help all of you.
\q2 May God Almighty bless all of you
\q2 with rain from the sky and water that wells in the earth.
\q2 He is the one who will bless all of you with many descendants and plenty of cattle.
\q2
\v 26 My blessing, as your father, is bigger and more profitable than the abundance of natural resources in/of the mountains and hills that existed from the earliest times.
\q2 These blessings will abound upon you, Joseph's tribe. You will lead among your brothers in the large nation of Israel.
\q1
\v 27 Benjamin, you and your people group will be like a wolf that is ferocious.
\q2 By day you will exterminate your enemies,
\q2 and in the evening you will divide the plunder.”
\p
\v 28 Those are the final messages delivered by Jacob to the twelve tribes of Israel. He blessed them according to their individual situations.
\s1 Jacob's death
\p
\v 29 Then Jacob delivered this final message to them, “When I die, I want to be buried with my ancestors in the cave which was bought by Abraham from Ephron the Hittite.
\v 30 The location of this cave is in Machpela, not far from Hebron in Canaan. Abraham bought that field from Ephron to become a family grave.
\v 31 Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried there, also Isaac and his wife Rebekah. And I buried Leah there.
\v 32 That land and cave were bought from Hittite people. Bury me there.”
\p
\v 33 After delivering his final messages, Jacob laid down and died.
