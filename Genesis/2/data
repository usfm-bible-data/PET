\s1 The seventh day
\p
\v 1 On the next morning, the creation of everything in heaven, the sky, and on earth was finished.
\v 2 So on the seventh day, because the creating of everything was finished, God stopped working.\f + \fr 2:2 \fk stopped \ft The word translated ‘stopped’ also can be translated ‘rested’. It needs to be remembered that the word ‘rest’ doesn't have the implication that God had become tired.\f*
\v 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and established it as a holy day, because on that seventh day He had stopped after creating everything.
\s1 Retelling the story of the creation of mankind
\p
\v 4 This is what happened when the LORD God had just recently created the sky and earth:
\v 5 In the beginning there were no plants that could grow, because the Lord God hadn't caused rain to fall on the earth. Moreover, there was no person who could work the ground to plant plant seeds in it.
\v 6 But there were many springs that bubbled-up from the ground\f + \fr 2:6 \fk springs … \ft The word translated as ‘springs’ is translated as ‘mist’ in translations that follow KJV, but it is more accurately translated as ‘springs’.\f* so that all the face of the ground became wet.
\v 7 So the LORD God took a bit of ground \f + \fr 2:7 bit of ground \ft The Hebrew word that is translated here as ‘bit of ground’ is often translated as ‘dust’. That meaning appears to be influenced by the KJV ‘dust’. And certainly, the meaning of ‘dust’ often fits in poems in books other than the OT. But according to verse 6 in this section, it is clear that God shaped man from a bit of ground that was already wet. \f*, and shaped a man from it. He blew breath of life into the nostrils of that man, so that man became a living creature.
\p
\v 8 Before that the LORD God had made a garden that was placed in the east\f + \fr 2:8 \fk east side \ft Based on the position of the river that is explained in the following verses, we know that the garden of Eden was placed to the east of the region of Kanaan. \f* that was called Eden. In this garden He placed the man that He had already created.
\v 9 Then the LORD God caused to grow every kind of tree that was beautiful and produced delicious fruit. He also placed in the middle of the garden two trees. The first was called the tree of life— that is a tree whose fruit were able to give eternal life. And the second tree was called the tree of knowledge— which was a tree whose fruit were able to give knowledge to distinquish good deeds from evil.
\p
\v 10 There was a large river whose headwater source was in Eden. After going out of Eden, the river branched becoming four child rivers.
\v 11 The first river was named Pishon. That was the river that flowed past the length of the region of Havila,\f + \fr 2:11 \ft The region that was meant isn't known, and the landscape of that region certainly changed when the flood occured. But because of information gotten in verses 13-14, it is possible that Havila is the western part and southern of the land of Arabia.\f* where there is a lot of gold.
\v 12 The gold that was found in Havila was very pure, and also there was found there fragrant substances from tree resin and precious gem stones.
\v 13 The second river was called Gihon. That river flowed the length of the land of Cush. \f + \fr 2:13 \fk Gihon… Cush\ft Usually in the OT, Cush shows a place that now is called the country of Ethiopia. If so, the Gihon river could be equated with the Nile river.\f*
\v 14 The third river mentioned was the Tigris. That river flowed to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river was called Euphrates.\f + \fr 2:14 \fk Tigris … Euphrates \ft Those two rivers are in the country that is in this time called Iraq. In Bible history, that country was known as Babylon.\f*
\p
\v 15 The LORD God took and placed man in the garden of Eden to care for and manage that garden.
\v 16 The LORD God said to him, “I permit you to eat your fill of the fruit of every tree in the garden,
\v 17 except for this one, which is the fruit of the tree that can give knowledge to distinguish good deeds and evil. Don't you eat that fruit. Because if you eat it, you will die on that very day!\f + \fr 2:17 \fk on that very day \ft The Hebrew word translated as ‘on that very day’ evidently has a wider meaning than the time span of a day. We can know that because Adam and Eve didn't die on the day they ate that fruit. But they died in future days. We can also understand that by the words 'on that day too', God was speaking about spiritual death, not about physical death.\f*
\p
\v 18 The LORD God said, “It isn't good for man to just be only a single person. It's better that I make a companion person that is fit for him.”
\v 19 But before that happened, using a bit of dirt/earth, the LORD God made every kind of animal and bird from. Then every kind of animal and bird one by one were shown to that man so that they were named by him. In that way all the kinds of animals and birds were given names.
\v 20 Then the man gave names to every kind of lifestock, wild animals and birds. But he dindn’t find even one of those creatures that was fit to become his companion.
\v 21 So the LORD God made the man sleep very deeply. At that time, the Lord took a rib bone and closed the hole again.
\v 22 Then the LORD God shaped a woman from that rib bone that He had removed, and then brought her to the man.
\v 23 Then the man said,
\q1 “This is she who is fit for me!
\q2 Her bones are my bones, and her flesh is from my flesh!
\q1 I will call her 'woman',
\q2 because she was taken from me.\f + \fr 2:23 \fk woman … from me \ft In Hebrew there is a simlarity that is very poetic between ‘woman’ (ishah) dan ‘man’ (ish). The two words that TSI translates as ‘from me’, literally are ‘from man’.\f*
\p
\v 24 That is the reason, when a man and a woman form a new family, the man leaves his parents and becomes one with his wife.\f + \fr 2:24 \fk man … \ft It is often asked, “Why isn’t the woman also mentioned as leaving her parents. Does this mean that the new family will live together with the parents of the woman?” The answer to that question probably is related to Jewish customs. It is highly probable that this verse mentions men especially since he becomes the head of the family.\f*
\s1 The first people sinned because they didn't obey God
\p
\v 25 The man and woman were of course naked, but they didn't feel shame toward each other.
