\s1 The seventh day
\p
\v 1 The next morning, everything in heaven, the sky, and on the earth was finished being created.
\v 2 So on the seventh day, because the creation of everything was finished, God stopped working.\f + \fr 2:2 \fk stopped \ft The word translated ‘stopped’ also can be translated ‘rested’. It needs to be remembered that the word ‘rest’ doesn't have the implication that God had become tired.\f*
\v 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and established it as a holy day, because on that seventh day He stopped after creating everything.
\s1 Retelling the story of the creation of mankind
\p
\v 4 This is what happened when the LORD God had just created the sky and earth:
\v 5 In the beginning there were not yet any plants growing, because the LORD hadn't caused rain to fall on theface of the earth. And there was no person to work the ground to plant it.
\v 6 But there were many springs that bubbled-up from the ground\f + \fr 2:6 \fk springs … \ft The word translated as ‘springs’ is translated as ‘mist’ in translations that follow KJV, but it is more accurately translated as ‘springs’.\f* so that all the face of the ground became wet.
\v 7 Then the LORD God took a bit of ground \f + \fr 2:7 bit of ground \ft The Hebrew word that is translated here as ‘bit of ground’ is often translated as ‘dust’. That meaning appears to be influenced by the KJV ‘dust’. And certainly, the meaning of ‘dust’ often fits in poems in books other than the OT. But according to verse 6 in this section, it is clear that God shaped man from a bit of ground that was already wet. \f*, and formed a man from it. He blew the breath of life into the nostrils of the man, so man became a living creature.
\p
\v 8 Before that the LORD God had made a garden that was placed in the east\f + \fr 2:8 \fk east side \ft Based on the position of the river that is explained in the following verses, we know that the garden of Eden was placed to the east of the region of Kanaan. \f* which was called Eden. In that garden He placed the man that He had created.
\v 9 Then the LORD grew every kind of tree that was beautiful and produced delicious fruit. He also placed two trees in the middle of the garden. The first was the tree whose fruit was able to give eternal life. And the second tree was the tree whose fruit waw able to give knowledge to distinquish good deeds from evil deeds.
\p
\v 10 There was a large river whose headwater source was in Eden. After going out of Eden, the river branched becoming four rivers.
\v 11 The first river was named Pishon. That was the river that flowed through the length of the region of Havila,\f + \fr 2:11 \ft The region that was meant isn't known, and the landscape of that region certainly changed when the flood occured. But because of information gotten in verses 13-14, it is possible that Havila is the western part and southern of the land of Arabia.\f* where there was a lot of gold.
\v 12 The gold that was found in Havila was very pure, and there were also fragrant substances from the resin of plants, and valuable gem stones found there.
\v 13 The second river was called Gihon. That river flowed the length of the land of Cush. \f + \fr 2:13 \fk Gihon… Cush\ft Usually in the OT, Cush shows a place that now is called the country of Ethiopia. If so, the Gihon river could be equated with the Nile river.\f*
\v 14 The third river was called Tigris. That river flowed to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river was called Euphrates.\f + \fr 2:14 \fk Tigris … Euphrates \ft Those two rivers are in the country that is in this time called Iraq. In Bible history, that country was known as Babylon.\f*
\p
\v 15 The LORD God took and placed man in the garden of Eden to care for and manage that garden.
\v 16 The LORD said to him, “I permit you to eat your fill of the fruit of every tree in the garden,
\v 17 except for this one, which is the fruit of the tree that can give knowledge to distinguish good deeds and evil deeds. Don't eat that fruit. Because if you eat it, you will certainly die on that very day!\f + \fr 2:17 \fk on that very day \ft The Hebrew word translated as ‘on that very day’ evidently has a wider meaning than the time span of a day. We can know that because Adam and Eve didn't die on the day they ate that fruit. But they died in future days. We can also understand that by the words 'on that day too', God was speaking about spiritual death, not about physical death.\f*
\p
\v 18 The LORD God said, “It isn't good for man to just be one person. It's better that I make a companion that fits him.”
\v 19 But before that happened, using a bit of dirt/earth, the LORD made every kind of animal and bird. Then every kind of animal and bird were shown to the man one by one so that they were named by him. In that way all the kinds of animals and birds got named.
\v 20 Then the man gave names to every kind of lifestock, wild animal and bird. But he didn’t find any one of those creatures was fit to become his companion.
\v 21 Then the LORD made the man sleep very deeply. At that time, the LORD took a rib bone and closed the hole again.
\v 22 Then the LORD God made a woman from that rib bone that He had removed, then brought her to the man.
\v 23 Then the man said,
\q1 “This is she who is fit for me!
\q2 Her bones are from my bones, and her flesh is from my flesh!
\q1 I will call her 'woman',
\q2 because she was taken from me.\f + \fr 2:23 \fk woman … from me \ft In Hebrew there is a simlarity that is very poetic between ‘woman’ (ishah) dan ‘man’ (ish). The two words that TSI translates as ‘from me’, literally are ‘from man’.\f*
\p
\v 24 For that reason, when a man and a woman form a new family, the man leaves his parents and becomes one with his wife.\f + \fr 2:24 \fk man leaves … \ft Even though it is said that a man leaves his father and mother, it doesn’t mean that he cuts his connections with his parents. And it also doesn’t mean that the man joins with his wife’s family. The meaning of this text is that the man separates from his parents to form a new family with his wife. It is probable that this verse especially \ft mentions the man since he becomes the head of the family.\f*
\p
\v 25 The man and woman were naked of course, but they didn't feel ashamed in front of each other.
