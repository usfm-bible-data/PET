\s1 The seventh day
\p
\v 1 On the next morning, the creation of everything in the levels of the sky and on earth was finished.
\v 2 So on the seventh day, because the creating of everything was finished, God stopped working.\f + \fr2:2 \fk stopped \ft The word translated ‘stopped’ also can be translated ‘rest’. It needs to be remembered that the word ‘rest’ doesn't have the implication that God had become tired.\f*
\v 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and established it as a holy day, because on that seventh day He had stopped after creating everything.
\s1 Retelling the story of the creation of mankind
\p
\v 4 This is what happened when the LORD God was creating the sky and earth:
\v 5 In the beginning there were no plants that could grow, because the Lord God hadn't caused rain to fall on the earth. Moreover, there was no person who could work the ground—to plant plant seeds in it.
\v 6 But a mist appeared from the ground so that all the face of the ground became wet.
\v 7 So the LORD God took a bit of ground \f + \fr2:7 bit of ground \ft This word in the Hebrew language 'apar' is often translated 'dust' because of the influence of the KJV 'dust', and the meaning of 'dust' often fits in poems in books other than the OT. But according to verse 6, it's clear that God shaped man from a bit of ground that was already wet. \f*, and shaped a man from it. He blew breath of life into the nostrils of that man, so that man became a living creature.
\p
\v 8 Before that the LORD God had made a garden that was placed on the east side \f + \fr 2:8 \fk east side \ft It's clear from the position of the river that is told about in the following verses, the garden of Eden was placed to the east of the region of Kanaann. \f* that was called Eden. In this garden He placed the man that He had already created.
\v 9 Then the LORD God planted every kind of tree that was beautiful and produced delicious fruit. He also placed in the middle of the garden two trees. The first was called the tree of life—which was a tree that produced fruit that gave eternal life. And the second tree mentioned was the tree of knowledge— which was a tree whose fruit were able to give knowledge to distinquish good deeds from evil.
\p
\v 10 There was a large river whose headwater source was in Eden. After going out of Eden, the river branched becoming four child rivers.
\v 11 The first river was named Pishon. That was the river that flowed past the length of the region of Havila \f + \fr 2:11 \ft The region that was meant isn't known, and the landscape of that region certainly changed when the flood occured. But because of information gotten in verses 13-14, it is possible that Havila became the western part and southern of the land of Arabia.\f*—where there is a lot of gold.
\v 12 The gold that was found in Havila was very pure, and also there was found there fragrant substances from tree resin and precious valuable jewels.
\v 13 The second river was called Gihon. That river flowed the length of the land of Cush. \f + \fr 2:13 \fk Gihon... Cush\ft Usually in the OT, Cush shows a place that now is called the country of Ethiopia. If so, the Gihon river could be the same as the Nile river.\f*
\v 14 The third river mentioned was the Tigris. That river flowed next to East Assyria. And that fourth river was called Euphrates. \f + \fr 2:14 \fk Tigris ... Euphrates \fk Those two rivers are in the country that is now called Iraq. In Bible history, that country was known as Babylon.\f*
\p
\v 15 The LORD God took and placed man in the garden of Eden to care for and manage that garden.
\v 16 The LORD God said to him, "I permit you to eat fruit of every tree in the garden with satisfaction— except for this one, which is:
\v 17 the fruit of the tree that can give knowledge to distinguish good deeds and evil. Don't you eat that fruit, because if you eat it, you will die on that day too! \f + \fr 2:18 \fk on that day too \ft The word 'beyowm' in the Hebrew language can mean far more than 'on that day too'. We can know that because obviously Adam and Eve didn't leave the earth on the day they ate that fruit. But in future days they obviously died. Or, in the words 'on that day too' God could have meant spiritual death—not about physical death.*
\p
\v 18 The LORD God said, "It isn't good for man to just be by himself. It's better that I make a person as life companion that is fit for him."
\v 19 Bt the LORD God didn't immediately make that companion. He took a bit of dirt then shaped every kind of animal and bird from that dirt. Then God said to that man, "I give you authority to give names to every animal and bird." Then God brought every creature to him to be named.
\v 20 Then the man gave names to every kind of lifestock, wild animals and birds. But there wasn't even one of those creatures that was fit to become his companion.
\v 21 So the LORD God made the man sleep very deeply. At that time, the Lord took a rib bone and closed the hole again.
\v 22 Then the LORD God shaped a woman from that rib bone that He had removed, and brought it to the man.
\v 23 And happily the man said,
\q1 "This is she who is fit for me!
\q2 Her bones are my bones, and her flesh is my flesh!
\q1 So I will call her 'woman',
\q2 because she was taken from me.
\p
\v 24-25 The man and woman were naked of course, but they didn't feel shame toward each other.
\p In the beginning woman was taken from man, so that's why when a man and woman form a new family, the man leaves his parents and becomes one with his wife. \f + \fr 2:24 \fk man ... \ft There is often the question why the woman isn't also mentioned as leaving her parents. Does this mean that the new family will live together with the parents of the woman? The answer to that question might be connected to the custom of Jews. It is quite possible that this verse mentions men especially since he becomes the head of the family. And again, it doesn't fit for the husband in a couple's new life to live with in-laws, because he will be inclined to submit to his in-laws.\f*
