\c 15
\s1 The Lord promised to Abram
\p
\v 1 Some time later, the Lord spoke to Abram in a vision and said, “Do not be afraid, Abram! I will protect you from anything and will give you a great reward.”
\p
\v 2-3 But Abram said to him, “Lord, what good do You give me for big income while I have no descendant to inherit it? I am forced to choose Eliezer— my servant from Damascus, as my heir.”
\p
\v 4 The Lord said, “No! Your servant will not inherit your possessions. You will have a son who will inherit everything you have.”
\v 5 Then the Lord took Abram out of his tent and said, “Look at the sky, Can you count the number of stars in the sky? Of course not! Even so your descendants will be too numerous to count— like the stars in the sky.”
\p
\v 6 So Abram fully believed in all that God had said. Therefore, God accepted Abram as a righteous person. [The word 'benar' on its own means 'true'. Combined with 'person' it means upright/righteous.]
\p
\v 7 Then the Lord said to him, “I am the LORD. I have brought you out of the city of Ur in the land of Chaldea to give this land to you to be your possession.”
\p
\v 8 But Abram said, “Lord, how do you know that you will give me this land?”
\p
\v 9 God said to him, “Bring me a she-goat, a young goat, and a ram that is three years old. Bring also a dove and a pigeon.”
\v 10 So Abram took the beasts, slaughtered them, and split them into two parts— except he did not split the two birds. Then he [juxtaposed//lined up] each half from those animals in two lines according to their pairs.\f + \fr 15:10 \fk custom of ratifying a covenant \ft What Abraham did here can be explained according to the customs for ratifying covenants between kings or important persons found outside the Bible. Normally the two parties would walk between the lines of animals split in two, as a picture that if one of them breaks the agreement that has been made, the one who breaks it is as if saying, “Let happen to me what has happened to these animals!”\f*
\v 11 The birds which eat carion alighted to eat the aforementioned meat, but Abram drove them away.
\p
\v 12 In the evening when the sun had set, Abram fell sound asleep, and suddenly in the darkness a feeling of deep fear surrounded/engulfed him.
\v 13 At that moment God said to him, “Know that your offspring will be strangers in another country. They will become slaves to the local residents, who will oppress them for 400 years.
\v 14 But I will punish the inhabitants of that land who will enslave your descendants. After that your descendants will leave that land with many (costly) possessions.
\v 15 But you will die in peace when your age is very old and you will be buried.
\v 16 After 400 years\f + \fr 15:16 \fk 400 years \ft Literally ‘four generations’. Apparently God uses the word ‘generation’ for a longer time than the literal sense— just four generations.\f* your descendants will return to this land, and to recapture this land from the Amorites through the war, and control the land. Now the wickedness of the Amorites has not exceeded the limit to be punished.”
\p
\v 17 When the sun went down and the sky became dark, suddenly a flaming torch appeared with a smoky pan of charcoal\f + 15:17 \fk torch and pan \ft See the footnote at verse 10. The two objects symbolize the LORD's presence. Notice that only the LORD passed through the two lines of split animals. This means, that the One responsible for fulfilling this formal promise is the LORD alone.\f* going between in the middle of the two lines of the cut meat that were side by side and the two birds.
\v 18 On that same day the Lord also made a promise to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give all this land— from the border of Egypt to the south\f + \fr 15:18 \fk border of Egypt \ft Literally, ‘stream of Egypt’— which is a small stream in the southeast from the border of Egypt. The meaning intended is not the River Nile. (NET note says northeast, but that is thinking of it from Egypt's perspective. Looking from Canaan, it would be southeast.)\f* to the Euphrates River in the north.
\v 19-21 That is the land of these nations/races: Ken, Kenis, Kadmon, Heth, Perez, Refah, Amor, Canaan, Girgas, and Jebus.”
