\c 45
\s1 Joseph tells who he is
\p
\v 1 Joseph wasn't able to hold back his feelings, so he ordered all of his servants to leave the room. When he was alone with his brothers he said, “I am Joseph.”
\v 2 Joseph cried with a loud voice so that it was heard by several of the Egyptian people and the news spread to the king.
\p
\v 3 Then Joseph called out again, “I am Joseph, your brother! Is it true that our father still lives?” His brothers could only be quiet because of surprise.
\v 4 Joseph said to his brothers, “ Come close,” so they just came close. “I'm Joseph, whom you all sold to the merchants that brought me to Egypt.
\v 5 You all shouldn't feel guilty or angry toward yourselves because you sold me. It was God who arranged that I come here first in order to save many peoples lives.”
\v 6 Joseph continued, “The famine has been two years and still will continue for five years in the future. No one can plow or plant their gardens.
\v 7 God has sent me to go ahead of you, in order that I could save you in an amazing way, and so that your descendants will remain on the earth.
\v 8 So it wasn't you who made plans so that I was carried here, but God himself was the one who appointed me as advisor to the king, master of his whole palace, and authority over all Egypt.”
\p
\v 9 Joseph commanded his brothers, “Return quickly to father and say,
\pi ‘Your child Joseph still lives! God has appointed him as ruler over all Egypt. Come quickly! Don't delay!
\v 10 Bring all of your possessions and all your cows, sheep, and goats. In order that you can be close to me, (our) father along with all of his children and grandchildren will live in the Gosyen region.\f + \fr 45:10 \fk Goshen \ft The region of Goshen is located to the northeast of the Nile river delta.\f*
\v 11 This famine will continue for five more years. For that reason it is best for father and all of my brothers to live close to me, so I can meet all of your(pl) needs and your livestock‘s (needs). In that way you(pl) will not die because of this big famine.’”
\p
\v 12 Joeph continued, “You all and especially Benjamin can see with your own eyes in your head that I myself am the one speaking to you all.
\v 13 Tell father about my glory/triumph that you all have seen yourselves here in Egypt. Then quickly bring father to me!”
\v 14 Then Joseph and his younger sibling Benjamin hugged each other and the two of them cried.
\v 15 He also kissed and hugged his older siblings while crying. Then they all began speak with him.
\s1 The king invites Joseph's family to live in Egypt
\p
\v 16 The news about the presence of Joseph's brothers was heard up to the king's palace. The king and even all of his officials shared the happiness.
\p
\v 17 Then the king said to Joseph, “Order your brothers to load as much food supplies that they need on their donkeys and go home to Canaan.
\v 18 Let them return here bringing your father along with all of the members of the family to live here. I will give the best land of Egypt, and they will own more than enough to live here.
\v 19 Also order them to take some carts to pick up your father, the women, and little children.
\v 20 They don't need to think about possessions that they have to leave, because the best things in our land will become their possessions.”
\p
\v 21 Jacob's children did what the king had commanded. Joseph gave several carts and also enough supplies for the journey.
\v 22 Joseph also gave to each of his older siblings one set of clothing. To his younger sibling Benjamin he gave five sets of changes of clothing, also the sum of three hundred silver coins.
\v 23 Besides that, Joseph also sent to his father, ten male donkeys that carried cargo that consisted of the best produce of Egypt, and ten female donkeys that carried cargo of wheat, bread and other food supplies as food for his father's journey to Egypt.
\v 24 When he released his brothers for the journey home, Joseph gave the order so that they wouldn't fight with each other on the journey.
\v 25 Then they began the journey home going out of Egypt to return to their father in Canaan.
\p
\v 26 They brought the news to their father, “Joseph is still alive! He is the ruler over all of Egypt!” When hearing that news, Jacob was surprised and didn't immediately believe their words.
\v 27 The contents of Joseph's message was delivered to Jacob. After seeing the carts that were sent to pick him up, Jacob's desire to live was revived again.
\p
\v 28 Jacob said, “My son Joseph still lives! That alone is the longing of my heart, to be able to meet him before I die.”
