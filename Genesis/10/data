\v 8 Cush had a son named Nimrod. He was the first person in the world to be a famous mighty man in war.
\v 9 The Lord blessed Nimrod so that he became a mighty hunter. That is why people often say, “May your son be like Nimrod— a mighty hunter because of God's blessing.”
\v 10 Nimrod became king and ruled in the land of Babylonia, which is also known as Sinear. There were four important regions in his kingdom: the capital of Babel, Erek, Akad, and Kalne.

\v 13 The second son of Ham was Egypt,\f + \fr 10:13 \fk Mesir \ft The name of Egypt in Hebrew was Mizraim.[This footnote is added because the TB uses the translateration Misraim and people will notice the difference.]\f* who became the ancestor of the Ludimites, \f + \fr 10 : 13 \fk Ludim \ft The Ludim are African tribes located in the western estuary of the Nile.\f* Anamim,\f + \fr 10:13 \fk Anamin \ft Anamin live in the region of North Egypt, to the west of Egypt near Kirene.\f* Lehabim,\f + \fr 10:13 \fk Lehabim \ft This nation is now known as the Libyans.\f* Naftuhim,\f + \fr 10:13 \fk Naftuhim \ft The Naftuhim nation settled in the estuary of the Nile in Egypt.\f*

\v 16 Canaan was the ancestor of the people of Jebus, Amori, Girgas,
\v 17 Hewi, Arki, Sini,
\v 18 Arvadi, Shemariah, and Hamath. Later/Afterwards the descendants of Canaan were widespread.

\v 24 The son of Arpaksad was named Selah. The son of Selah was Eber.
\v 25 Eber had two children/sons. The first was named Peleg and the second was named Joktan. The meaning of Peleg's name is ‘split up’. He was given this name because in his day the people on earth would be separated and scattered throughout the earth.
