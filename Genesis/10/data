\v 9 The Lord blessed Nimrod so that he became a mighty hunter. That is why people often say, “May your son be like Nimrod— a mighty hunter because of God's blessing.”

\v 16 Canaan was the ancestor of the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgas,
\v 17 Hewi, Arki, Sini,
\v 18 Arvadi, Shemariah, and Hamath. Then the descendants of Canaan were widespread.
\v 19 The land that they had belonged was from the city of Sidon to the north, and extended to Gaza in the south. Then in the east, they occupy the city of Gerar, then extend to the cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, to the city of Lasa.
\p
\v 20 All these are the sons of Ham. They live in their own clan according to their tribe, language, land and nation.
\s1 The line of Shem
\p
\v 21 All Japheth and Ham were the ancestors of all the Hebrews.
\v 22 The names of each of his sons are the names of their own descendants in the future. Their names are Elam, Assyria, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
\v 23 Likewise the sons of Aram, the names of their sons, were the names of the tribes of their own descendants in the future. Their names are Us, Hul, Geter and Mas.
\v 24 The Arpacharite was named Selah. The son of Selah was Eber.
\v 25 Eber has two children. The first was Peleg and the second was Joktan. Meaning Peleg's name is 'split up'. He was given this name because in his day the people on earth would be separated and scattered throughout the earth.
\v 26 Yoktan was the ancestor of Almodad, Seleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
\v 27 Hadoram, Uzal, Dikla,
\v 28 Obal, Abimael, Seba,
