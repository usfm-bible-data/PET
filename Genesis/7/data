\c 7
\s1 The Lord brought rain and great flood
\p
\v 1 Then the Lord said to Noah, “I see that you are the only one who does my will in this age. Therefore go into the ship with your whole family.
\v 2 Of every species of animal that is (ritually) clean/lawful, bring seven pairs into the ship— seven male and seven female. As for every animal that is (ritually) unclean, bring one pair only— one male and one female.
\v 3 Likewise with the bird, take seven pairs of every species. Do it so that every kind of living thing can continue to multiply after the flood.
\v 4 Because in/after seven days I will send rain on the earth forty days and forty nights. I will destroy all the living things, which I have created on the face of the earth.”
\p
\v 5 Then Noah did all that the Lord had commanded him.
\p
\v 6 When that big flood hit the earth, Noah was six hundred years old.
\v 7 To save themselves from that big flood, Noah entered the ship with his wife, his three sons, and his three daughters-in-law.
\v 8-9 In accordance with what God has commanded Noah, all species of animals that are clean and unclean, birds, creeping animals and creeping animals (with legs), came to Noah in pairs to enter the ship.
\v 10 Then seven days later the great flood came to fill the earth.
\p
\v 11 On the seventeenth day, a month after Noah became 600 years old, all the water springs under the ground suddenly overflowed, and the rain descended heavily as if all the water gates in sky were opened.
\v 12 Rain fell continually on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
\p
\v 13 On the day when the rain began to come down, Noah and his wife, his three sons— Shem, Japheth, and Ham, and the three wives of his sons, entered into the ship.
\v 14 Likewise also with all the beasts of the field, cattle, birds, winged beasts, creeping animals, and creeping things (with legs).
\v 15 All of them came in pairs and enterd into that ship with Noah—
\v 16 specifically male and female animals, just as God commanded Noah. And when they had entered into the ship, the LORD shut the door.
\p
\v 17-18 The flood that covered the whole earth continued to grow for forty days. The water was rising and continued rising, so the boat was lifted and floated on the surface of the water.
\v 19-20 And the water grew steadily higher until it covered all the mountains— even reaching a height of more or less seven meters\f + \fr 7:19-20 \fk seven meters \ft Literally translated, 15 cubits.\f* above the highest mountains in all the world.
\v 21-22 So all the living creatures died on the face of the earth— including birds, cattle, wild animals, creeping things, crawling creatures with legs, and people.
\v 23 All the living creatures died. Only Noah and those who were in the ship were saved.
\v 24 The great flood covered the surface of the earth for 150 days.
