\s1 Humans become very evil and carry out various kinds of evil
\p
\v 1 When the number of people increases on the face of the earth and many daughters are born,
\v 2 some of God's children\f + \fr 6:2 \fk the sons of God \ft There are many interpretations of what kind of ‘sons’\ft are intended. Most interpretations can be classified into two alternatives: 1) The children of God intended are angels who sided with the devil in his rebellion, then they were punished by God and thrown into this world. The angels are now called evil spirits or demons. If so, maybe the spirits possessed male humans, and in that way married the girls. 2) Or, the children of God intended are descendants of Set. This is in accordance with many verses in the OT that call the Israelites— all of whom were descendants of Set, as ‘sons of God’. In Ex. 4:22, the nation of Israel is also called the ‘firstborn son’ of God. Conclusion: We must admit that we do not always have enough information to interpret things like this. (Deut. 29:29) Truthfully interpretations 1) and 2) are not harmonious with Job 1:6 and 2:1 where the same phrase is used.\f* saw that human girls were very beautiful. Then, the sons of God took and made wives\f + \fr 6:2 \fk took and made wives \ft The word in Hebrew translated as ‘took and made wives’ indicates that the marriages have the implication of being done by force and not properly.\f* of whoever they liked from those girls.
\v 3 The Lord said, “I do not want the breath of life from Me to dwell in every human being forever. All humans are mortal beings who must die. I determine that every human being, his age will not exceed 120 years.”
\v 4 Many children were born because of those mixed marriages. And at that time people called nephilim appeared.\f + \fr 6:4 \fk nephilim \ft This word is taken directly from Hebrew, and the meaning is uncertain. In Hebrew, this verse does not directly say that nephilim are children born of mixed marriages with ‘\ft children of God’\ft (verse 2). But that can indeed be considered as an implication of the author. Nephilim are often interpreted as a giants, but it can also just mean 'strong/heroic person'. Depending on the interpretation chosen in verse 2, the nephilim were very evil strong people, or a strong people who were good (like a heroes).\f* They were famous in that time period as people who were very strong and heroes in the war.
\p
\v 5 The LORD saw that humans on earth have been very evil, and everything in their hearts was evil.
\v 6 So He was very sorry to have created humans on earth. That made His heart very sad.
\v 7 The Lord said, “I will destroy all men, animals, creeping things, creeping things (with legs), and birds. No one will be left behind from everything that is still lives on the earth. I am very sorry for creating all these living things aforementioned.”
\s1 Noah lived right in the eyes of God so he was protected from the disaster
\p
\v 8 But Noah pleased the Lord.
\v 9 This is the story of Noah: Of all the people who lived at that time, only his life was right in God's sight. Noah lived in close fellowship with God.
\v 10 Noah was the father of three sons— namely Sem, Ham and Japhet.
\v 11 At that time God saw that all the other humans on earth were very evil. They were mutually hateful and violent toward one another.
\v 12 God was very disappointed that the earth has been severely damaged by the crimes/evil committed by humans.
\p
\v 13 So God said to Noah, "I have decided to annihilate all human beings and other living beings, because the violence that humans have done with one another has filled the earth.
\v 14 Make for you a ship of choice wood.\f + \fr 6:14 \fk choice wood \ft In other translations, especially literal translations, the name of the wood is taken directly from Hebrew— namely ‘gofir’\ft wood. The difficulty is that that kind of wood no longer is known. But what is important is that that kind of wood was best wood at that time for building a ship.\f* Inside make several partitans so that plenty of rooms are made ready. And so that water can't enter, layer the inside and outside of the ship with tar.\f + \fr 6:14 \fk tar \ft Tar is the black material that is now used in asphalt. When heated, it melts. Then when it's cold again, it becomes thick and sticky.\f*
\v 15 This is the size you have to make: 138 meters in length, 23 meters in width, and 14 meters in height.\f + \fr 6:15 \fk the size in meters \ft Literally, "300 cubits," "50 cubits," and "30 cubits." One cubit is about 45 centimeters.\f*
\v 16 Make the roof of the boat, and give a distance of 45 centimeters between the roof and all the walls below it— so that air and light can enter. Make three decks inside— the upper deck, the middle deck and the lower deck. And make a door at the side of the ship.
\v 17 Listen carefully! I will bring a great flood on the earth to destroy all creatures that breathe under the sky. Everything on earth will die.
\v 18 But I promise that you and your wife, your three sons, and your three daughters in law will be saved inside of that ship.
\v 19 And because I want to save all species of living things, then you must bring two of each species of living thing— that is, one male and one female, so that every species of animal also lives.
\v 20 Two birds of each type, birds, animals, creeping things, and creeping animals will come to you, so that they can be included in the ship, so that they are preserved.
\v 21 You must also bring food supplies for you and for all the animals. Store everything in the boat.
\v 22 So Noah did everything God had commanded him.
