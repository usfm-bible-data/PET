\v 1 When Rahel realized that she was infertile, she felt jealous of her older sister Leah. Then she said to Jacob, “Give me a child! If not, let me die!”
\p
\v 2 Hearing this, Jacob became very angry and said, “So am I God? He is the one who made you barren! Not me!”
\p
\v 3 Rachel answered, “Here is my slave, Bilha! Take her and have sex with her, so that she will give birth to a child whom we will later consider to be the child I gave birth to.”\f + fr 30:3 \fk we will later consider to be the child that I gave birth to \ft Literally Rachel used a figure, ‘in order to give birth to a child on my lap’.\f*
\v 4 Jacob agreed, and Rachel gave her slave Bilha to her husband as a wife, and Jacob had sex with Bilha.
\v 5 Then Bilha conceived and gave birth to a son to Jacob.
\v 6 Then Rachel said, “God has justified me and heard my request. He has given me a son!” That is why she named the child Dan.\f + \fr 30:6 \fk Dan \ft The meaning of the name Dan is ‘He (LORD) justifies’, or ‘He judges’.\f*
\v 7 Then Bilha became pregnant again and gave birth to her second son.
\v 8 Then Rachel said, “I have fought against my sister, and in the end I have won.” That is why he named the child Naftali.\f + \fr 30:8 \fk Naftali \ft Naftali's name can mean ‘my struggle’.\f*
\p
\v 9 When Leah realized that she had not been pregnant for a long time, she gave her slave Zilpa to her husband as a wife.
\v 10 Then Zilpa became pregnant and gave birth to a son to Jacob.
\v 11 Leah said, “I am really lucky.” So she named the child Gad. \f + \fr 30:11 \fk Gad \ft The name Gad means ‘lucky’ or ‘luck’.\f*
\v 12 After that Zilpa gave birth to a son again.
\v 13 Leah says, “How happy I am. Women will say that I am happy.” Therefore she named the child Asher.\f + \fr 30:13 \fk Asher \ft The name Asher means ‘happy’.\f*
\p
\v 14 In the wheat harvest season, Reuben strolled and found a mandragora plant\f + \fr 30:14 \fk mandragora \ft Mandragora is called ‘dudaim’ in Hebrew. The roots of this poisonous plant are believed to be able to cure sterility. The root was processed into medicine (believed to) increase sexual desire.\f* in the fields and took it to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Lea, “Can I ask for some mandragora fruit brought by your child?”
\v 15 Leah replied, “Isn't it enough that you have taken my husband? Now you still dare to ask for the mandragora roots that my son brought to me?!”
\p Rachel replied, “If that's how it is, as compensation, let Jacob sleep with you tonight, and give the mandragora roots that your son brought to me.”
\p
\v 16 In the evening when Jacob returned from the field, Leah met him and said, “Tonight you must have sex with me, because I have given the mandragora roots to Rachel as a payment, so that tonight you must have sex with me.” So that night, Jacob has sex with Leah.
\v 17 God answered Leah's prayer, and she became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob.
\v 18 So Leah said, “God has rewarded me because I have given my servant to my husband.” That is why Lea named her son Isakar.\f + \fr 30:18 \fk Isakar \ft The name Isakar means ‘reward’.\f*
\v 19 Then Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob.
\v 20 Then Leah said, “God has given me an extraordinary gift. This time my husband will surely respect me because I have given him six sons.” Therefore she gave her son the name Zebulon.\f + \fr 30:20 \fk Zebulon \ft In Hebrew the name Zebulon can mean ‘honor’, or its sound is like ‘give praise’.\f*
\v 21 Time passed, and Leah gave birth to a daughter whom she named Dina.
\p
\v 22 Then God remembered Rachel and heard/granted her request. God allowed Rachel to get pregnant.
\v 23 So Rachel got pregnant and gave birth to a son. Rahel said, “God has erased my shame.”
\v 24 So she named her son Yusuf,\f + \fr 30:24 \fk Yusuf \ft In Hebrew the name Joseph sounds like ‘may He add’.\f* because she said, “May the Lord give me a son man again.”
\s1 Jacob's wealth increased
\p
\v 25 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob met with Laban and said, “Uncle, let me go back to the land of my birth.
\v 26 Let me take my wives and children, which I have obtained because of working for you, because you know that all this time I've worked hard for you.”
\p
\v 27 But Laban replied, “If you ware willing, stay here. I already know through oracles that the LORD has blessed me because of you.
\v 28 Just say what wages you want. I'm ready to pay it.”
\p
\v 29 Jacob replied, “You (Uncle) yourself know how I have worked hard for you, and how your livestock herds have been as long as I have taken care of them.
\v 30 Indeed, before I came your wealth was (only) a little, but now your wealth has multiplied in amount. The LORD has blessed you wherever I worked. So now it's time for me to work to meet the needs of my own family!”
\p
\v 31 Laban asked, “Then what should I give you to keep working for me here?”
\p Jacob replied, “You don't need to give me anything. But if you agree with my proposal, then I will continue to take care of your herds.
\v 32 Let me separate a part of your flock today— specifically every sheep that is speckled, striped, or black. Let those separated animals which are speckled, striped, or black haired, be my reward.
\v 33 So later you can prove my honesty. Some later time you may come and check my herd. If you find that there are among the animals I have separated, livestock whose fur is not speckled, has no spots, or is not black, you will have the right to assume that I stole those animals from you.”
\p
\v 34 Laban answered, “Alright, I agree!”
\v 35 But on that day Laban separated the male and female goats whose spots were speckled and striped, which were white and those with black hair. He gave those animals to his sons to guard.
\v 36 Then his children took those flocks away from Jacob and from the flocks of Laban's that he still was guarding. The distance between them and Jacob was three days.
\p
\v 37 Then Jacob cut branches from three kinds of trees, peeled off some of the bark into the inner part, so that the branches had the appearance of white stripes.\f + \fr 30:37 \fk three kinds of trees \ft The three kinds of trees are the blight tree, almond tree, and the chestnut tree.\f*
\v 38 Then he put the branches beside the drinking trough of the aforementioned cattle, so that the cattle could see the branches when they came to drink. The animals usually mated when they came to drink.
\v 39 When flocks mated in front of striped branches, the fur of animals born after this became striped, speckled, or mottled.
\v 40 Then Jacob separated the goats and ewes, from the Laban flock which he still shepherded. Every mating period, Jacob placed the flock of sheep and goats facing the flocks that were striped or dark-colored. The fur of animals that are later born become colored. In this way, he began to collect his own herds, separate from Laban's herd.
\v 41 When healthy goats and ewes were in heat, Jacob always placed the branches in the drinking trough in front of the herd, so that the goats and sheep would mate near the branches.
\v 42 However, Jacob did not put the branches in front of the unhealthy animals. Thus the animals born to unhealthy mothers became the property of Laban, and the animals born to healthy mothers became the property of Jacob.
\v 43 In this way, Jacob became very rich. He had very large herds, male and female servants, camels and donkeys.
