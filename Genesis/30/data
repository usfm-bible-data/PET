\p Rachel replied, “If that's how it is, as compensation, let Jacob sleep with you tonight, and give the mandragora roots that were brought by your son to me.”
\p
\v 16 In the evening when Jacob returned from the field, Leah met him and said, “Tonight you must sleep with me, because I have given mandragora roots to Rachel as a payment.” So that night, Jacob had sex with Leah.

\s1 Jacob's increases his wealth
\p
\v 25 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob met with Laban and said, “Uncle, let me go back to the land of my birth.
\v 26 Let me take my wives and children, which I have obtained because of working for you, because you know that all this time I've worked hard for you.”
\p
\v 27 But Laban replied, “If you are willing, stay here. I already know through oracles that the LORD has blessed me because you work for me.
\v 28 Just say what wages you want. I'm ready to pay it.”
\p
\v 29 Jacob replied, “Uncle (you) yourself know how I have worked hard for you, and how your livestock herds have been as long as I have taken care of them.
\v 30 Indeed, before I came Uncle's wealth was little, but now your wealth has multiplied in amount. The LORD has blessed you wherever I worked. So now it's time for me to work to meet the needs of my own family!”
\p
\v 31 Laban asked, “If it is like that, what must I give you to keep working for me here?”
\p Jacob replied, “Uncle doesn't need to give anything to me. But if Uncle agrees with my proposal, then I will continue to take care of Uncle's herds.
\v 32 Let me today separate from your flock every sheep that is speckled or striped, every lamb with black wool, and every goat that is speckled or striped. Let those animals be my reward.
\v 33 So later Uncle can prove my honesty. Uncle can come and check my herds of cattle/animals. If Uncle finds among my animals goats that are not speckled or striped, or sheep that are not colored black, Uncle will have the right to assume that I stole those animals from you.”
\p
\v 34 Laban answered, “Alright, I agree!”
\v 35 But on that day Laban separated the male and female goats who were speckled or striped, and which were white, and all the lambs with black wool. He gave those animals to his sons to be guarded.
\v 36 Then his children took those flocks away from Jacob and from the flocks of Laban's that he still was guarding. The distance between them and Jacob was three days.

\v 37 Then Jacob cut branches from three kinds of trees,\f + \fr 30:37 \fk three kinds of trees \ft This three kinds of trees mentioned in the Hebrew language are not found in Indonesia.

\v 38 Then he put the branches into the drinking trough of the previously mentioned flocks, so that the flocks could see the branches when they came to drink. The animals usually mated when they came to drink.
\v 39 When flocks mated in front of striped branches, the fur of animals born after this became striped, speckled, or mottled.
\v 40 Then Jacob separated the sheep that had just been born. Every mating period, Jacob made the flock of goats and sheep look towards the flocks that were mottled or dark-colored. so that the fur of animals that were then born became colored. In this way, he began to collect his own herds, separate from Laban's herd.
\v 41 When healthy goats and ewes were in heat, Jacob always placed the branches in the drinking trough in front of the herd, so that the goats and sheep would mate near the previously mentioned branches.
\v 42 However, Jacob did not put the branches in front of the unhealthy animals. Thus the animals born to unhealthy mothers became the property of Laban, and the animals born to healthy mothers became the property of Jacob.
\v 43 In this way, Jacob became very rich. He had very large herds, male and female slaves, camels and donkeys.
