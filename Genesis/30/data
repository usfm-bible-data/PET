\v 1 When Rahel realized that she was infertile, she felt jealous of her brother Leah. Then he said to Jacob, "Give me a child! If not, let me die! "
\p
\v 2 Hearing this, Jacob became very angry and said, "Am I God? Is that ?! He is the one who made you barren! Not me!"
\p
\v 3 Rachel answered, "This is my slave, Bilha! Take him and have sex with him, so that he will give birth to a child whom we will later consider to be the child I gave birth to. "

\v 5 Then Bilha conceived and gave birth to a son to Jacob.
\v 6 Then Rachel said, "God has justified me and heard my request. He has given me a son! "That is why he named the child. And \f + fr 30: 6 \fk And \ft The meaning of the name Dan is' He (LORD 
\ft) justifies, 'or' He judges '. \f *
\v 7 Then Bilha became pregnant again and gave birth to her second son.
\v 8 Then Rachel said, "I have fought against my brother, and in the end I won." That is why he named the child Naftali. \f + \fr 30: 8 \fk Naftali \ft Naftali's name can be interpreted as "my struggle" . \f *
\p
\v 9 When Leah realized that she had not been pregnant for a long time, she gave her slave Zilpa to her husband for marriage.
\v 10 Then Zilpa became pregnant and gave birth to a son to Jacob.
\v 11 Leah said, "I am really lucky." So he named the child Gad. \f + fr 30:11 \fk Gad \ft The name Gad means 'lucky' or 'luck'. \f *
\v 12 After that Zilpa gave birth to a son again.

\v 14 In the wheat harvest season, Reuben strolled and found the Mandragora plant \f + fr 30:14 \fk Mandragora \ft (called ‘dudaim’ in Hebrew) is a poisonous plant whose roots are believed to cure sterility. The root is also processed into a lust plant in the fields and takes it to his mother, Leah. Then Rachel said to Lea, "Can I ask for some mandragora brought by your child?"
\v 15 replied Leah, "Isn't it enough for you to take my husband? Now you still dare to ask for the mandragora fruit that my son brought to me ?! ”
\"Rachel replied," Then, in return, let tonight sleep with you, and give the mandragora fruit that your child brings to me. "
\p
\v 16 In the evening when Jacob returned from the field, Leah welcomed him and said, "Tonight you must relate to me, because I have given the root mandragora to Rachel as a payment, so that tonight you must relate to me." Jacob has sex with Leah.
\v 17 God answered Leah's prayer, and she became pregnant again and gave birth to her fifth son.
\v 18 So Leah said, "God has rewarded me because I have given my servant to my husband." That is why Lea named her son Isakar. \f + \fr 30:18 \fk Isakar \ft The name Isakar means 'award'. \f *
\v 19 Then Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son to Jacob.
\v 20 Then Leah said, "God has given me an extraordinary gift. This time my husband will surely respect me because I have given him six sons. "Therefore he gave the name of his son Zebulon. 
\F + \fr 30:20 \fk Zebulon \ft The name Zebulon can mean" honor ", or it reads like 'give praise' in Hebrew. \f *
\v 21 Time passed, and Leah gave birth to a daughter whom she named Dina.

\v 22 Then God remembered Rachel, and watched him. God allows Rachel to get pregnant.
\v 23 So Rachel got pregnant and gave birth to a son. Rahel said, "God has erased my shame."
\v 24 So he named his son Yusuf, \f + \fr 30:24 \fk Yusuf 
\ft. The name Joseph sounds like 'may He add' in Hebrew. \f * because he said, 'May the Lord give me a son man again.
\s1 Jacob's wealth increased
\p
\v 25 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob faced Laban and said, "Uncle, let me go back to my birthplace.
\v 26 Let me bring my wives and children - what I have because I have worked for you. Because you know that I've been working hard for you all this time. "
\p
\v 27 But Laban replied, "If you please, stay here. I already know through the prophecy that the Lord has blessed me because of you.
\v 28 Just say how much you want - I'm ready to pay. "
\p
\v 29 Jacob replied, "Uncle yourself knows how I have worked hard for you, and how your livestock herds are as long as I take care of them.
\v 30 Indeed, before my uncle's wealth came a little, but now your wealth has multiplied in number. God has blessed you wherever I work. So now it's time for me to work to meet the needs of my own family! "
\p
\v 31 Laban asked, "Then what should I give you to keep working for me here?"
\p Jacob replied, "Uncle does not need to give me anything. But if Uncle agrees with my proposal, then I will continue to take care of uncle's herds.
\v 32 Let me separate a part of your flock today, that is, every sheep that is speckled, striped or black. Let the separated animals - those speckled, striped or black haired, be my reward.
\v 33 So later Uncle can prove my honesty. One time Uncle could come and check my herd. If Uncle finds that there are among the animals I have separated, livestock whose fur is not speckled, has no spots or is not black, uncle has the right to assume that I stole the animals from you.
\p
\v 34 Answer Laban, "Alright, agree!"
\v 35 But on that day Laban separated the male and female goats whose spots were speckled and frayed, which were white and with black hair. He gave the animals the star animals to his sons to guard.
\v 36 Then the children took the flock away from Jacob and from the flocks of Laban's he still guarded. The distance between them and Jacob is three days.
\p
\v 37 Then Jacob cut branches from the blight tree, almond tree and chestnut tree, peeling some of the bark into the inside so that the branches looked white stripes.
\v 38 Then he put the branches beside the manger of drinking water, so that the cattle could see the branches when they came to drink. The animals usually mate when they come to drink.
\v 39 When flocks mate in front of striped branches, the fur of later animals becomes striped, speckled or mottled.
\v 40 Then Jacob separated the goats and ewes, from the Laban flock which he still grazed. Every mating period, Jacob confronts the flock of sheep with flocks that are colored or dark. The feathers of animals that are later born become colored. In this way, he began to collect his own herds — apart from the Laban herd.
\v 41 When a healthy goat and ewe are in heat, Jacob always places the branches at the animal drinking place, in front of the herd, so that the goats and sheep will mate near the branches.
\v 42 However, Jacob did not put the branches in front of unhealthy cattle. Thus the animals born of unhealthy mothers belong to Laban, and the stars born of healthy mothers belong to Jacob.
\v 43 In this way, Jacob became very rich. He had very large herds, male and female servants, camels and donkeys.\
