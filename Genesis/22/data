\c 22
\s1 Abraham's belief was tested
\p
\v 1 Some time later after all that had happened, God tested the extent to which Abraham believed and obeyed Him. So God said to Abraham, “Abraham!”
\p He answered, “Yes, Lord, it's me.”
\p
\v 2 Then God said, “Take your son Isaac— your one-and-only child who is dearly beloved— to the land of Moriah, and offer him to me as a burnt offering\f + \fr 22:2 \fk burnt offering \ft See the footnote at Gen. 8:20.\f* on one of the mountains which I will show you.”
\p
\v 3 So the next morning Abraham got up and prepared a firewood for the burnt offering, and he also put a saddle on the mid-part of a donkey.\f + \fr 22:3 \fk saddle … \ft The saddle mentioned would normally be made of cow hide. It could be that Abraham intended to ride the donkey, or prepared it to tie on cargo.\f* Then he took Isaac with two of his servants to go to the place that God had told him.
\v 4 On the third day of their journey, Abraham spread his gaze and saw where they were going.
\v 5 He said to his two servants, “Stay here with this donkey. I and Isaac will go there to worship the LORD, and then we will come back to you, here. "
\p
\v 6 So he put the wood on Issac's shoulder, while he himself carried the knife and the coals of fire. Then both went off together.
\v 7 Isaac said to his father, “Father!”
\p Abraham replied, “Yes, my son.”
\p Then Isaac said, “We have brought a firewood and a flame of fire to light a fire, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?”
\p
\v 8 Abraham said, “My son, God himself will provide the lamb for us as a burnt offering.” So they continued on their journey.
\p
\v 9 When they arrived at the place where God had said, Abraham built an altar there and set up firewood on it. Then he tied his son and laid him on the altar— on a firewood.
\v 10 So Abraham took a knife to sacrifice/kill him.
\v 11 But an angel called out to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!”
\p He answered, “Lord, this is me!”
\p
\v 12 And the angel spoke to Abraham, saying, “Do not do anything to your son. Now I know that you fully believe and obey me by giving up your only son— who you love so much, to Me.”
\p
\v 13 Then when Abraham looked near him he saw a ram whose horns were tangled in bushes. Then he took the ram, slaughtered it, and offered it to the Lord as a burnt offering. So the ram was slaughtered to replace Isak.
\v 14 And Abraham called the place, “The Lord provides what is needed.” And until now people still say, “In the LORD's mountain,\f + \fr 22:14 \fk LORD's mountain \ft Second Chronicles 3:1 says that Solomon built God's House at ‘Mount Moria’. (Compare with verse 2 in this chapter.)\f* He supplies what is needed.”
\p
\v 15 Then the angel called out the LORD's message from heaven to Abraham,
\v 16 “Because you have done this and refused to give up your only son to me, I swear by my own name
\v 17 that I will bless you and give many descendants to you— like the amount of the stars of heaven and the sand by the edge of the sea. They will win over all their enemies.
\v 18 Through your descendants I will bless all the races/nations of the earth, because you have obeyed My command.”
\p
\v 19 After that Abraham and Isaac went back to the two servants, then they went back to Beersheba and stayed there.
\s1 The sons of Nahor
\p
\v 20 Abraham had a brother named Nahor. After all these events, the news came to Abraham that Milcah Nahor's wife,\x + 22:20 \xt Kej. 11:26-30\x* already has eight sons.
\v 21 The firstborn son was Us, the second son Buz, and the third was Kemuel— who later became the father of Aram.
\v 22 The next sons were Kesed, Hazo, Pildas, Jidlaph and Bethuel.
\v 23 These were the eight sons that Milka bore for Nahor. Bethuel had a daughter named Rebekah who became the wife of Issac.
\v 24 Nahor also had a female servant whom he had made his second wife— namely Reuma. Nahor's sons with Reuma were Tebah, Gaham, Tahas and Ma'aka.
