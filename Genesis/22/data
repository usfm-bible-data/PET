\s1 Abraham's obedience was tested
\p
\v 1 Some time later after all that had happened, God tested the extent to which Abraham was obedient to Him. So God said to Abraham, “Abraham!”
\p He answered, “Yes, LORD, it's me.”
\p
\v 2 Then God said, “Bring Isaac— your one-and-only child who you love dearly— to the territory of Moriah, then offer him to Me as a burnt offering\f + \fr 22:2 \fk burnt offering \ft See the footnote at Gen. 8:20.\f* on one of the mountains which I will show you.”
\p
\v 3 So the next day, early in the morning, Abraham got up and prepared a firewood for the burnt offering, and he also put a saddle on the back of a donkey.\f + \fr 22:3 \fk saddle … \ft The saddle mentioned would normally be made of cow hide. It could be that Abraham intended to ride the donkey, or prepared it to tie on cargo.\f* Then he took Isaac with two of his slaves to go to the place that God had told him.
\v 4 On the third day of their journey, Abraham spread his gaze and saw the destination where they were going.
\v 5 Then he said to his two slaves, “Stay here with this donkey. I and Isaac will go there to worship the LORD, and then we will come back to you here. ”
\p
\v 6 So he put the firewood on Issac's shoulder, while he himself carried the knife and the fire.\f + \fr 22:6 \fk fire \ft It is not mentioned or explained in the Hebrew text how Abraham carried fire. But certainly he had a container that was filled with coals.\f* Then both went off together.
\v 7 Isaac said to his father, “Father!”
\p Abraham replied, “Yes, my child.”
\p Then Isaac said, “We have brought firewood and fire, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
\p
\v 8 Abraham answered, “My child, God himself will provide the lamb that is needed as a burnt offering for us.” So they continued on their journey.
\p
\v 9 When they arrived at the place where God had said, Abraham built an altar there and set up firewood on it. Then he tied his child and laid him on the altar— on top of firewood.
\v 10 After that Abraham took a knife to sacrifice him.
\v 11 But suddenly the LORD called out from heaven through His angel, “Abraham, Abraham!”
\p He answered, “Yes, LORD, it is me!”
\p
\v 12 At that time the LORD spoke from heaven through His angel to Abraham, saying, “Do not do anything to your child! Now I know that you fully believe and obey Me by giving up your only child who you love so much to Me.”
\p
\v 13 Then when Abraham looked behind, there was a ram whose horns were tangled in bushes. Then he took the ram, slaughtered it, and offered it to the LORD as a burnt offering. So the ram was slaughtered to replace Isaac.
\v 14 Then Abraham named the place, “The LORD provides what is needed.” And until now people still say, “In the LORD's mountain,\f + \fr 22:14 \fk LORD's mountain \ft In later days Mount Moria became the location of Jerusalem, where Solomon built the LORD's House as a place to give sacrifices to the LORD. (See 2Chron. 3:1.) Outside the wall of the city of Jerusalem is found the hill of Golgotha, where the Lord Jesus gave Himself as a perfect offering which fulfilled God's promises to the ancestors of the nation of Israel. Because of this, Abraham's words are considered a prophecy. Through Jesus, the LORD has supplied the saving sacrifice that was/is needed for all mankind.\f* He supplies what is needed.”
\p
\v 15 Then once again the LORD spoke from heaven to Abraham through His angel,
\v 16 “Because you have done this and not refused to give up your only son to Me, I swear by my own Name
\v 17 that I will bless you abundantly and will give many descendants to you, like the amount of the stars in the sky and sand by the seaside. They will win over all their enemies.
\v 18 Through your descendants I will bless all the races/nations of the earth, because you have obeyed My command.”
\p
\v 19 After that Abraham and Isaac went back to the two servants, then together they journeyed home to Beersheba together and stayed there.
\s1 The children of Nahor
\p
\v 20 Abraham had a brother named Nahor. After all these events, the news came to Abraham that Milcah— Nahor's wife,\x + 22:20 Gen\xt . 11:26-30\x* already had eight sons.
\v 21 The firstborn son was Us, the second son Buz, and the third was Kemuel— who later became the father of Aram.
\v 22-23 The next sons were Kesed, Hazo, Pildas, Jidlaph and Bethuel— who later had a daughter named Rebekah. These were the eight sons that Milka bore for Nahor.\x + \xo 22:23 \xt Gen. 24:15-67\x*
\v 24 Nahor also had a female servant whom he had made as his second wife— namely Reuma. Nahor’s four sons with Reuma were Tebah, Gaham, Tahas and Ma'aka.
