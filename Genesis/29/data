\s1 Jacob arrived at his uncle's house
\p
\v 1 Then Jacob continued his journey until he arrived at the land of the people east of Canaan.
\v 2 From a distance he saw a well with three flocks of sheep lying nearby. From that well the sheep will be given a drink. But at that moment the well was covered with a large rock.
\v 3 It is customary for shepherds in that place to wait until all the flocks are gathered, then the large stone is rolled to the side, then the flock is given a drink. After that the well will be closed again with the large stone.
\v 4 Jacob approached the shepherds who were there and said, "Gentlemen, where are you from?"
\p They answered, "We are from Haran."
\p
\v 5 Then Jacob asked again, "Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?"
\p Answer them, "Yes, we know him."
\p
\v 6 Then Jacob said, "How are you doing?"
\p They answered, "He is fine. Look, that's the son named Rachel. He is coming here with his father's sheep. "
\p
\v 7 Then Jacob said, "Okay, but it's still noon. It's not time to gather sheep to put in a cage. We recommend that these sheep be given a drink and then be led back to the field so they can continue to eat grass. "
\p
\v 8 But they answered, "You can't! After all the flocks gather here, then we can roll the stone over the well and drink to our sheep. "
\p
\v 9 When Jacob was still talking to them, Rachel arrived at the place while herding his father's sheep. "
\v 10 As Jacob saw his cousin Rachel — the son of his uncle Laban, his mother's brother, he approached and rolled the stone over the well. Then he gave drink to his uncle's sheep.
\v 11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel's right cheek and left cheek while crying in a loud voice, because she was very happy.
\v 12 Jacob told Rachel that they were cousins, because Laban was his mother's brother - Rebekah. Hearing that, Rachel ran home to tell her father - Laban.
\p
\v 13 As soon as Laban heard Jacob's arrival, he ran to meet him, then hugged and kissed Jacob on the cheek. Laban brought Jacob into his house, and Jacob told him everything that had happened to him.
\v 14 Then Laban said to him, "It's true, you are the blood of my flesh."
\s Jacob married Leah and Rachel
\p So Jacob stayed with Laban for even a month.
\v 15 Then Laban said to Jacob, "It is inappropriate for you to work for me without a salary just because we are still family. Say what salary you want. "
\p
\v 16 Laban has two daughters — namely Leah and Rachel.
\v 17 Lea eyes are sad, while Rachel has a beautiful body shape and beautiful appearance.
\v 18 Jacob has fallen in love with Rachel. Therefore he said, "I have been willing to work for you for seven years and as a payment, allow me to marry Rachel."
\p
\v 19 Answer Laban, "I'd better give Rachel to you than to anyone else! Stay here with me. "
\p
\v 20 So Jacob worked for seven years so he could marry Rachel. For Jacob, seven years was only a few days — because he loved Rachel.
\v 21 After seven years had passed, Jacob said to Laban, "My seven-year tenure is over. Now allow me to marry Rachel. "
\p
\v 22 So Laban invited everyone in that place, and held a big wedding.
\v 23 But that night, Laban brought his son Leah to Jacob, and Jacob had sex with him.
\v 24 Laban also gave a female servant named Zilpa to her son Lea to work as her servant.
\p
\v 25 The next morning, Jacob realized that the one with him that night was Leah. So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this! I worked seven years to get Rachel. But why did Uncle trick me? "
\p
\v 26 Answer Laban, "In our custom, a younger sister is not allowed to marry before her brother.
\v 27 First run the wedding celebration for Lea for one week, then I will give Rachel to you. But you have to promise to work for me for another seven years. "
\p
\v 28 Jacob fulfills Laban's request and runs a wedding celebration for Lea for one week. Then Laban also gave Rachel to Jacob for marriage.
\v 29 Laban also gave a slave girl named Bilha to Rachel to work as her slave.
\v 30 So Jacob also had sex with Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. Thus Jacob still lived and worked for Laban for another seven years.
\s1 Lea gave birth to four sons to Jacob
\p
\v 31 But because Jacob did not love Leah, then by the will of the Lord Leah became pregnant, while Rachel remained barren.
\v 32 Leah gave birth to a man and named him Reuben, because he said, "The Lord has seen my suffering. So now my husband must love me. "
\v 33 Then Lea became pregnant again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "The Lord has heard that I am not loved. Therefore the Lord gave me a son again. "So he named the child Simeon.
\v 34 Then Leah got pregnant again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Now my husband must be closer to me because I have given birth to three sons." So he named the child Levi.
\v 35 And Leah got pregnant again, then gave birth to a son. This time he said, "I will praise the Lord". So he named his son Judah. After that Leah did not give birth again.
