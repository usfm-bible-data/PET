\c 29
\s1 Jacob arrives at his uncle's house
\p
\v 1 Then Jacob continued his journey until he arrived at the land of the people east of Canaan.
\v 2 From a distance he saw a well with three flocks of sheep lying nearby. From that well the sheep were to drink. But at that moment the well was covered with a large rock.
\v 3 It was customary for shepherds in that place to wait until all the flocks are gathered, then the large stone was rolled to the side, then the flocks drank [passive: were allowed to drink]. After that the well would be closed again with the large stone.
\v 4 Jacob approached the shepherds who were there and said, “Brothers, where are you from?”
\p They answered, “We are from Haran.”
\p
\v 5 Then Jacob asked again, “Do you know Laban, the grandson of Nahor?”
\p They answered, “Yes, we know him.”
\p
\v 6 Then Jacob said, “How is he doing?”
\p They answered, “He is fine. Look, that's his daughter named Rachel. She is coming here with her father's sheep.”
\p
\v 7 Then Jacob said, “Okay, but it's still noon. It's not time to gather sheep to be put in the pens. It would be best that these sheep be given a drink and then be led back to the field so they can continue to eat grass.”
\p
\v 8 But they answered, “No way! After all the flocks gather here, then we roll the stone from the well and allow our sheep to drink.”
\p
\v 9 When Jacob was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived at the place leading her father's sheep.
\v 10 When Jacob saw his cousin Rachel— the daughter of his uncle Laban, his mother's brother— he rolled the stone from the well. Then he gave drink to his uncle's sheep.
\v 11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel's right and left cheek while crying in a loud voice, because she was very happy.
\v 12 Jacob told Rachel that they were cousins, because Laban was his mother Rebekah's brother. Hearing that, Rachel ran home to tell her father Laban.
\p
\v 13 As soon as Laban heard Jacob's arrival, he ran to meet him, then hugged and kissed Jacob on the cheek. Laban brought Jacob into his house, and Jacob told him everything that had happened to him.
\v 14 Then Laban said to him, “It's true, you are the blood of my flesh.”
\s Jacob married Leah and Rachel
\p So Jacob stayed with Laban for a full month.
\v 15 Then Laban said to Jacob, “It is inappropriate for you to work for me without a salary just because we are family. Say what salary you want.”
\p
\v 16 Laban has two daughters, namely Leah and her younger sister Rachel.
\v 17 Lea eyes were sad/tender, while Rachel had a beautiful body shape and beautiful appearance.
\v 18 Jacob has fallen in love with Rachel. Therefore he said, “I am willing to work for you for seven years and as a payment. Allow me to marry your younger daughter, Rachel.”
\p
\v 19 Laban answered, “I'd rather give Rachel to you than to anyone else! Stay here with me.”
\p
\v 20 So Jacob worked for seven years so he could marry Rachel. For Jacob, seven years was only a few days, because he very much loved Rachel.
\v 21 After seven years had passed, Jacob said to Laban, “My seven-year work period is over. Now allow me to marry Rachel.”
\p
\v 22 So Laban invited everyone in that place, and held a big wedding party.
\v 23 But that night, Laban brought his son Leah to Jacob, and Jacob had sex with her.
\v 24 Laban also gave a female slave named Zilpa to his daughter Lea to work as her slave.
\p
\v 25 The next morning, Jacob realized that the one with him that night was Leah. So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this?! I worked seven years to get Rachel. But why did you trick me?”
\p
\v 26 Laban answered, “By our customs, a younger sister is not allowed to marry before her older sister.
\v 27 Fulfill the wedding celebration for Lea for one week, then I will give Rachel to you. But you have to promise to work for me for another seven years.”
\p
\v 28 Jacob did according to Laban's request and fulfilled the wedding celebration for Lea for one week. Then Laban also gave Rachel to Jacob as his wife.
\v 29 Laban also gave a female slave named Bilha to Rachel to work as her slave.
\v 30 So Jacob also had sex with Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. Thus Jacob still lived and worked for Laban for another seven years.
\s1 Lea gave birth to four sons to Jacob
\p
\v 31 The LORD knew that Jacob did not love Leah, so the Lord permitted Leah to become pregnant, while Rachel remained barren.
\v 32 Leah gave birth to a boy and named him Reuben, because she said, “The Lord has seen my suffering. So now my husband must love me.”
\v 33 Then Leah became pregnant again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “The Lord has heard that I am not loved. Therefore the Lord gave me a son again.” So she named that son Simeon.
\v 34 Then Leah got pregnant again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now my husband must be closer to me because for him I have given birth to three sons.” So she named the child Levi.
\v 35 And Leah got pregnant again, then gave birth to a son. This time she said, “I praise the Lord!” So he named that son Judah. After that Leah did not give birth again.
