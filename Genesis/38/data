\s1 The Story of Judah and Tamar
\p
\v 1 At that time Judah left his brothers and lived with a person named Hirah, an Adullamite.
\v 2 There he met a Canaanite woman, the child of Shua. Then Judah married her and was one body with her.
\v 3 That woman conceived and birthed a boy child. Judah named that child Er.
\v 4 After that, she conceived again and birthed a boy child. Then she named that child Onan.
\v 5 Some time later, when Judah and his family had movedand lived in Chezib, the woman conceived again and birthed a boy child. She named the child Shelah.
\p
\v 6 When the first born of Judah (Er) was an adult, Judah married him to a woman named Tamar.
\v 7 But Er's behavior was very evil in the LORD’s eyes. Because of that the LORD took his life/soul.
\v 8 So Judah said to Onan, “Fulfill your responsibility to your older sibling Er's wife, as is usually done in our custom. Marry her so that the sons that are born first with her are considered to be a continuation of the line of descendants of your older sibling.\f + \fr 38:8 \fk ... continuation of the family line of your older sibling. \ft In the Hebrew text, there is no explanation about this custom, but this thing was generally done there. Because this is a foreign culture, the TSI has added this explanation.\f*”
\p
\v 9 But Onan knew that in that way, it meant that he would not be building his own line of descendants. So every time he was one body with Tamar, he intentionally spilled his sperm on the ground, so that Tamar didn't conceive.
\v 10 But in the eyes of the LORD Onan's deed was very evil. Because of that the LORD took his life/soul too.
\p
\v 11 Because of fear that the same thing would happen to Shelah, his youngest child, Judah said to Tamar, “Go home and live in your parents house as a widow, until Shelah is an adult." So Tamar returned to her parents house.
\p
\v 12 Some time later Judah's wife, the child of Shua died. After Judah passe the period of mourning, he went to Timna with Hirah— his friend from Adulam, to supervise the people who worked cutting his sheeps' fur.
\v 13 Tamar got news that Judah would arrive to Timna to cut sheeps' fur,
\v 14 Then Tamar knew that Shelah was already an adult but she had not been married to him. Because of that Tamar changed her widow's clothes, covered her head and face with a veil so that she was not recognized by people. Then she went and sat in front of the gate to the city of Enaim, on the side of the road that headed toward Timna.
\v 15 When Judah saw her, Judah thought that she was a prostitute because her face was covered with a veil.
\v 16 For he didn't know that that woman was his daughter-in-law. Judah just approached her and said, “I want to be one body with you.”
\p Tamar answered, “What will Father give to me as a reward?”
\p
\v 17 Judah said, “As a reward, I will give you one young goat.”
\p Then Tamar said, “What guarantee will Father give before I receive that goat kid?”
\p
\v 18 But Judah replied, “What guarantee do you want from me?"
\p Tamar replied “I request your ring stamp along with your necklace, and also your cane.” Judah fulfilled her request, and they were one body, and Tamar conceived.”
\v 19 After that, Tamar went home and took off her veil and put back on her widow's clothing.
\p
\v 20 A while later on, Judah asked his friend Hirah, the Adullamite, to take the goat kid to that woman, and take back the things he owned that had become his guarantee. But Hirah didn't find that woman.
\v 21 Hirah asked several people in that place, saying, “Where is the prostitute\f + \fr 38:21 \fk prostitute \ft The word ‘prostitute’ in verses 21-22 is different than in verse 15. In these two verses, the prostitute that is meant is a woman that sleeps with many men in the shape of qorship of a false god.\f* that is usually at the side of the road that heads toward Timnah, in front of the gate of the city of Enaim?”
\p But they answered, “There is no prostitute here like Brother is seeking.”
\v 22 So Hirah returned and explained to Judah, “I didn't find that prostitute. I asked people that were there, but they said, ‘There has never been a prostitute here.’”
\p
\v 23 Judah answered, “Alright. The important thing is that we tried to keep the promise by bringing a goat kid as her reward. Let her keep my things that became a guarantee. Because if we keep searching, we will become a laughing stock for people.”
\p
\v 24 About three months later, Judah got news that his daughter-in-law Tamar had acted as a prostitute, and she was pregnant outside of marriage. So Judah gruffly said, "Bring her out, and burn her for her deed!”
\p
\v 25 When Tamar was brought out to be killed, she ordered a person to deliver a message to Judah, her father-in-law, “The owner of these things, that is the ring stamp along with the his rope and this cane, is the person who got me pregnant. Does Father recognize the aforementioned things?”
\p
\v 26 Then Judah examined those things and said, “She is the one who is right! I didn't fulfill my promise to marry her to my child Shelah.” Then Judah never had intimate relations with her again.
\p
\v 27 When the time came for Tamar to give birth, actually she gave birth to twins.
\v 28 When she was in pain of labor, one of the babyies put out his hand. So the midwife who helped that labor, tied a red thread to that baby's hand. Then the midwife said, "This baby was born first."
\v 29 But that baby pulled his hand back and the other baby was born first. Then the midwife said, "How were you able to come out first?!" So the child was named Perez.\f + \fr 38:29 \fk Perez \ft which means he who breaks out.\f*
\v 30 After that the baby boy with the red thread on his arm was born. He was named Zerah.\f + \fr 38:30 \fk Zerah \ft In the Hebrew language this word has two meanings, that is red or light. \f*
