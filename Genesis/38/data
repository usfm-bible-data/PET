\s1 The Story of Judah and Tamar
\p
\v 1 At that time Judah left his brothers and lived with a person named Hirah, an Adullamite.
\v 2 There he met a Canaanite woman, the child of Shua. Then Judah married her and was one body with her.
\v 3 That woman conceived and birthed a boy child. Judah named him Er.
\v 4 After that, she conceived again and birthed a boy child. Then she named the child Onan.
\v 5 Some time later, when Judah and his family had moved to Chezib and lived there, the woman conceived again and birthed a boy child. She named him Shelah.
\p
\v 6 When the first born of Judah (Er) was an adult, Judah married him to a woman named Tamar.
\v 7 But Er's behavior was very evil in the LORD’s eyes. Because of that the LORD took his life.
\v 8 So Judah said to Onan, “Fulfill your responsibility to your older sibling Er's wife, as is usually done in our custom. Marry her so that your children that are born with her are considered to be heirs in the family line of your older sibling.”
\p
\v 9 But Onan knew that in that way, it meant that he would not be building his own line of descendants. So every time he was one body with Tamar, he intentionally spilled his sperm on the ground, so that Tamar didn't conceive.
\v 10 But in the eyes of the LORD what Onan did was very evil. Because of that the LORD took his life too.
\p
\v 11 Because of fear that the same thing would happen again to Shelah, his youngest child, Judah said to Tamar, “Go home and live in your parents house as a widow, until Shelah is an adult." So Tamar returned to her parents house.
\p
\v 12 Some time later Judah's wife, the child of Shua, died. And Judah mourned. But after that, Judah went to Timna with Hirah— his friend from Adulam, to supervise the people who were cutting his sheeps' fur.
\v 13 When Tamar got news that Judah was coming to Timna to cut his sheeps' fur,
\v 14 she changed her widow's clothes, and covered her head with a veil so that people didn't recognize her. Then she went and sat at the intersection of the road that headed to the village of Enaim, that headed toward Timna. She did that because up till then she hadn't yet been married to Shelah, but Shelah was already an adult.
\v 15 When Judah saw her, Judah thought that she was a prostitute because her face was covered with a veil.
\v 16 For he didn't know that she was his daughter-in-law. Judah just approached her and said, “I want to be one body with you.”
\p Tamar answered, “What will Father give to me as a reward?”
\p
\v 17 Judah said, “As a reward, I will give you one young goat.”
\p Then Tamar said, “What guarantee will Father give before I receive that goat kid?”
\p
\v 18 But Judah replied, “What guarantee do you want from me?" Tamar replied “I request your ring stamp along with your necklace, and also your cane.” Judah fulfilled her request, and the were one body, and Tamar conceived.”
\v 19 After that, Tamar went home and took off the veil that she wore, and put back on her widow's clothing.
\p
\v 20 A while later on, Judah asked his friend Hirah, the Adullamite, to take the goat kid to that woman, and take back the things he owned that had become his guarantee. But Hirah didn't find that woman.
\v 21 Hirah asked several people in that place, saying, “Where is the prostitute that is usually at the intersection of the road that heads toward the village of Enaim?”
\p But they answered, “There is no prostitute here like Brother is seeking.”
\v 22 So Hirah returned and explained to Judah, “I didn't find that prostitute. I asked people that were there, but they said, ‘There has never been a prostitute here.’”
\p
\v 23 Judah answered, “Alright. The important thing is that we tried to keep the promise by bringing a goat kid as her reward. Let her keep my things that became a guarantee. Because if not, we would become a laughing stock for people.”
\p
\v 24 About three months later, Judah got news that his daughter-in-law Tamar had acted as a prostitute, and she was pregnant outside of marriage. So Judah gruffly said, "Bring her out, and burn her for her deed!”
\p
\v 25 When Tamar was brought out to be killed, she ordered a person to deliver a message to her father-in-law Judah, “The owner of these things, that is the ring stamp along with the his rope and cane, is the person who got me pregnant. Do you recognize these things?”
\p
\v 26 Then Judah examined those things and said, “She is the one who is right! I didn't fulfill my promise to marry her to my child Shelah.” Then Judah didn't have intimate relations with her anymore.
\p
\v 27 When the time came for Tamar to give birth, she was startled because she evidently was giving birth to twins.
\v 28 When she was in pain of labor, one of the baby's put out his hand. So the midwife who helped that labor, tied a red thread to that baby's hand. Then the midwife said, "This baby was born first."
\v 29 But that baby pulled his hand back and the other baby was born first. Then the midwife said, "How could you come out first?!" So the child was named Perez—which means he broke out.
\v 30 After that the baby with the red thread on his arm was born. He was named Zerah.\f + \fr 38:30 \fk Zerah \ft In the Hebrew language it has the meaning of the red glow approaching sunset. \f*
