\s1 When God disrupted human language
\p
\v 1 Initially all mankind/humans on this earth spoke the same language.
\v 2 When they wandered eastward, they arrived on a plain— that is a land which was later called Babylon— and began to settle there.
\p
\v 3-4 Then they said to each other, “Come on, let's build a big city with a tower building that reaches the sky. We will use bricks and tar\f + \fr 11:3-4 \fk tar \ft See the footnote at Gen. 6:14.\f* for the adhesive material. Thus we will be famous and will not be dispersed over all the earth!”
\p
\v 5 But when they began to build the city and the tower, the LORD came down to see what the mortal humans were doing.
\v 6 The LORD said, “These people are one nation and speak the same language. If We let them do great things like this, then there will not be anything that they are incapable of doing.
\v 7 Let Us\f + \fr 11:7 \fk Us \ft See the footnote at Gen. 1:26.\f* go down there and confuse their language, so that they don't understand each other's words.”
\p
\v 8 That is how the Lord scattered them throughout the earth. Then they stopped building that city.
\v 9 That is why that city was called Babylon, which means ‘chaotic’, because that is where God disrupted human language throughout the earth so that people no longer only spoke in one language, but in many languages, and because from that place God scattered them over all the earth.
