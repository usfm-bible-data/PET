\c 12
\s1 God sent Abram to Canaan and promised to bless him
\p
\v 1 Then the Lord said to Abram, “Leave your land, your father's house, and your relatives. Go to the land that I will show you.
\q1
\v 2 I will bless you
\q2 and give you many descendants so that they became a large nation.
\q1 I will make your name known to many people
\q2 and you will be a blessing.
\v 3 I will bless the people who bless you
\q2 and cursed anyone who cursed you.
\q1 All the tribes-nations of the earth
\q2 will be blessed through you.”
\p
\v 4-5 At that time Abram was 75 years old.
\p So he and Sarai (his wife), and Lot (his nephew) left Haran, as the LORD had commanded him. He brought all the possessions and slaves they had gotten in Haran and went to Canaan.
\v 6 They traveled until they arrived at a place near Shechem— under a tree that was considered sacred\f + \fr 12:6 \fk trees which were considered sacred \ft The type of tree mentioned in the Hebrew is found in all the region of the Mediterranean Sea. It's characteristics, bears small fruit with seeds, can reach a height of 18 meters, has a big trunk, hard wood, and luxuriant leaves. In OT times, trees like these were often used as places to offer sacrifices to idols. \f* at More. At that time the Canaanites were still living in that land.
\p
\v 7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your descendants.” So Abram built an altar from stones at that place, to offer sacrifice(s) to the LORD who appeared to him.
\v 8 Then from Shechem, Abram and his family moved to the hill country to the east of Bethel. There they set up tents right between Bethel and Ai, so that from where they camped, Betel's position was west and Ai was on the east. At that place Abram built an altar again to offer sacrifices to the Lord and seek his help.
\v 9 Then they left that place and moved south of the land of Canaan, in the Negev.
\s1 Abram and Sarai went to Egypt for a while
\p
\v 10 Then there was famine in the land so that they were forced to go to Egypt and stay there for a while.
\v 11 When they were about to cross the border to enter Egypt, Abram said to Sarai, “My wife, you are a very beautiful woman.
\v 12 The problem is, if the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘She is his wife!’ Then to get you, they will kill me, while they will let you live.
\v 13 So it is better to tell them that you are my younger sister, that they will let me live and treat me well because of you.”
\p
\v 14 And that was true. Once they arrived, the people in Egypt saw that Sarai was very beautiful.
\v 15 When the officials of the land saw her, they came to the king of Egypt\f + \fr 12:15 \fk king of Egypt \ft Literally in MT (the Hebrew text) ‘Paroh’ and in the Indonesian language it is frequently pronounced Firaun/Pharaoh. Paroh/Pharaoh/Firaun is not a name, but the word in Egyptian which means ‘king’.\f* and praised her beauty in his presence. So at the command of the king, Sarai was taken into his palace.
\v 16 For the sake of getting Sarai, the king treated Abram well, so Abram was given many sheep, cows, donkeys and camels. The king also gave Abram several male and female slaves.
\p
\v 17 But because the king was [wanted/was about to] to marry Sarai, the Lord made the king and all the people in the palace experience serveral serious diseases.
\v 18 Finally the king realized the cause of the plague that was attacking people in his palace, and he called for Abram and said to him, “You have lied to me! Why did you not tell me that she is your wife?
\v 19 Why did you lie saying that she is your sister, so I took her to my wife ?! Now, take your wife and leave this place!”
\p
\v 20 So the king ordered his men to expel Abram from Egypt, taking his wife and all that he had.
