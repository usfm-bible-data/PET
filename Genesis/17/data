\c 17
\s1 The Lord renamed Abram to Abraham
\p
\v 1 When Abram was 99 years old, the LORD appeared to him again and said, “I am God Almighty. Serve me faithfully and live without fault.
\v 2 If you do that, I will ratify/confirm my official agreement which I previously made with you and I will make your descendants very numerous.”
\p
\v 3 So Abram bowed down with his face to the ground. Then God said to him,
\v 4 “I promise that you will become the father of many nations.
\v 5 Therefore your name is no longer Abram, but Abraham\f + \fr 17:5 \fk the names Abram and Abraham \ft The name ‘Abram’ means ‘honorable father’. While ‘Abraham’ means ‘father of many (people)’.\f* because I have determined/established you as the father of many nations.
\v 6 I will give you many of children and grandchildren, and make them become nations. Among them some will be kings.
\p
\v 7 I will ratify/confirm an covenant between Me and you. I will continue that covenant with your descendants from one generation to another forever. I will become your God and the God of your descendants.\f + \fr 17:7 \fk your God and the God of your descendants \ft This means there will be a special relationship between God and His people, and the people of Israel will worship God alone. The possessive form ‘-mu’ does not show the right of sole ownership for \ft the nation Israel.\f*
\v 8 I will give this land to you and to your descendants— namely all the land of Canaan where you are now living as sojourners. All these will become your children's and your grandchildren's forever. I will become their God.”
\s1 The Lord sets/ordains circumcision for men as a sign of the covenant
\p
\v 9-10 Then God said to Abraham, "As a sign that you and all your descendants through the generations agree to obey this covenant with Me, you must fulfill this requirement: Every man among you must be circumcised.
\v 11-12 From now on, this requirement/statute of mine will be in force generations after generations. Every baby boy in your families must be circumcised when aged one week.\f + \fr 17:11-12 \fk one week \ft Literally, ‘eight days’. If the baby boy was born on Monday, he was circumcised on Monday next. The way Jews calculate is to calculate the first day and the last day. So in the above example, the first and the last Monday is calculated, so the number is eight days.\f* Likewise with your male slaves, whether they are born in your home or you bought them from others. That circumcision will be a sign that you each have promised to obey the covenant between Me and you(pl).
\v 13 It does not matter whether the parents are members of your family or slaves you have bought. All male babies must be circumcised. This circumcision will be a reminder to each of you that you have promised to accept my covenant which will be continued for ever.
\v 14 Every man who is uncircumcised will no longer be considered as (one of) my people, because he has not obeyed my covenant.”
\s1 Changes to Sarah's name and God's promise to her
\p
\v 15 Then God said again to Abraham, “And concerning your wife Sarai, do not continue to call her Sarai, for now I have changed her name to Sarah.\f + \fr 17:15 \fk the name of Sarai and Sarah \ft The two names have the same meaning. Both can mean ‘princess’ or ‘queen’. Sarah’s new name, like Abraham’s name, became a reminder about what God would do for Sarah in the future.\f*
\v 16 I will bless her so that she will give birth to a son for you, and Sarah will be the mother of nations. Many of her offsprings will be kings.”
\p
\v 17 So Abraham bowed down with his face on the ground. But he laughed when he thought, “Could it be that I— who am 100 years old, will have a son?! And what about Sara, who is 90 years old?!”
\v 18 Then he said to God, “Oh LORD, it is just better for Ishmael to become my heir.”
\p
\v 19 But God said, “No! Sarah will give birth to a son for you. Name the boy Isaac. I will cause him and his descendants to inherit my covenant for ever. [word order more like: I will bequeath my covenant to …]
\v 20 As for your request for Ishmael, I have granted it. I will bless him so he also will have many descendants. I will make his offsprings into a great nation, and twelve of his offsprings will rule over twelve nations.
\v 21 But I will establish my official covenant with Isaac. He will be birthed by Sara one year from now.”
\v 22 After God finished talking to Abraham, He left him.
\p
\v 23 On that same day Abraham circumcised Ishmael and all the men who were in his house, including the sons of the slaves he had bought. He did as God had commanded him.
\v 24 Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised,
\v 25 Ishmael was 13 years old when Abraham circumcised him.
\v 26-27 All the men in Abraham’s family— whether born in his house or bought from foreigners, were circumcised together with them on the same day.
