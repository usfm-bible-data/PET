\c 21
\s Isak was born
\p
\v 1 The Lord blessed Sara and fulfilled His promise as He had said.
\v 2 Then Sarah conceived, and gave birth to a son to Abraham — exactly at the time God had promised Abraham.\x + \xo 21:2 \xt Gen. 18:10\x* At that time Abraham was very old.
\v 3 Then Abraham named the child Isaac.
\v 4 After Isaac is one week old,\f + \fr 21:4 \fk one week old \ft See the footnote at Gen. 17:11.\f* Abraham circumcised him as how God had commanded him.
\v 5 At that time Abraham was 100 years old.
\p
\v 6 Then Sara said, “Because of what God has done for me, I laugh! And everyone who hears about this incident will also be joyful and laugh!”\f + \fr 21:6 \fk laugh \ft In Hebrew the sound of the pronunciation of ‘laugh’ is almost the same sound as ‘Isaac’, that is ‘Yitshak’. In Gen. 18:12, Sarah laughed because she doubted the LORD's promise. Now the LORD makes her laugh again. But this time, she laughs out of joy because of the birth of her child.\f*
\v 7 And again she said, “Not even a person would have thought that I would have a child for Abraham. But now I have given birth to a child for him in his old age.”
\s1 Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away
\p
\v 8 Then the child got bigger. When he was three years old, the time came when he was separated from his mother's milk. That day Abraham held a big party to celebrate.
\v 9 Then Sarah saw Hagar's\x + \xo 21:9 \xt Gen. 16:1\x* child, Ishmael, making fun of Isak.\f + \fr 21:9 \fk making fun of … \ft The word in the Hebrew text translated ‘making fun of’ can also mean ‘playing with’.\f*
\v 10 Because of that Sarah said to Abraham, “Drive away the Egyptian woman and her child! The child of that slave must not become an heir together with my son— Isaac!”
\p
\v 11 That made Abraham's heart sad, because after all Ishmael was also his child.
\v 12 But God said to Abraham, “Do not be sad at heart because of Ishmael and Hagar. Do according to Sarah's words, for it is through Isaac that I will give the descendants I have promised you.
\v 13 Even so, I will also make the child of your slave the ancestor of a great nation, because he is also your child.”
\p
\v 14 Abraham got up very early morning, took food and a large drink container full of water. The drink container was made of animal skin.\f + \fr 21:14 \fk drink container … \ft Often such drink containers were made of the bladder of cattle.\f* He gave all of that and placed them on Hagar's shoulders, and ordered them to leave. So Hagar and Ishmael went wandering in the wilderness near Beersheba.
\p
\v 15 After the water in the skin pouch ran out, Hagar left her child under a small tree.
\v 16 Then she went about a 100 meters away\f + \fr 21:16 \fk about 100 meters away \ft Literally, ‘about a bow shot away’. The meaning is, as far as an arrow is shot.\f* from that place. She said in her heart, “I can't bear to see my child die.” So she sat there and cried loudly.
\p
\v 17 Then an angel\f + \fr 21:17 \fk angel \ft Literally, ‘angel of God’. Normally all angels are considered as coming from God. Because of this, when the original text of the OT and NT write ‘angel of God’, the TSI translates ‘angel’. The source languages of the Bible mention ‘angel of God’ because there were angels who followed the devil when he rebelled against God. But Indonesian people always refer to those angels who joined the devil as evil spirits or demons.\f* said from heaven to Hagar, “Don't cry, Hagar! Don't be afraid, because God has heard the cry of your child.
\v 18 Get up! Help your child to stand and guide him to walk. Because I have promised that Ishmael will become the ancestor of a great nation.”
\p
\v 19 Then God made Hagar see a well located not far from the place. So she went and filled the skin pouch with water, then gave the child a drink.
\p
\v 20 God was with that child. He became an adult and lived in the wilderness of Paran, and became a highly skilled archer.
\v 21 Hagar chose a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
\s1 Abraham and Abimelech made an official agreement
\p
\v 22 At that time King Abimelech\f + \fr 21:22 \fk King Abimelech \ft See footnote on Gen. 20:2.\f* and his war general named Pikol came to Abraham and said, “It is clear that God always blesses all your efforts.
\v 23 So, let us make an official agreement before God that you/Sir and all your descendants will always be honest to me and to all of my descendants later. As how I have done good to you/Sir, so also you/Sir must promise to do good to me and to all the people in this country you live in.”
\p
\v 24 So Abraham said, “Alright, I promise!”
\v 25 Even though before this, Abimelech's slaves had seized a well that Abraham’s slaves had dug. Because of that Abraham expressed his disappointment to Abimelek about that.
\p
\v 26 Abimelech said, “I do not know who did that. You did not tell me before, and I just knew about it today.”
\p
\v 27 Then Abraham gave Abimelech a few sheep and cattle. Then they both made an official agreement.
\v 28 After that Abraham separated seven ewes from his flock.
\v 29 Abimelech asked him, “What are the seven ewes for?”
\p
\v 30 Abraham answered, “Receive these seven ewes from me as a sign that you acknowledge that I dug this well, and I have the right to use it.”
\v 31 That is why the place is named
\p Beerseba because the two of them had made a covenant there.\f + \fr 21:31 \fk Beerseba \ft In Hebrew ‘beer’ means ‘well’. While the sound of the pronunciation of ‘seba’ in Hebrew sounds similar with words that mean ‘seven’ and ‘covenant’.\f*
\v 32 After making the agreement at Beersheba, Abimelech and his war general Picol returned to their city in the Philistines territory.
\p
\v 33 Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree there as a sign for remembrance, and there he worshiped the LORD, the eternal God.
\v 34 After that Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines as an immigrant resident for quite a long time.
