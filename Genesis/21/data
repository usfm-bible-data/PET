\c 21
\s Isak was born
\p
\v 1 The Lord blessed Sara and fulfilled His promise as He had said.
\v 2 Then Sarah conceived, and gave birth to a son to Abraham — just at the time God had promised Abraham.\x + \xo 21:2 \xt Gen. 18:10\x* At that time Abraham was very old.
\v 3 Then Abraham named the child Isak.
\v 4 At one week old,\f + \fr 21:4 \fk one week old \ft See the footnote at Gen. 17:11.\f* Abraham circumcised Isaac as God had commanded him.
\v 5 At that time Abraham was a hundred years old.
\p
\v 6 Then Sara said, “Because of what God has done for me, I laugh! And everyone who hears about this incident will also be joyful and laugh!”\f + \fr 21:6 \fk laugh \ft In Hebrew the sound of the pronunciation of ‘laugh’ is almost the same sound as ‘Isak’. In Gen. 18:12, Sarah laughed because she doubted the LORD's promise. Now the LORD makes her laugh again. But this time, she laughs for joy and the birth of her son.\f*
\v 7 And again she said, “No one thought that I would have a child for Abraham. But now I have given birth to a child for him in his old age.”
\s1 Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away
\p
\v 8 Then the child got bigger. When he was three years old, the time came when he was separated from his mother's milk. That day Abraham held a big party to celebrate about him.
\v 9 One day Sara saw Hagar's child— Ishmael, making fun of Isak.\f + \fr 21:9 \fk making fun of … \ft The word in the Hebrew text translated ‘making fun of’ can also mean ‘playing with’.\f*
\v 10 Because of that Sara said to Abraham, “Drive away the woman from Egypt and her child! The child of the slave must not become an heir together with my son— Isak!”
\p
\v 11 That made Abraham's heart sad, because after all Ishmael was his son.
\v 12 But God said to Abraham, “Do not be sad at heart because of your son Ishmael and your servant Hagar. Do according to Sarah's words, for it is through Isaac that I will give the offspring I have promised you.
\v 13 Even so, I will also make the son of your servant the ancestor of a great nation, because he is also your child.”
\p
\v 14 Abraham got up in the very early morning, took food and a large drink container full of water. The drink container was made of animal skin.\f + \fr 21:14 \fq drink container … \ft Often such drink containers were made of the bladder of cattle.\f* He gave all that and placed them on Hagar's shoulders, and ordered them to leave. So Hagar and Ishmael went wandering in the wilderness near Beersheba.
\p
\v 15 After the water from the bottle ran out, Hagar left her child under some bushes.
\v 16 Then she went about a 100 meters away.\f + \fr 21:16 \fk about 100 meters away \ft Literally, ‘about a bow shot away’.\f* She said to herself, “I can't stand seeing my son die.” So she sat there and cried loudly.
\p
\v 17 But God heard the boy's voice, then one of the angels said from heaven to Hagar, “Don't cry, Hagar! Don't be afraid, because God has heard the cry of your child.
\v 18 Go to him. Help him stand and comfort him. Because I promise that he will become the ancestor of a great nation.”
\p
\v 19 Then Allah made it so Hagar could see clearly, so that she saw a well located not far from the place. So she went and filled the bottle with water, then gave the child a drink.
\p
\v 20 God was with that child, until he became an adult. He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and became a highly skilled archer.
\v 21 Hagar chose a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
\s1 Agreement between Abraham and Abimelek
\p
\v 22 At that time King Abimelek and his war general (named Pikol) came to Abraham and said, “It is clear that God always blesses all your efforts.
\v 23 So promise me now before God that you and all your descendants will always be honest with me and to all of my descendants later. As I have done good to you, so also you must promise to do good to me and to all the people in this country you live in.”
\p
\v 24 So Abraham said, “Alright, I promise!”
\v 25 Then Abraham expressed his disappointment at the loss he had suffered because Abimelek's servants had forbidden his servants to draw water from the well they had dug.
\p
\v 26 Abimelek said, “I do not know who did that to you.”
\p
\v 27 Then Abraham gave Abimelech several sheep and cattle. Then they both made an agreement.
\v 28 After that Abraham separated seven ewes from his flock.
\v 29 Abimelek asked him, “What are the seven ewes for?”
\p
\v 30 Abraham answered, “Receive these seven lambs from me as a sign that you acknowledge that I dug this well, and I have the right to use it.”
\v 31 Then Abimelek agreed. The place was named Beerseba because they had made a covenant there.\f + \fr 21:31 \fk Beerseba \ft In Hebrew ‘beer’ means ‘well’. While the sound of the pronunciation of ‘seba’ in Hebrew sounds similar with words that mean ‘seven’ or ‘covenant’.\f*
\v 32 After making an agreement at Beersheba, Abimelek and Pikol (his war general) returned to the land of the Philistines.
\p
\v 33 Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree there as a sign for remembering, and there he worshiped the Eternal LORD.
\v 34 After that Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines as an immigrant resident for quite a long time.
