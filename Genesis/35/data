\c 35
\s1 Jacob returns to Bethel
\p
\v 1 God said to Jacob, “Get ready and return to Bethel, where I met with you at the time you ran away from your brother Esau. Make an altar to Me there, and stay there.”
\p
\v 2 So Jacob said to all of the members of his family and to everyone who was with him, “Get rid of all of the idol statues of other peoples that you have. Cleanse yourselves, then put on clean clothes.\f + \fr 35:2 \fk Clean … \ft This is the first time a custom of cleansing like this is mentioned before coming into the presence of the LORD, or just entering into the encampment of Israel. In later days the people of Israel would be given statutes about the steps for what is called ‘purification’ of oneself. The word that is translated ‘Cleanse’ in this verse can also be translated ‘Purify’, but the meaning is of course ritual and external purification. See an example in Leviticus 17:15-16.\f*
\v 3 Lets get ready and go to Bethel. I will make an altar there to God, who has always helped me when I faced difficulties, and has always been with me wherever I go.”
\p
\v 4 Then they surrendered to Jacob all of the foreign idol statues that they had, and also earrings that were in their ears.\f + \fr 35:4 idols and earrings \ft It is quite possible Jacob avoided the perception that his family killed all of the males in Shechem in order to take their possessions. Earrings— at the time were worn both by men and women— were very visible. So wealth like that was hidden. The idols mentioned most likely included things that were taken from Shechem, and maybe also the gods that were stolen by Rachel from Laban's house (Gen. 31). Among their large group, including captives and slaves, there were certainly those who still believed in idols. But the idols that they hid in the hole in the ground beneath the large oak tree were not worshiped by them any more.\f* Then Jacob buried all of those things beneath a large oak tree that was near the city of Shechem.
\v 5 At the time Jacob and his family group departed, a feeling of fear from God enveloped all of the citizens in the surrounding cities, so that there was not even one person who was bold to chase them.
\v 6 So they arrived in a place called Luz, that is called Bethel, in Canaan.\x + \xo 35:6 \xt Gen. 28:19\x*
\v 7 There Jacob made an altar and named that place El-Bethel,\f + \fr 35:7 \fk El-Bethel \ft The meaning of El-Bethel is ‘God of Bethel’.\f* because there God had revealed himself to him at the time he ran away from Esau, his older brother.
\p
\v 8 In that place also Deborah, Rebekah's caregiver, died and was buried beneath an tree that was considered sacred. Since then, that tree is named ‘Allon-Bacuth’\f + \fr 35:8 \fk Allon-Bacuth \ft The meaning of Allon-Bacuth is ‘tree of mourning’.\f*.
\p
\v 9 When Jacob returned from Padan Aram, God met him again and blessed him.
\v 10 God said to him,
\mi “Your name is Jacob of course, but from now on I'm giving a new name to you. You will be known by the name Israel.
\v 11 I the Almighty God bless you, so that you have many children and grandchildren. People groups will be born from your descendants and you will be the ancestor of kings.
\v 12 The land I've given to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you and to your descendants.”
\m
\v 13 After God finished speaking to Jacob, He returned to heaven.
\p
\v 14 Then Jacob raised up a rock as a reminder that at that place God had spoken to him. Then Jacob poured an offering [water] of wine and olive oil on top of it as a poured-out/drink offering.\f + \fr 35:14 \fk poured-out offering \ft In Hebrew, literally, ‘liquid/drink offering’. Jacob made the offering because he wanted to thank God because of the great promise that He had conveyed, and perhaps also in this way he dedicated that rock as a memorial.\f*
\v 15 And Jacob named that place Bethel,\f + \fr 35:15 \fk Bethel \ft The meaning of Bethel is ‘house of God’.\f* because there God had spoken to him.
\s1 Rachel died when she gave birth
\p
\v 16 Then they left Bethel and continued to travel toward Ephrath. But before arriving in Ephrath, Rachel felt the pain of labor. And the labor was very difficult.
\v 17 At the most difficult moment of the labor, the midwife said to her, “Don't be afraid, because you have given birth to a son.”
\v 18 And while Rachel breathed her last breath, she named her child that was just born Ben-Oni\f + \fr 35:18 \fk Ben-Oni \ft The meaning of the name Ben-Oni is ‘child of my suffering’.\f*, but Jacob named him Benjamin.\f + \fr 35:18 \fk Benjamin \ft The meaning of the name Benjamin is ‘child of profit for me’ or ‘child of my right hand’.\f*
\v 19 After Rachel died, she was buried by the side of the road going to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
\v 20 Jacob raised a memorial stone at her grave, and that stone is still there now.
\p
\v 21 After that, Israel (that is Jacob) continued his journey until the part south of the tower of Eder and he set up his camp there.
\v 22 While Jacob was there, Reuben slept with Bilhah, Rachel's slave who was taken to become Jacob's wife. That news reached Jacob.
\s1 Jacob's sons
\p These are the twelve sons of Jacob:
\li1
\v 23 The children with Leah are Reuben (the firsborn child), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Isachar, and Zebulon.
\li1
\v 24 The children with Rachel are Joseph and Benjamin.
\li1
\v 25 The name of Jacob’s first son with Bilhah, Rachel's slave, was Dan. The second son was named Naphtali.
\li1
\v 26 And the children with Zilpah, Leah's slave, are Gad and Asher.
\p Those were all the sons of Jacob that where born in Padan Aram.
\s1 Isaac died
\p
\v 27 Then Jacob returned to Isaac, his father, at Mamre which is also called Kiriath-Arba and now is known as Hebron. His grandfather (Abraham) lived there earlier.
\v 28-29 Isaac died at 180 year of age. Then the LORD placed him together with his ancestors who had died. Esau and Jacob buried him.
