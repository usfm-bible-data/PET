\c 35
\s1 Jacob and his family return to Bethel
\p
\v 1 God said to Jacob, “Get ready and return to Bethel— the place where I revealed myself to you at the time you ran away from your brother Esau. Make and altar to me there, and stay in that place.”
\p
\v 2 So Jacob said to all of the members of his family and to everyone who was with him, “Get rid of all of the statues worshipped by other peoples that you have. Purify yourselves and change your clothing to clean clothes.
\v 3 Lets get ready and go to Bethel. I will make an Altar there to God— who has always helped me when facing difficulties, and has always been with me wherever I go.”
\p
\v 4 Then they surrendered to Jacob all of their wealth in the form of foreign idols that were found among them, and also earrings that were in their ears.\f + \fr 35:4 idols and earrings\ft It is quite possible Jacob avoided the perception that his family killed all of the males in Shechem in order to take their possessions. Earrings (at the time these were used both by men and women) were very visible. So wealth like that was hidden. The idols mentioned most likely included things that were taken from Shechem, and maybe also the gods that were stolen by Rachel from Laban's house (Gen. 31). Among their large group— including captives and slaves, there were certainly those who still believed in idols. But the idols that they hid in the hole in the ground beneath the large oak tree were not worshiped by them any more.\f* Then Jacob buried all of those things beneath a large oak tree that was near the city of Shechem.
\v 5 At the time Jacob and his family group departed, a feeling of fear from God enveloped all of the citizens in the surrounding cities, so that not even one person was bold to chase them.
\v 6 So they arrived in a place called Luz, and in the land of Canaan— that is now called Bethel.
\v 7 There Jacob made an altar and named it El-Bethel— meaning ‘God of Bethel’, because in that place God had revealed himself to him at the time he ran away from his older brother Esau.
\p
\v 8 In that place also Deborah— Rebekah's caregiver, died and was buried beneath an oak tree. But since then that tree was named ‘Allon-Bacuth’— which means ‘Tree of mourning’.
\p
\v 9 When Jacob returned from Padan Aram, God revealed himself again to him and blessed him.
\v 10 God said to him,
\mi “Your name is Jacob of course, but from now on I'm giving you a new name. You will be known by the name Israel.
\v 11 I, the Almighty God, bless you— so that you have many children and grandchildren. From your descendants people groups will be born and you will be the ancestor of kings.
\v 12 The land I've given to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and to your descendants.
\m
\v 13 After God said that to Jacob, He returned to heaven.
\p
\v 14 Then Jacob raised up a rock as a reminder that at this place God had spoken to him. Then Jacob poured an offering of oil and wine on top of it as a poured-out/drink offering.\f + \fr 35:14 \fk poured-out offering \ft The word ‘nasek’ in the Hebrew language means ‘liguid/drink offering’. Certainly Jacob wanted to thank God because of the great promise He had delivered, and maybe at once the offering dedicated that rock of remembrance.\f*
\v 15 And Jacob named that place Bethel— which means ‘house of God’, because God had spoken to him there.
\s1 Rachel died when she gave birth
\p
\v 16 Then they left Bethel and continued to travel toward Ephrath. But on the journey when they had almost arrived in Ephrath, Rachel felt the pain of childbirth. And the proscess of birthing was very difficult.
\v 17 At the most difficult moment of the birth proscess, the midwife said to her, “Don't be afraid, because you have given birth to a son.”
\v 18 And at almost the same time Rachel breathed her last breath, she named her child that was just born Ben-Oni which means child of my suffering, but Jacob named him Benjamin which means child of my fortune.
\v 19 After Rachel died, she was buried by the side of the road going to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
\v 20 At her grave Jacob raised a memorial stone, and that stone is still there now.
\p
\v 21 After that, Israel (that is Jacob) continued his journey with his family until the part south of the tower of Eder. They camped there for some time.
\v 22 While Jacob was there, Reuben slept with Bilhah— that is Rachel's servant who was taken to become Jacob's wife. That news reached Jacob's ears.
\s1 Jacob's children
\p These are the twelve sons of Jacob:
\li1
\v 23 The children with Leah are Reuben (the firsborn child, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Isachar, and Zebulon.
\li1
\v 24 The children with Rachel are Joseph and Benjamin.
\li1
\v 25 The children with Bilhah— Rachel's slave, are Dan and Naphtali.
\li1
\v 26 And the children with Zilpah— Leah's slave, are Gad and Asher.
\p Those are the children of Jacob that where born in Padan Aram.
\s1 Isaac died
\p
\v 27 Then Jacob returned to his father, Isaac, at Mamre— which is also called Kiriath-Arba, and now is known as Hebron. His grandfather (Abraham) lived there earlier.
\v 28-29 At 180 year of age, Isaac breathed his last breath, joining his forefathers that had preceded him. Then his two sons— Esau and Jacob buried him.
