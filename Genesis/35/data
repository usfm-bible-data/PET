\c 35
\s1 Jacob and his family return to Bethel
\p
\v 1 God said to Jacob, “Get ready and return to Bethel— the place where I revealed myself to you at the time you ran away from your brother Esau. Make and altar to me there, and stay in that place.”
\p
\v 2 So Jacob said to all of the members of his family and to everyone who was with him, “Get rid of all of the idols that you have. Purify yourselves and change your clothing to clean clothes.
\v 3 Lets get ready and go to Bethel. I will make an Altar there to God— who has always helped me when facing difficulties, and has always been with me wherever I go.”
\p
\v 4 Then they surrendered to Jacob all of their wealth in the form of idols that were found among them, and also earrings that were in their ears.\f + \fr 35:4 idols and earrings\fk  \ft It is quite possible Jacob avoided the perception that his family killed all of the males in Shechem in order to take their possessions. Earrings (at the time these were used both by men and women) were very visible. So wealth like that was hidden. The idols mentioned most likely included things that were taken from Shechem, and maybe also the gods that were stolen by Rachel from Laban's house (Gen. 31). Among their large group— including captives and slaves, there were certainly those who still believed in idols. But the idols that they hid in the hole in the ground beneath the large oak tree were not worshiped by them any more.\f* Then Jacob buried all of those things beneath a large oak tree that was near the city of Shechem.
\v 5 At the time Jacob and his family group departed, a feeling of fear from God enveloped all of the citizens in the surrounding cities, so that not even one person was bold to chase them.
\v 6 So they arrived in Luz, and in the land of Canaan— that is now called Bethel.
\v 7 There Jacob made an altar and named it El-Bethel— meaning ‘God of Bethel’, because in that place God had revealed himself to him at the time he ran away from his older brother Esau.
\p
\v 8 In that place also Deborah— Rebekah's caregiver, died and was buried beneath an oak tree. But since then that tree was named ‘Allon-Bacuth’— which means ‘Tree of mourning’.
\p
\v 9 When Jacob returned to Padan Aram, God revealed himself again to him and blessed him.
\v 10 God said to him,
\mi “Your name is Jacob of course, but from now on I'm giving you a new name. You will be known by the name Israel.
\v 11 I, the Almighty God, bless you— so that you have many children and grandchildren. From your descendants people groups will be born and you will be the ancestor of kings.
\v 12 The land I've given to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and to your descendants.
\m
\v 13 After God said that to Jacob, He returned to heaven.
\p
\v 14 Then Jacob raised up a rock as a reminder that at this place God had spoken to him. Then Jacob poured an offering of oil and wine on top of it as a sign of thanksgiving to God.\f + \fr 35:14 offering\fk  … as … \ft The word ‘nasek’ in the Hebrew language means ‘liguid/drink offering’. Certainly Jacob wanted to thank God because of the great promise He had delivered, and maybe at once the offering dedicated that rock of remembrance.\f*
\v 15 And Jacob named that place Bethel— which means ‘house of God’, because God had spoken to him there.
\s1 Rachel died when she gave birth
\p
\v 16 Kemudian mereka meninggalkan Betel dan melanjutkan perjalanan menuju Efrata. Tetapi dalam perjalanan ketika mereka hampir tiba di Efrata, Rahel merasakan sakit menjelang persalinan. Dan proses persalinannya pun sangat sulit.
\v 17 Pada saat yang paling sulit dalam proses persalinannya, bidan berkata kepadanya, “Jangan takut, karena kamu melahirkan lagi seorang anak laki-laki.”
\v 18 Dan hampir bersamaan Rahel menghembuskan napas terakhirnya, dia menamai anaknya yang baru lahir itu Ben-Oni yang artinya anak penderitaanku, tetapi Yakub menamainya Benyamin yang artinya anak keberuntungan.
\v 19 Sesudah Rahel meninggal, dia dikuburkan di pinggir jalan menuju Efrata, yaitu Betlehem.
\v 20 Di kuburannya itu Yakub mendirikan sebuah batu peringatan, dan batu itu masih ada sampai sekarang.
\p
\v 21 Sesudah itu, Israel (yaitu Yakub) meneruskan perjalanannya bersama keluarganya melewati selatan menara Eder. Mereka berkemah di sana untuk beberapa waktu.
\v 22 Ketika Yakub sedang berada di sana, Ruben tidur dengan Bilha— yaitu hamba Rahel yang diambil menjadi istri Yakub. Berita itu pun sampai ke telinga Yakub.
\s1 Anak-anak Yakub
\p Inilah keduabelas anak laki-laki Yakub:
\li1
\v 23 Anak-anaknya dengan Lea adalah Ruben (anak yang sulung), Simeon, Lewi, Yehuda, Isakar dan Zebulon.
\li1
\v 24 Anak-anaknya dengan Rahel adalah Yusuf dan Benyamin.
\li1
\v 25 Anak-anaknya dengan Bilha— budak Rahel, adalah Dan dan Naftali.
\li1
\v 26 Dan anak-anaknya dengan Zilpa— budak Lea, adalah Gad dan Asyer.
\p Itulah anak-anak Yakub yang lahir di Padan Aram.
\s1 Isak meninggal dunia
\p
\v 27 Maka Yakub kembali ke rumah bapaknya, Isak, di Mamre— yang juga disebut Kiriat-Arba, yang sekarang dikenal dengan Hebron. Kakeknya (Abraham) dahulu menetap di sana.
\v 28-29 Pada usia 180 tahun, Isak menghembuskan nafas terakhirnya, bergabung dengan nenek moyangnya yang sudah mendahuluinya. Lalu kedua anaknya— Esau dan Yakub, menguburkannya.
