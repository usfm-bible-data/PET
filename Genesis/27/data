\c 27
\s Isaac blessed Jacob
\p
\v 1 When Isak was old and could not see again, he called Esau, his eldest son, and said,"My child!"
\Answer Esau,"Yes, Father!"
\p
\v 2 Then Isak said,"I am old, and the day of my death is drawing near.
\v 3-4 Take your weapon - the arrow and the arrow tube, and go hunting for the animals in the field. Cook the meat from the game well, like I like. Then bring it here for me to eat, so that I can bless you before I die."
\p
\v 5 When Isak spoke to Esau, Rebekah heard that. So when Esau went hunting,
\v 6 Rebekah said to Jacob,"I have heard your father speak to Esau.
\v 7 The father told your sister to go hunting, and the meat from the game was cooked, so that before your father died, he could bless Esau before the Lord.
\v 8 My child, now do what I tell you.
\v 9 Go and choose the two best goats from the herd, bring them here so that I can cook the meat as your father likes.
\v 10 Then bring the food to your father to eat, so that your father will bless you before he dies."
\p
\v 11 Jacob replied,"Mother, my sister Esau's body is hairy, whereas I am not.
\v 12 What will happen if you feel like me ?! He would soon know that I was not Esau and also knew that I was trying to deceive him. So I will definitely not be blessed by you, on the contrary, I will be cursed."
\p
\v 13 Rebekah replied,"If this happens, let your mother bear the curse of your father. Now listen to my words: go and take the goat, and immediately bring it here."
\p
\v 14 Jacob followed according to what his mother ordered. He left and returned with a goat. Then his mother immediately prepared a very tasty meal, which Isak liked very much.
\v 15 Then Rebekah took Esau's very good clothes, which were kept in her house, and gave them to Jacob to use.
\v 16 He also covered Jacob's arms and neck with young goat skin,
\v 17 and gives delicious meat dishes and freshly baked bread to him.
\p
\v 18 Then Jacob faced his father, and said,"Father, it's me." Isak asked,"Who are you, or is it Jacob?"
\p
\v 19 Jacob answered,"I am Esau, your firstborn child. I've done everything you asked. Sit down and enjoy the game I have cooked, so you can bless me."
\p
\v 20 Isak asked Jacob again,"How can you get it as soon as possible, my child?"
\p Jacob replied,"Because of the Lord, the God whom you worship has helped me."
\p
\v 21 Then Isaac said to Jacob,"Come near so that you can ensure that you really are Esau."
\v 22 Jacob approached and Isaac fumbled and said,"Your voice is like Jacob's, but your arms are hairy like Esau's arms."
\v 23 Didn't know that what he actually touched was Jacob because his arms were hairy like Esau's. Before blessing Jacob,
\v 24 Isak asked again,"Are you really Esau?"
\Jacob replied,"Yeah, I'm right Esau."
\p
\v 25 Then Isaac said,"Keep the food close so you can eat it and bless you." Jacob brought the food closer and Isaac ate ​​it. Then Jacob brought wine and Isaac drank the wine too.
\v 26 Then Isak said to him,"My child, draw near and kiss you Father." So Jacob approached and kissed his father.
\p
\v 27 When Isaac smelled the clothes worn by Jacob, he blessed him, saying,
\q1"The smell of my child is like the smell of a field
\q2 who have been blessed by God.
\q1
\v 28 May God give you dew from heaven,
\q2 and make your fields fertile!
\q1 May He give you wheat
\q2 and grapes abound!
\q1
\v 29 May many people serve you,
\q2 and nations bow before you.
\q1 May you rule over your brothers and sisters,
\q2 and let your mother's children bow before you.
\q1 God damn those who curse you
\q2 and bless those who bless you!"
\'s Esau begging him to be blessed
\p
\v 30 Immediately after Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob had just left his father, Esau arrived with the results of his hunt.
\v 31 Esau cooks the meat from his prey and brings it to his father, saying,"Father, sit down and eat the food that I have prepared so you can bless me."
\p
\v 32 Ask Isak"Who are you?"
\Answer Esau,"I am Esau, your firstborn!"
\p
\v 33 Isak was very surprised, and trembling he asked,"Then who has gone hunting and brought food to me before you came? I have eaten everything, and also blessed him with blessings that cannot be taken back."
\p
\v 34 Hearing this, Esau was hurt and cried with a loud voice. Esau begged,"Father, bless me too!"
\p
\v 35 But Isak replied,"Your brother has deceived me and taken your blessing."
\p
\v 36 Esau said,"No wonder its name is Jacob! \f + \fr 27:36 
\Jacob the ft. The name" Jacob"means" holding his heel." But that name can be understood figuratively which means 'cunning person' or 'cheater'. 
\F * He cheated me twice. First, he seized my rights as the firstborn and now again, he seizes my right to get blessings."Then asked Esau to his father," Do you have no other blessings for me?"
\p
\v 37 Isak replied,"I have given him power over you and all your brothers and sisters as servants and all the food and wine belong to him. There is nothing else you can give to you, my child!"
\p
\v 38 Esau asked his father again,"Only that blessing is there for you? Bless me too Father!"Esau wailed in a loud voice.
\p
\v 39 Isak answered by saying,
\q1"You will live in a place where soil is not fertile
\q2 and there will be no dew falling from the sky.
\q1
\v 40 You will live from your sword
\q2 and you will become your brother's servant.
\q1 But if you rebel against it,
\q2 you will be free of power." It's Esau planning to kill Jacob
\p
\v 41 So Esau hated Jacob because his father had given him blessings. In his heart he said,"Soon you will die. Then after the grieving is over, I will kill Jacob!"
\v 42 When knowing Esau's plan, Rebekah called Jacob and said,"Listen, your brother Esau intends to take revenge and will kill you.
\v 43 My child, listen to what your mother says: Save yourself and immediately go to my brother Laban in Haran.
\v 44 Stay there for a while until your sister is no longer angry with you,
\v 45 and he has forgotten what you did to him. Later, the mother will send someone to call and take you home. Mother did not want to lose her two children the same day.
\p
\v 46 Rebekah said to Isak,"I hate life because of Hittite women like these Esau wives. I strongly disagree that later Jacob married one like them. Instead of that happening, I'd better just die!"
