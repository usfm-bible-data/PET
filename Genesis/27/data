\s Isaac blesses Jacob
\p
\v 1 When Isaac was old and could not see anymore, he called Esau, his eldest son, and said, “My child!”
\p Esau answered, “Yes, Father!”
\p
\v 2 Then Isaac said, “I am old, and the day of my death is drawing near.
\v 3 Take your weapon— your bow and the arrow quiver— and go hunting for the animals in the field.
\v 4 Deliciously cook the meat from the game, like I like. Then bring it here for me to eat, so that I can bless you before I die.”
\p
\v 5 When Isaac spoke to Esau, Rebekah heard it. So when Esau had gone hunting,
\v 6 Rebekah said to Jacob, “I heard your father speaking to Esau.
\v 7 Father told your older brother, ‘Go now and hunt, then cook the meat from your game for me. After I eat it, I will give a blessing from the LORD to you before I die.’\f + \fr 27:7 \fk a blessing from the LORD to you …\ft Literally the Hebrew text says, ‘in God's presence’. TSI makes it clear that Rebekah considers this blessing a blessing which is given by the LORD. \f*
\v 8 My child, do now what I tell you.
\v 9 Go and choose the two best goats from the herd. Bring them here so that I can cook the meat as your father likes.
\v 10 Then bring the food to your father to eat, so that your father will bless you before he dies.”
\p
\v 11 Jacob replied, “Mother, my brother Esau's body is hairy, whereas mine is not.
\v 12 What will happen if father feels me?! He would soon know that I am not Esau and also know that I was trying to deceive him. So I would definitely not be blessed by father, but on the contrary, I would be cursed.”
\p
\v 13 Rebekah replied, “If that happens, let me your mother bear the curse of your father. Now listen to my words! Go and get both goats, and quickly bring them here.”
\p
\v 14 Jacob did according to what his mother ordered. He left and returned bringing the young goats. Then his mother immediately prepared a dish that was very delicious, which was liked very much by Isaac.
\v 15 After that Rebekah took Esau's very good clothes which were kept in her house, and gave them to Jacob to wear.
\v 16 She also covered Jacob's arms and neck with young goat skin, and also the part of his neck where there was no body hair.
\v 17 Then she gave the delicious meat dishes and freshly baked bread to him,
\v 18 and Jacob came before his father and said, “Father, it's me.”
\p Isaac asked, “Who are you?— Esau or Jacob.”
\p
\v 19 Jacob answered, “I am Esau, your firstborn child. I've done everything you asked. Sit and enjoy the game I have cooked, so that father can bless me.”
\p
\v 20 Isaac asked Jacob again, “How is it possible that you got it so soon, my child?”
\p Jacob replied, “Because of the LORD, the God whom you worship, has helped me.”
\p
\v 21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so that I (father) can touch you in order to be certain that you really are Esau.”
\v 22 Jacob approached and Isaac felt [him] and said, “Your voice is like Jacob’s voice, but your arms are hairy like Esau's arms.”
\v 23 Isaac didn't know that really what he was touching was Jacob because his arms were hairy like Esau's. Before blessing Jacob,
\v 24 Isaac asked again, “Are you really Esau?”
\p Jacob replied, “Yeah, truly I am Esau.”
\p
\v 25 Then Isaac said, “Bring the food close so I (father) can eat it then bless you.” Jacob brought the food closer and Isaac ate it. Then Jacob brought wine and Isaac drank the wine too.
\v 26 Then Isaac said to him, “My child, draw near and kiss father.”
\v 27 So Jacob approached and kissed his father.
\p When Isaac smelled the clothes worn by Jacob, he blessed him, with saying,
\q1 “The smell of my child is like the smell of the fields
\q2 which have been blessed by the LORD.
\q1
\v 28 May God give you the dew from heaven,
\q2 and make your fields fertile!
\q1 May He give you harvests
\q2 and grapes in abundance!
\q1
\v 29 May many people will serve you,
\q2 and nations bow before you.
\q1 May you rule over your brothers and sisters,
\q2 and let your mother's children bow before you.
\q1 Cursed be those who curse you
\q2 and blessed be those who bless you!”
\s1 Esau asked to be blessed
\p
\v 30 Immediately after Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob had just left his father, Esau arrived with the product of his hunt.
\v 31 Esau cooked the meat from his hunt deliciously and brought it to his father saying, “Father, sit down and eat the food that I have prepared so father can bless me.”
\p
\v 32 Isaac asked, “Who are you?”
\p Esau answered, “I am Esau, your firstborn!”
\p
\v 33 Isak was very surprised and trembling he asked, “Then who has gone hunting and brought food to me before you came? I have eaten all of it, and also blessed him with blessings that cannot be taken back.”
\p
\v 34 Hearing this, Esau was wounded and cried with a loud voice. Esau begged, “Father, bless me too!”
\p
\v 35 But Isaac replied, “Your brother has deceived me and taken your blessing.”
\p
\v 36 Esau said, “No wonder his name is Jacob!\f + \fr 27:36 \fk Jacob \ft The name ‘Jacob’ means ‘holding his heel’. But that name can be understood figuratively to mean ‘cunning person’ or ‘cheater’.\f* He has cheated me twice. First, he seized my rights as the firstborn. And now again, he seized my right to receive the blessing.” Then asked Esau to his father, “Do you have no other blessings for me?”
\p
\v 37 Isaac answered, “I have already given him power over you and all his relatives as his servants, and all the harvests and wine have become his possessions. There is nothing else that father can give to you, my child!”
\p
\v 38 Esau asked his father again, “Is that the only blessing you have? Bless me too, Father!” Then Esau mourned with a loud voice.
\p
\v 39 Isaac answered saying,
\q1 “You will live in a place where soil is not fertile
\q2 and there will be no dew falling from the sky.
\q1
\v 40 You will live from your sword
\q2 and you will become your brother's servant.
\q1 But when you rebel against him,
\q2 you will be freem from his power.”
\s Esau plans to kill Jacob
\p
\v 41 So Esau hated Jacob because his father had given him the blessing. In his heart he said, “Soon father will die. Then after the grieving ceremony is over, I will kill Jacob!”
\v 42 When she found out about Esau's plan, Rebekah called Jacob and said, “Listen, your brother Esau intends to take revenge and kill you.
\v 43 My child, listen to what your mother says: Save yourself and immediately go to my brother Laban in Haran.
\v 44 Stay there for a while until your brother is no longer angry with you
\v 45 and has forgotten what you did to him. Later, mother will send someone to call and bring you home. Mother doesn't want to lose mother's two children on the same day.
\p
\v 46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I hate life because of the Hittite women like Esau’s wives. I will not approve if later Jacob marries someone like them. Instead of that, I would rather die!”
