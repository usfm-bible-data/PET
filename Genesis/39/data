\c 39
\s1 Joseph was brought to Egypt
\p
\v 1 Regarding Joseph, he had been brought to Egypt by those Ishmaelite merchants, and Potiphar— Commander of a Troop of the Egyptian Kings Guard, bought him from them.
\p
\v 2 But the LORD was with Joseph so that as long as he was in his master's house— that is that Egyptian, he always succeeded in all of his work.
\v 3 After Potiphar saw clearly that the LORD was the one who made Joseph succeed in all of his work,
\v 4 then he became happy with Joseph, and he appointed Joseph to become his personal helper— that is to manage his household and all of the wealth that he owned.
\v 5 So after Joseph began to manage everything that Potiphar entrusted to him, the LORD increasingly blessed that Egyptian's family because of Joseph. The LORD blessed all that was owned by him, both in his home and in his field.
\v 6 Potiphar surrendered everything to Joseph to manage all of his possessions. In that way Potiphar only needed to manage his own personal affairs.
\p Joseph's body was stocky and he was very handsome.
\v 7 Time passed, and Potiphar's wife's heart began to be attracted to Joseph then she invited Joseph by saying, “Come, be one body with me.”
\v 8 But Joseph rejected Potiphar's wife's invitation and said, “Master Potiphar has entrusted all of his possessions to me.
\v 9 No one else in this house has authority like me. My master entrusted everything to me except Mother, because Mother is his wife. How could I sin against God by doing such an evil deed?!”
\p
\v 10 Every day the wife of his employer repeatedly invited Joseph to be one body with her, but Joseph kept [for himself] rejecting every invitation.
\v 11 One day, when Joseph was doing his duties and it happened was alone in the house.
\v 12 Potiphar's wife pulled Joseph while saying, “Come, be one body with me!” But Joseph succeeded to run away, however his shirt was left in the hands of Potiphar's wife.
\p
\v 13 When she realized that Joseph had run away and she still held Joseph's shirt in her hand,
\v 14 she screamed and called workers who were outside, “Look, my husband brought this Hebrew person into this house to shame us and he just tried to force me to be one body with him! That's the reason I screamed.
\v 15 As soon as he heard me scream, he ran away and left his shirt.”
\p
\v 16 Potiphar's wife just kept Joseph's shirt to show to her husband.
\v 17 After her husband came home she said to her husband, “The Hebrew servant that you brought into this house has toyed with me.
\v 18 When I screamed, he just ran away and left his shirt.”
\s1 Joseph imprisoned
\p
\v 19 When Potiphar heard his wife complain, “So this is how the servant that you brought into our house treated me,” Potiphar was very angry.
\v 20 Potifar brought Joseph to be imprisoned in the kingdom's prison house.
\v 21 The LORD was with Joseph and kind hearted to him. So the head of the prison was impressed with Joseph.
\v 22 The prison head gave responsibility to Joseph to manage everything that had to do with the other prisoners.
\v 23 The prison head didn't ever ask about what was in Joseph's responsibility. He always succeeded in everything that he did because the LORD was with him.
