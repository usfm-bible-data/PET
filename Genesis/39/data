\c 39
\s1 Joseph was brought to Egypt
\p
\v 1 Regarding Joseph, he had been brought to Egypt by those Ishmaelite merchants, and Potiphar— Commander of a Troop of the Egyptian Kings Guard, bought him from them.
\p
\v 2 But the LORD was with Joseph so that as long as he was in his master's house— that is that Egyptian, he always succeeded in all of his work.
\v 3 After Potiphar saw clearly that the LORD was the one who made Joseph succeed in all of his work,
\v 4 then he became happy with Joseph, and he appointed Joseph to become his personal helper— that is to manage his household and all of the wealth that he owned.
\v 5 So after Joseph began to manage everything that Potiphar entrusted to him, the LORD increasingly blessed that Egyptian's family because of Joseph. The LORD blessed all that was owned by him, both in his home and in his field.
\v 6 Potiphar surrendered everything to Joseph to manage all of his possessions. In that way Potiphar only needed to manage his own personal affairs.
\p Joseph's body was stocky and he was very handsome.
\v 7 Time passed, and Potiphar's wife's heart began to be attracted to Joseph then she invited Joseph by sayin, “Come, be one boddy with me.”
\v 8 But Joseph rejected Potiphar's wife's invitation and said, “Master Potiphar has entrusted all of his possessions to me.
\v 9 No one else in this house has authority like me. My master entrusted everything to me except Mother, because Mother is his wife. How could I sin against God by doing such an evil deed?!”
\p
\v 10 Every day the wife of his employer repeatedly invited Joseph to be one body with her, but Joseph kept [for himself] rejecting every invitation.
\v 11 One day, when Joseph was doing his duties and it happened was alone in the house.
\v 12 Potiphar's wife pulled Joseph while saying, “Come, be one body with me!” But Joseph succeeded to run away, however his clothes were left in the hands of Potiphar's wife.
\p
\v 13 When she realized that Joseph had run away and she still held Joseph's clothes in her hand,
\v 14 she screameddia berteriak dan memanggil pekerja yang berada di luar “Lihatlah, suami saya sudah membawa masuk orang Ibrani ke dalam rumah ini untuk mempermalukan kita dan dia baru saja berusaha memaksaku bersetubuh dengannya! Karena itulah saya berteriak.
\v 15 Ketika dia mendengar saya berteriak, dia melarikan diri dan bajunya tertinggal.”
\p
\v 16 Istri Potifar pun menyimpan baju Yusuf untuk ditunjukkan pada suaminya.
\v 17 Setelah suaminya pulang dia berkata kepada suaminya, “Hamba orang Ibrani yang kau bawa ke rumah ini sudah mempermainkan saya.
\v 18 Ketika saya berteriak, dia pun melarikan diri dan meninggalkan bajunya.”
\s1 Yusuf ditahan
\p
\v 19 Saat Potifar mendengar keluhan istrinya, “Jadi beginilah hamba yang engkau bawa ke dalam rumah kita memperlakukanku,” Potifar sangat marah.
\v 20 Potifar pun membawa Yusuf untuk ditahan di rumah tahanan kerajaan.
\v 21 TUHAN menyertai Yusuf dan berbaik hati kepadanya. Maka kepala penjara terkesan dengan Yusuf.
\v 22 Kepala penjara memberi tanggung jawab kepada Yusuf untuk mengurusi segala sesuatu yang ada kaitannya dengan para tahanan lainnya.
\v 23 Kepala penjara tidak pernah mempertanyakan apa yang berada dalam tanggung jawab Yusuf. Dia selalu berhasil dalam segala sesuatu yang dia lakukan karena TUHAN menyertainya.
