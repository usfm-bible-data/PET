\c 39
\s1 Joseph in Potiphar's house
\p
\v 1 Regarding Joseph, the Ishmaelite merchants had brought him to Egypt and sold him to a commander of the guard troop of the Egyptian king, named Potiphar.
\p
\v 2 But the LORD was with Joseph, so that as long as he was in his master's house— that Egyptian, he always succeeded in all of his work.
\v 3 After Potiphar saw that the LORD made Joseph succeed in all of his work,
\v 4 then he became happy with Joseph, and he appointed Joseph to manage his household and all that he owned like his personal servant.
\v 5 After Joseph worked to manage everything that was entrusted by Potiphar to him, the LORD increasingly blessed that Egyptian's family. The LORD blessed all that was owned by him, both in his home and in his field.
\v 6 Potiphar surrendered everything to Joseph to manage all of his possessions. In that way Potiphar only needed to manage his own personal affairs.
\p Joseph's body was stocky and he was very handsome.
\v 7 Time passed, Potiphar's wife's began to put he heart to Joseph. She said to Joseph, “Come, be one body with me.”
\v 8 But Joseph refused and said, “Master Potiphar has entrusted all of his possessions to me.
\v 9 No one else in this house has authority like me. My master entrusted everything to me except Mother, because Mother is his wife. How could I sin against God by doing such an evil deed?!”
\p
\v 10 Every day the wife of his employer repeatedly invited Joseph to have sex with her, but Joseph kept for himself and rejected every invitation.
\v 11 One day, Joseph was doing his duties and it happened there was no other worker in the house.
\v 12 Potiphar's wife pulled Joseph's shirt and said, “Come, be one body with me!” Joseph succeeded to run away, however his shirt was left in the grip of Potiphar's wife.
\p
\v 13 When she realized that Joseph had run away leaving his shirt,
\v 14 she screamed and called the workers who were outside, “Look, my husband brought this Hebrew person into this house to shame us and he just tried to rape me! That's the reason I screamed.
\v 15 As soon as he heard me scream, he ran away and his shirt was left behind.”
\p
\v 16 Potiphar's wife left Joseph's shirt next to her until her husband returned home.
\v 17 After her husband came home she said to her husband, “The Hebrew slave that you brought into this house has embarrassed me.
\v 18 When I screamed, he just ran away and left his shirt.”
\s1 Joseph imprisoned
\p
\v 19 When Potiphar heard his wife's story, “So this is your slave's behavior towards me,” Potiphar was very angry.
\v 20 Potiphar brought Joseph to [the prison like the king's prisoners/the prison for the king's prisoners].
\v 21 The LORD was with Joseph and faithfully loved him so the head of the prison was impressed with him.
\v 22 He gave responsibility to Joseph to manage everything that had to do with the other prisoners.
\v 23 The prison head didn't ever ask about what was in Joseph's responsibility. Joseph always succeeded in everything that he did because the LORD was with him.
