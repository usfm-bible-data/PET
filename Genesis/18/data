\c 18
\s1 The Lord again promises a son to Abraham and Sarah
\p
\v 1 The Lord appeared another time to Abraham by the oak in Mamre. One day in the dry season and during the bright daytime, Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent.
\v 2 When Abraham looked up/forward, he saw three men standing near his tent. So he ran and welcomed those men, and kneeled before them until his face was on the ground.
\p
\v 3 Then he said to one of them who appeared to be the leader, “Sir, if you do not mind, spend a little while here.
\v 4 Let me bring water to wash your feet, and then rest under (the shade of) this tree.
\v 5 Since you have come here, let me serve you by bringing some food, so that your strength may be restored before you go on your journey.”
\p They replied, “All right, do as you say.”
\p
\v 6 Then Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, take one of the sacks of the best flour, and quickly make bread.”
\v 7 Next he ran to the location of his flock and took the best calf whose meat would be tender. Then he gave it to one of his menservants to immediately process it.
\v 8 After it was cooked, he took two kinds of milk\f + \fr 18:8 \fk two kinds of milk \ft The two kinds of milk which are intended are fresh milk which can be drunk, and a kind of processed milk that is thicker, but not hard like cheese. The second kind probably was like yoghurt, but not sweet like what is sold in modern times.\f* and cooked meat, then he put/served it before his guests. Then he stood near them under the tree as long as they enjoyed that food/meal.
\p
\v 9 So they asked him, “Where is your wife Sarah?”
\p Abraham replied, “She is there in the tent.”
\p
\v 10 Then the man who seemed to be like the leader of the company said, “I will come back next year to meet you in this same month, and at that time Sarah— your wife, will have a baby boy!”
\p Now Sarah was at the door of the tent, behind the man who was speaking, and heard the conversation.
\v 11 Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was no longer had menstruation— as is normal for women who can still become pregnant.
\v 12 So Sarah laughed aloud and said in her heart, “My body has very withered (away) and my husband is very old. How is it possible for me to have a baby?!”
\p
\v 13 Then the one that appeared to be the leader of that group— and evidently He was the LORD— said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say that she is already too old and can’t have a child?’”\f + \fr 18:13 \fk the form of the quote \ft Literally this verse can be translated: The Lord said to Abraham, “ Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘I am already too old, so how could I have a child?!’”\f*
\v 14 I am the LORD. Nothing is impossible for Me! Next year in the same month, I'll be back again, and Sarah will already have a baby!”
\p
\v 15 So Sarah became afraid and denied/disagreed, “I didn't laugh.”
\p But the LORD said, “No need to deny it! Just now you certainly did laugh.”
\s1 Abraham begged for mercy for the people of Sodom
\p
\v 16 So the three men left, and Abraham went with them. When they looked down at the city of Sodom,
\v 17 the LORD said in his heart, “I do not want to conceal from Abraham what I am about to do.
\v 18 I have blessed him so that his descendants (will) become a great and powerful nation. And through him, I will bless all nations.
\v 19 I have chosen him to command his children and his descendants to obey me and to do all that is right and fair. Then I will fulfill all that I have promised him.”
\p
\v 20 Then the Lord said to Abraham, “I have heard lots of complaints about the evil deeds which the people of Sodom and Gomorrah continually do. Their sins have passed the limits.
\v 21 Because of that, now I will go down there to see if the complaints about all their wickedness/crimes are true or not.”
\p
\v 22 Two of their party went off toward the city of Sodom, while Abraham and the LORD still stood facing each other.
\v 23 Abraham approached the Lord and said, “Will you destroy good people together with the wicked?
\v 24 If there were fifty good people in the city, will you destroy all the people of the city? Will you not forgive [it/them] because of those fifty good people?
\v 25 Certainly it would not good for you to destroy the good people with the wicked people, or to treat the good like the wicked. You certainly will not do that, because You are the judge of all the people on earth. And you certainly must judge justly/fairly!”
\p
\v 26 God said, “If I find fifty men in Sodom, I will forgive the whole city because of them.”
\p
\v 27 Then Abraham said, “(Please) forgive that I embolden myself to continue this discussion, LORD. Truly I am only a human being, and I don't have the right to speak directly with You like this.
\v 28 But if there were only forty-five righteous people, and not fifty, would You destroy all the city only for the difference of five men?”
\p The LORD replied, “I will not destroy if I find forty-five righteous people there.”
\p
\v 29 Then Abraham said, “What if there are only forty people?”
\p The LORD replied, “I will not destroy it because of the forty righteous people.”
\p
\v 30 Then Abraham said, “LORD, please do not be angry if I speak again. Then what if only thirty people are good?”
\p The LORD said, “I will not destroy it if I find thirty good people there.”
\p
\v 31 Abraham said again, “Once again I apologize for my continued talking, LORD. If there are only twenty people?”
\p The LORD said, “I will not destroy the city because of the twenty righteous people.”
\p
\v 32 Abraham said, “LORD, please do not be angry when I speak again. What if there were only ten people there?”
\p The LORD said, “I will not destroy it because of the ten good people.”
\p
\v 33 In that way the Lord finished their conversation and departed, and Abraham returned to his house.
