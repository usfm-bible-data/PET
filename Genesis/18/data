\c 18
\s1 The Lord again promised a son to Abraham and Sarah
\p
\v 1 The Lord appeared another time to Abraham by a tree that is considered as sacred owned by Mamre. One day during daytime Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent.
\v 2 When Abraham looked forward, he saw three men standing not far from his tent. So he ran and welcomed those men, and bowed before them until his face was on the ground.
\p
\v 3 Then he said to one of them who appeared to be the leader, “Sir, if you do not mind, spend a little while here.
\v 4 Let me bring water to wash your feet, and then please rest under this tree.
\v 5 Since you have come here, let me (your servant) serve you by bringing some food, so that your energy may be restored before you go on your journey.”
\p They replied, “All right, do as you say.”
\p
\v 6 Then Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, take a sack of the best flour, and quickly make bread!”
\v 7 Then he ran to the location of his flock and took the best calf whose meat would be tender. Then he gave it to one of his male slaves to immediately process it.
\v 8 After that he took two kinds of milk\f + \fr 18:8 \fk two kinds of milk \ft The two kinds of milk which are intended are fresh milk which can be drunk, and a kind of processed milk that is thicker, but not hard like cheese. The second kind probably was like yoghurt, but not sweet like what is sold in modern times.\f* and the cooked meat, then he served it before his guests. While they enjoyed the food, Abraham stood near them under the tree.
\p
\v 9 Then they asked him, “Where is Sarah, your wife?”
\p Abraham replied, “She is there in the tent.”
\p
\v 10 Then the man who seemed to be like the leader of the group said, “I will come back one year from now, and at that time Sarah will already have a baby boy!”
\p Now Sarah was at the door of the tent, behind the man who was speaking, and heard their conversation.
\v 11 Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah no longer had menstruation, as is normal for women who can still become pregnant.
\v 12 So Sarah laughed to herself and said in her heart, “My body is very withered and my husband is very old. How is it possible for me to have a child?!”
\p
\v 13 Then the person that appeared to be the leader of that group— who was in fact the LORD— said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say that she is already too old and can’t have a child?’”\f + \fr 18:13 \fk the form of the quote \ft Literally this verse can be translated: The Lord said to Abraham, “ Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘I am already too old, so how could I have a child?!’”\f*
\v 14 I am the LORD! Nothing is impossible for Me. On year from now I'll be back again, and Sarah will already have a child!”
\p
\v 15 So Sarah became afraid and denied, “I didn't laugh.”
\p But the LORD said, “No need to deny it! Just now you certainly did laugh.”
\s1 Abraham bargained with the LORD
\p
\v 16 So the three men left, and Abraham went with them to send them off. When they looked down at the city of Sodom,
\v 17 the LORD said in his heart, “I do not want to conceal from Abraham what I am going to do,
\v 18 because his descendants will become a great and powerful nation. And through him, I will bless all nations.
\v 19 I have chosen him so that he commands his children and his descendants to obey me and to do all that is right and just. Then I will fulfill all that I have promised him.”
\p
\v 20 Then the LORD said to Abraham, “I have heard complaints about the evil deeds which the people of Sodom and Gomorrah continually do. Their sins have passed the limits.
\v 21 Because of that, now I will go down there to see if the complaints about all their wickedness are true or not.”
\p
\v 22 Two of their (big) group went off toward the city of Sodom, while Abraham and the LORD still stood there facing each other.
\v 23 Abraham approached the LORD and said, “Will You destroy righteous people together with wicked people?
\v 24 If there were fifty righteous people in the city, will you still destroy all the people in the city? Will you not forgive all the people in that city because of those fifty righteous people?
\v 25 Certainly it would not be good for You to destroy the righteous people with the wicked people, or to treat good people like wicked wicked people. You certainly will not do that, because You are the judge of all the people on earth. And You surely judge fairly!”
\p
\v 26 God said, “If I find fifty righteous men in Sodom, I will forgive everyone in that city because of them.”
\p
\v 27 Then Abraham said, “(Please) forgive that I embolden myself to continue this discussion, my Ruler. Truly I am only a human being, and I don't have the right to speak directly with You like this.
\v 28 But, if there were only forty-five righteous people, and not fifty, would You still destroy the whole city only for the difference of five people?”
\p The LORD replied, “I will not destroy if I find forty-five righteous people there.”
\p
\v 29 Then Abraham said, again “What if there are only forty people?”
\p The LORD replied, “I will not destroy it because of the forty righteous people.”
\p
\v 30 Then Abraham said, “My ruler, please do not be angry if I want to speak again. Then what if there are only thirty righteous people?”
\p The LORD said, “I will not destroy if I find thirty righteous people there.”
\p
\v 31 Abraham said again, “Once again I apologize for my continued talking, my Ruler. If there are only twenty people?”
\p The LORD said, “I will not destroy that city because of the twenty righteous people.”
\p
\v 32 Abraham said, “My ruler, please do not be angry when I speak again. What if there were only ten people there?”
\p The LORD said, “I will not destroy it because of the ten righteous people.”
\p
\v 33 In that way the LORD ended their conversation and departed, then Abraham returned to his house.
