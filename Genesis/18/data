\c 18
\s1 The Lord again promises a son to Abraham and Sarah
\p
\v 1 The Lord appeared another time to Abraham by the oak in Mamre. One day in the dry season and during the day when the weather was very hot, Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent.
\v 2 When Abraham looked up/forward, he saw three men standing near his tent. So he ran and welcomed those men, and kneeled before them until his face was on the ground.
\p
\v 3 Then he said to one of them who appeared to be the leader, “Sir, if you do not mind, spend a little while here.
\v 4 Let me bring water to wash your feet, and then rest under (the shade of) this tree.
\v 5 Since you have come here, let me serve you by bringing some food, so that your strength may be restored before you go on your journey.”
\p They replied, “All right, do as you say.”
\p
\v 6 Then Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick, take one of the sacks of the best flour, and quickly make bread.”
\v 7 Next he ran to the location of his flock and took the best calf whose meat would be tender. Then he gave it to one of his menservants to immediately process it.
\v 8 After it was cooked, he took milk, cheese, and cooked meat, then he put/served it before his guests. Then he stood near them under the tree as long as they enjoyed that food/meal.
\p
\v 9 So they asked him, “Where is your wife Sarah?”
\p Abraham replied, “She is there in the tent.”
\p
\v 10 Then the man who seemed to be like the leader of the company said, “I will come back next year to meet you in this same month, and at that time Sarah— your wife, will have a baby boy!”
\p Now Sarah was at the door of the tent, behind the man who was speaking, and heard the conversation.
\v 11 Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was no longer had menstruation— as is normal for women who can still become pregnant.
\v 12 So Sarah laughed aloud and said in her heart, “My body has very withered (away) and my husband is very old. How is it possible for me to have a baby?!”
\p
\v 13 The Lord said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'I am too old, so how can I have a son?'"
\v 14 I am the Lord. Nothing is impossible for me! Next year in the same month, I'll be back again, and Sara already has a baby! "
\p
\v 15 So Sarah became afraid and denied, "I do not laugh."
\p But the Lord said, "Do not deny! You did laugh. "
\s1 Abraham begged the people of Sodom for mercy
\p
\v 16 So the three men left, and Abraham went with them. When they looked down at the city of Sodom,
\v 17 The Lord said to himself, "I do not want Abraham to know what I am about to do.
\v 18 I have blessed him so that his descendants become a great and powerful nation. And through him, I will bless all nations.
\v 19 I have chosen him to send his children and his descendants to obey me and to do all that is right and fair. Then I will fulfill all that I have promised him. "
\p
\v 20 Then the Lord said to Abraham, "I have heard a lot of complaints about the evil deeds that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah have done. Their sins have passed the limits.
\v 21 So now I'm going down there to see if the complaints about their crimes are true or false. "
\p
\v 22 The two men went to the city of Sodom, while Abraham and the Lord stood on the other side.
\v 23 Abraham approached the Lord and said, "Will you destroy the good man and the wicked?
\v 24 If there were fifty men in the city, would you destroy all the city? Do not you forgive him for fifty good people?
\v 25 It is not good for you to destroy the good man with the wicked, or to treat the righteous with the wicked. You certainly will not do it, because You are the judge of all the people on earth. And you must judge fairly! "
\p
\v 26 God said, "If I find fifty men in Sodom, I will forgive the whole city for them."
\p
\v 27 Then Abraham said, "I'm sorry I'm brave enough to continue this talk, Lord. I am only a human being, and it is not right to speak directly to the Lord like this.
\v 28 But if there were only forty-five righteous men, and not fifty, would you destroy all the city only for the sake of five men? "
\p The Lord replied, "I will not destroy if I have forty-five righteous men there."
\p
\v 29 Then Abraham said, "What if there are only forty people?"
\p The Lord replied, "I will not destroy it because of the forty righteous ones."
\p
\v 30 Then Abraham said, "Lord, do not be angry when I speak. Then what if only thirty people are good? "
\p The Lord said, "I will not destroy if I find thirty good men there."
\p
\v 31 Abraham said again, "I apologize again when I speak, Lord. Had there been only twenty people? "
\p The Lord said, "I will not destroy the city because of the twenty righteous ones."
\p
\v 32 Abraham said, "Lord, please do not be angry when I speak again. What if there were only ten people there? "
\p The Lord said, "I will not destroy it because of ten good people."
\p
\v 33 When they had finished speaking, the Lord departed, and Abraham returned to his house.
