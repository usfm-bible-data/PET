\c 23
\s1 Sarah passed away and was buried
\p
\v 1-2 Sara passed away at the age of 127 in the town of Kiryat Arba— now called Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham mourned and wept over of the death of his wife.
\p
\v 3 After that Abraham left his wife’s corpse and went to meet the Hittites, the original residents of the land, and said to them,
\v 4 “I am only an immigrant/sojourner who lives among you. Allow me to buy a piece of land from you to bury my wife's corpse.”
\p
\v 5 So they said to him,
\v 6 “Sir, we have regarded you as a great ruler among us. Please choose the best of our burial places, and bury your wife there. We're all ready to give you wherever you want for free.”
\p
\v 7 So Abraham bowed his head before them
\v 8 and said, “If so, then please speak to Ephron— the son of Zohar,
\v 9 so that he will sell the cave at Machpelah which he owns, which is on the edge of his field. I am willing to pay according to its selling price, so that that the field and the cave will become my possession. And may you be the witnesses of the purchase.”
\p
\v 10 It happened that Ephron was sitting among the Hittites who were present at meeting near the city gate. Then in front of all the people who were there he answered,
\v 11 “No need, Sir! Let my brothers of myw own race— that is, all the Hittite people who are here, be the witnesses between us both that the field and the cave of Machpelah in it, I give it to you for free! Please bury your wife there.”
\p
\v 12 So Abraham again bowed his head before the Hittites,
\v 13 then with the intention to be heard by all the people who were there he said to Ephron, “Please listen to me! I want to buy the field from you according to its selling price. Please accept this offer so my wife can be burried there.”
\p
\v 14 Ephron told Abraham,
\v 15 “Listen, Sir! The price of the land is just 400 shekels of silver.\f + \fr 23:15 \fk 400 shekels \ft At that time 400 shekels were equivalent to around 4.6 kilograms.\f* There's no need for us to work ourselves up over such a small amount of money as that. Take the field and bury your wife there.”\f + \fr 23:15 \fk Ephron's words \ft Ephron is still pretending that he still is giving that land for free. However really he intends to sell the land for a high price.\f*
\p
\v 16 Abraham agreed with the price that Ephron had mentioned. Then he counted 400 pieces of silver to give to Ephron in front of all those who were there, according to the value of silver that was used at that time.
\p
\v 17 That's how the field of Ephron which is in Machpelah— on the east of Hebron,\f + \fr 23:17 \fk Hebron \ft Literally, ‘Mamre’. In this verse, TSI uses ' Hebron ' as it is used more frequently in the OT. \f* become Abraham’s possession, including the cave in it and the trees that are in the field.
\v 18 And all the Hittites who were present at the meeting at the city gate acknowledged that the land had become the possession of Abraham.
\v 19 After that Abraham buried his wife in that cave of Machpelah. That place is part of the Canaanite region.
\p
\v 20 In that way Ephron's field and cave become Abraham’s for burial.
