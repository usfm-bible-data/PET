\c 23
\s1 Sara died and was buried
\p
\v 1-2 Sara died at the age of 127 in the town of Kiryat Arba— now called Hebron, in the land of Canaan. And Abraham wept and mourned because of the death of his wife.
\p
\v 3 After that Abraham left the body of his wife and went to meet with the Hittites who lived in that land and said to them,
\v 4 “I am an immigrant who lives in the midst of you. Therefore allow me to buy a piece of land from one of you, so that I may bury my wife's corpse.”
\p
\v 5 So they said to him,
\v 6 “Sir, we (always) have regarded you as a great ruler among us. Please Sir you choose the best of our burial places, and bury your wife there. We're all ready to give you the place wherever you Sir want.”
\p
\v 7 So Abraham bowed down before them
\v 8 and he said, “If so, then please speak to Ephron— the son of Zohar,
\v 9 so that he will sell the cave at Makkedah which he owns, which is on the edge of his field. I am willing to pay according to its selling price, so that that land will become my possession. And let you be the witnesses of the purchase.”
\p
\v 10 It happened that Ephron was sitting among the Hittites who were present at the entrance of the city gate. Then in front of all the people who were there he answered,
\v 11 “No need, Sir! Let my brother's of the Hittite race who are here, be the witnesses between us both that the field with the cave of Machpelah in it, I give it to you for free! Please bury your wife there.”
\p
\v 12 So Abraham again bowed down before the Hittites,
\v 13 and in the hearing of all the people who were with there he said to Ephron, “Please listen to me! I want to buy the field from you according to its selling price. Accept my offer so I can bury my wife there.”
\p
\v 14 Efron told Abraham,
\v 15 “Listen, Sir! The price of the land is just 400 pieces of silver. There's no need for us to bargain about such small amount of money as that. Take the land and bury your wife there.”
\p
\v 16 Abraham agreed with the price that Ephron had mentioned. Then he counted 400 pieces of silver to give to Ephron in front of all those who were there, according to the value of silver that was used at that time.
\p
\v 17 That's how the field of Efron which is in Machpelah— on the east of Hebron,\f + \fr 23:17 \fk Hebron \ft Literally, ‘Mamre’. Mamre is only a little to the north of Hebron, which often is mentioned in the OT.\f* belongs to Abraham, including the cave and the trees that are in the field.
\v 18 And all the Hittites who were present at the meeting at the city gate admitted that the land had become the possession of Abraham.
\v 19 After that Abraham buried his wife in that cave of Machpelah. That place is part of the Canaanite region.
\p
\v 20 In that way Ephron's field in Makpelah, on the east of Mamre— including the cave and the trees that are in that field, became the possession of Abraham.
