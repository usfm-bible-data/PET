\c Esau's descendants
\p
\v 1 The following are Esau's descendants— who is also called Edom.
\v 2-3 Esau married three women who came from Canaan.
\li The first wife was named Adah (the child of a Hittite named Elon).
\li The second wife was named Oholibama (child of Anah, and granddaughter of a Hivite named Zibeon).
\li And the third wife was named Basemath (child of Ishmael). Basemath had an older brother named Nebaioth.\f + \fr 36:2-3 \fk Esau's wives names \ft The names of Esau's wives here are different than those found in Gen. 26:34 and 28:8. There are interpreters that think that Esau gave new names to his three wives. If that interpretation is correct, than Adah was given the name Basemath (before Esau married Basemath the child of Ishmael). It's also possible that Oholibama was given the name Judith. But because there is a difference in the name of the parents of Oholibama and Judith, Judith may have died or been divorced before having descendants. Clearly the descendants of Oholibama were given lowest status in this list of descendants. Then according to Gen. 28:8, Basmath Ishmael's child was given the name Mahalath.\f*

\v 4-5 Esau's three wives birthed five sons for him in Canaan. Adah birthed a child named Eliphaz. Basmath birthed a child named Reuel. And Oholibama birthed three children— that is Jeush, Jalam and Korah.
\p
\v 6-8 Esau and Jacob owned much wealth and flocks. And because of their flocks that were so many, then the land where they lived became very crowded and not enough to meet the needs of their flocks. For that reason, Esau (who was also called Edom) went and left Jacob taking his three wives, all of his children and all of the people who were with him, all of his flocks or livestock, and all of his possessions that he had gotten as long as he was in Canaan. They moved to a land that was far— that is the mountainous area of Seir.
