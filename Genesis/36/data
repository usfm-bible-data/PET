\p
\v 1 The following are Esau's descendants, who is also called Edom.
\v 2-3 Esau married three women who came from Canaan.
\li The first wife was named Adah (the child of a Hittite named Elon).
\li The second wife was named Oholibama (child of Anah, and granddaughter of a Hivite named Zibeon).
\li And the third wife was named Basemath (child of Ishmael). Basemath had an older brother named Nebaioth.\f + \fr 36:2-3 \fk Esau's wives names \ft The names of Esau's wives and their tribal origin in this verse differ from what is written in Gen. 26:34 and 28:9. There are those who interpret that Esau gave new names to his three wives. Based on that interpretation, the first wife, Adah, was given the name Basemath, the second wife, Oholibama, was given the name Judith, and the third wife, Basmath, was given the name Mahalath.\f*

\v 4-5 Esau's three wives birthed five sons for him in Canaan. Adah birthed a child named Eliphaz. Basmath birthed a child named Reuel. And Oholibama birthed three children named Jeush, Jalam and Korah.
\p
\v 6-8 Esau and Jacob owned much wealth and flocks. And because their flocks were too many, then the land where they lived was not enough to meet the needs of their flocks. For that reason, Esau (who was also called Edom) went and left Jacob taking his three wives, all of his children and all of the people who lived with him, all of his flocks, and all of his possessions that he had gotten as long as he was in Canaan. They moved to a land that was far, in the mountainous area of Seir.
