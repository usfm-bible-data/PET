\c 3
\s1 The first people sinned because they didn't obey God
\p
\v 1 The snake was the most tricky animal among all wild animals that the LORD God created. The snake came to the woman and asked, “Is it true that God said to you that you cannot eat the fruits from the trees that are found in this garden?”
\p
\v 2-3 The woman answered, “Not so. The Lord forbid us touch— moreover eat fruit that is in the middle of the garden. If we transgress, then we will die. But we are allowed to eat all the other fruit.”
\p
\v 4 The snake said to the woman, “No! You won't die!
\v 5 God said that because knows if you eat fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden, your eyes and thinking will be open and you will become just like Him— that is, you will know between things that are good and that are evil.”
\p
\v 6 The woman saw that the tree produced fruit that was very beautiful to look at and delicios to eat. Also she wanted to become wise. Because of that she picked several of the fruit and ate (it/them). Then she also gave the fruit to her husband\f + \fr 3:6 \fk husband \ft There is a word in the Hebrew language often is often translated like the TB as 'who was with her', in the sentence ‘was given by her also to her husband who was with her’. The interpretational problem is that it is difficult to determine if the meaning of that word was: 1) Adam was with Eve when the forbidden fruit was given to him, or, 2) Adam was with Eve and witnessed the conversation of Eve with the snake.\f* to be eaten. As soon as they ate that fruit
\v 7 their eyes and thinking were suddenly opened. They were ashamed because they were suddenly aware that they were naked. Then they put together several fig tree leaves to cover their bodies.
\p
\v 8 Coming up on the afternoon, when the gentle breeze began to blow, they heard the LORD's footsteps that were walking in the garden. Then they hid behind trees that were in the garden, so that the LORD wouldn't see them.
\v 9 But the LORD called the man and said, “Where are you?”\f + \fr 3:9 \fk Where are you? \ft The LORD asked this not because He didn't know where Adam was. The reason for this question is so that Adam would want to talk with the LORD.\f*
\p
\v 10 The man answered, "I heard the sound of Your footsteps walking in the garden. And because I am naked, I was afraid, so I hid."
\p
\v 11 The LORD said, "How did you know that you were naked? Did you already eat fruit from the tree that I forbid?"
\p
\v 12 The man answered, “Ya, but that was because of the woman You gave to me who gave me the fruit, so that I ate it.”
\p
\v 13 Then the LORD asked the woman, “Why did you do that?”
\p The woman answered, “That snake deceived me, so that I ate that fruit!”
\b
\p
\v 14 So the LORD said to the snake,
\q1 “Because you did that,
\q1 then of all animal lifestock and wild animals,
\q2 only you and your offspring that I will punish.
\q1 Beginning now, you and all your descendants
\q2 will move by slithering using the stomach,
\q2 and you will have to lick the dust for as long as you live.
\q1
\v 15 And I will make you and this woman mutual enemies.
\q2 And your descendants together with the descendants of this woman will always be enemies.
\q1 You will bite the heel of her male descendant,
\q2 but he will destroy your head.”\f + \fr 3:15 \fk difficulty of plural and singular \ft In the Hebrew language, the word translated as ‘descendants’ has the base meaning of ‘seed (singular)'. But although ‘seed’ spoken of as singular, it also appears to be a collective word. This means, what is spoken of as ‘seed’ is frequently understood as plural. (Sand is also frequently spoken of as a collective.) It is likely that Eve assumed that her first son would crush the head of the snake. But when that didn't happen, the Jewish people interpreted that Eve's ‘seed/descendants’ were plural and including the whole nation of Israel. Although these two verses speak of a male descendant as ‘he’, that can still be understood as to represent the whole nation of Israel. But in the end we see that the ‘seed/descendant’ which crushes the head of the snake is singular— that is Jesus. Compare with Gal. 3:16.\f*
\b
\p
\v 16 And the LORD said to the woman,
\q1 “I will add suffering to you and to every woman at the time of birth.
\q1 You will desire to rule over your husband,
\q2 but he is the one who will rule over you.”\f + \fr 3:16 \fk alternative meaning \ft The last two lines can also be translated, “Regardless you will continue to desire intimate relations with your hurband. And he will rule over you.” The translation in the text of the TSI fits better in the context of a judgment against Eve.”\f*
\b
\p
\v 17 The God said to the man,
\q1 “I commanded you to not eat fruit from that tree.
\q2 But you broke it (the commandment) by following the words of your wife.
\q1 So because of that deed of yours, I curse the ground.
\q2 As long as you live you will be forced to work with hard labor in order to produce food from the ground.
\q1
\v 18 The ground will tend to produce thistles and thorny plants,
\q2 and you will be forced to eat wild plants from the forest.
\q1
\v 19 So your life long,
\q1 before you die and return to become dirt,
\q2 you have to bathe in sweat
\q2 to produce your food from the ground of your garden.
\q1 I created you from dirt,
\q2 so your body will decay and return to become dirt again.”
\b
\p
\v 20 The man was named Adam. \f + \fk Adam \fr 3:20 \ft The name Adam means ‘(a) human/person’. \f* He gave the name Eve to his wife— which means 'giver of life'— because all the family of mankind are her descendants.
\v 21 Then the LORD made clothing from animal skin and put the clothes on them.
\p
\v 22 Then the LORD said, “Now they have joined in being like Us\f + \fr 3:22 \fk joined in being like Us \ft The Hebrew here can be translated, ‘became like one of Us’. With this form of phrase, the word ‘one’ in Hebrew means ‘included in/joined possessing the same characteristic’ as Us. In the context of this verse, that means being able to distinguish good from evil. The word ‘one’ in this verse does not give the meaning that mankind has become like ‘just one’ of the Trinity who are mentioned as ‘Us’ in this verse. (The meaning is not that Adam has become like the Son.) Observe the way the word ‘one’ is translated in these verses: Hak. 17:11; 1Sam. 17:36; 2Sam. 9:1; Ob. 11; dan 2Chron. 18:12. See also the footnote at Gen. 1:26\f* in being able to distinguish what is good from what is evil. So it must not happen that they pick and eat fruit from the tree of life. I do not permit them to live forever.”
\v 23 Because of that, the LORD expelled Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden to work the ground, from which Adam had been formed.
\v 24 After that the LORD placed several guarding angels \f + \fr 3:24 \fk guarding angels \ft In Hebrew ‘guarding angels’ are called ‘cherubim’.\f* at the gate of entrance to the Garden of Eden— which was to the east of that garden. The LORD also placed a miraculous sword that was flaming and turned on its own turned around and around the tree of life. In that way no one could take eat fruit from the tree of life.
