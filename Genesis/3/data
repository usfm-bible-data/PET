\c 3
\s1 The first man sins because he didn't obey God
\p
\v 1 The snake was the most tricky animal among all wild animals that the LORD created. The snake asked the woman, "Is it true there's a fruit that God forbid you to eat from all the trees that are found in this garden?"
\p
\v 2-3 The woman answered, "The Lord forbid us touch— moreover eat fruit that is in the middle of the garden. If we transgress, then we will die. But we are allowed to eat all the other fruit."
\p
\v 4 The snake said to the woman, "Certainly you won't die.
\v 5 God said that because knows if you eat fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden, your eyes and thinking will be open and you will become just like Him— that is, you will know between things that are good and that are evil."
\p
\v 6 The woman saw that the tree produced fruit that was very beautiful and. She wanted it because wanted to become wise. Then several of the fruit of that tree were picked and eaten by her. Then she also gave the fruit mentioned to her husband \f+ \fr 3:6 \fk husband \ft The word 'immah' in the Hebrew language often is translated (husband) 'the one who was with her' (Eve). A translation problem, it can't be determined if the meaning of that word was Adam was with Eve when the forbidden fruit was given to him, or Adam was with Eve and heard Eve talking with the snake.\f* to be eaten. As soon as ate the fruit
\v 7 their eyes and thinking were suddenly opened. They were ashamed because they were just aware that they were naked. Then they put together several fig tree leaves to cover their bodies.
\p
\v 8 Coming up on the afternoon, when the gentle breeze began to blow, they heard the LORD's footsteps that were walking in the garden. Then they hid behind trees that were in the garden, so that the LORD wouldn't be able to see them.
\v 9 But the LORD called the man and said, "Why are you trying to hide from Me?"
\p
\v 10 The man answered, "I heard the sound of Your footsteps walking in the garden, and because naked, I hid because afraid."
\p
\p
\p
\v 11 The LORD said, "How did you know that you were naked? Did you already eat fruit from the tree that I forbid?"
\p
\v 12 The man answered, "It wasn't me who transgressed! My female companion is the one that gave it to me, then I ate."
\p
\v 13 Then the LORD asked the woman, "Why did you do like that?"
\p The woman answered, "That snake deceived me, so that I (shouldn't be Aku but aku) ate that fruit!"
\p
\v 14 The LORD said to that snake, "Because you did that thing, then of all animal lifestock and wild animals, only you and your offspring that I will punish. Beginning now, you and all kinds of snakes will move by using the stomach and forced to like dust.
\v 15 And I will make you along with your offspring and this woman along with her offspring mutual enemies. Later, will be born a male person from the woman's offspring. You will attack his heal, but he will destroy your head."
\p
\v 16 the LORD said to the woman, "I will add suffering to you and to every woman at the time of birth. You will long for closeness with your husband, however he will control you."
\p
\v 17 The God said to the man, "Because you transgressed My command by following the words of your wife to eat the fruit that I forbid, then now the ground is cursed because of you. So you have to work very hard to obtain food produce from the ground.
\v 18 The ground will produced thistles and thorny plants, and you will be forced to eat wild plants from the forest.
\v 19 Before you die and return to become dirt, you have to bathe in sweat to produce your food. Because I created you from dirt, so your body will decay and return to become dirt.
\p
\v 20 The man was named Adam. \f + \fk Adam \fr 3:20 \ft The name Adam means '[person] man'. \f* He gave the name Eve to his wife— which means 'give life', because all the family of mankind are her offspring.
\v 21 Then the LORD made clothing from animal skin and put the clothes on them.
\p
\v 22 Then the LORD said, "Now they have become like Us because they can distinguish from what is good and evil. So they can't pick and eat fruit from the tree of life."
\v 23 Because of that, the LORD chased Adam—who was made of dirt, out of the garden of Eden to work the ground in another place.
\v 24 After the LORD expelled them to the part east of the garden, He placed several guarding angels \f + \fk guarding angels \fr3:24 \ft Literally, 'cherubim'. Cherubim are heavenly creatures with wings, a symbol of the greatness of God and His presence\f* around the tree of life. And God also placed an awesome flaming sword that turned by itself around that tree. In that way no one could return to eat fruit from the tree of life.
