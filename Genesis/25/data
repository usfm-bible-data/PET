\c 25
\s1 The descendants of Abraham with his wife Keturah
\p
\v 1 Abraham took another wife named Keturah.
\v 2 Keturah gave birth to six sons named Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Isbak and Suah.
\v 3 And Jokshan had two sons named Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan became the Assyrian nation, the Letus nation, and the Leumite nation.
\v 4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these are descendants of Keturah.
\p
\v 5 Abraham bequeathed (lit. made to inherit) all of his possessions to Isaac.
\v 6 But to his other children— namely the children of the female slaves that he made as wives— he also gave valuable gifts.\f + \fr 25:6 \fk valuable gifts \ft It is certain that the reason for giving these gifts was to help them begin a new life in a new place. So it is likely that the gifts included cattle, slaves, jewelry, precious metals, etc.\f* After that he ordered them to leave Isaac and go to the east.
\s1 Abraham died and was buried
\p
\v 7-8 Abraham died after enjoying a long life of 175 years. At that time the LORD placed him together with his ancestors who had already died (Indonesian idiom: left the world).\f + \fr 25: 7-8 \fk The Lord gathered him … \ft Literally, ‘he was gathered to his ancestors’. Certainly the Person who ‘gathered’ (him) is God. See the footnote in Gen. 37:35 about Sheol.\f*
\v 9-10 Isaac and Ishmael buried their father in the cave of Machpelah on the east side of Hebron,\f + \fr 25:9 \fk Hebron \ft Literally ‘Mamre’. See the footnote at Kej. 23:17\f* in the field that before was bought by Abraham from Ephron, the son of a Hittite named Zohar. Abraham was buried beside the grave of Sarah.
\v 11 Then God blessed Isaac as (He) had blessed his father. Isaac settled near the well of Beer Lahai-Roi.\f + \fr 25:11 \ft The meaning of the name of that well is explained in Gen. 16:14— namely ‘well of the LORD who lives, who watches me’.\f*
\s1 The sons of Ishmael
\p
\v 12 This is the list of the offspring of Ishmael, son of Abraham through Hagar— Sarah's slave, the Egyptian.
\v 13 Ishmael had twelve sons. Their names are Nebayoth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
\v 14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
\v 15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
\v 16 Those are the names of the twelve sons of Ishmael. Each of them became a tribal leader. And every city that became the center of the tribes that were led (by them), was named according to their respective names.
\v 17 Ishmael lived for 137 years, then died. That is the time when the LORD gathered him together with his ancestors in the world of the dead.
\v 18 The descendants of Ishmael lived to the east of the descendants of Issac, that is in the region of Havilah as far as Shur, in the direction of Assyria, to the east of Egypt. These twelve tribes lived far from the descendants of Isaac.\f + \fr 25:18 \fk lived far from … \ft The last sentence of this verse can also be understood, “These twelve tribes always were hostile with the descendants of Isaac.”Compare with Gen. 16:12.\f*
\s1 The birth of Esau and Jacob
\p
\v 19 This is the account of the family of Issac son of Abraham:
\v 20 When Isaac was 40 years old, he married Rebekah— the daughter of Bethuel, the younger sister of Laban, who was from Padan Aram.\f + \fr 25:20 \fk Padan Aram \ft Padam Aram is located in the northern region of Mesopotamia, in the part that is now in the northern part of Syria or southern Turkey.\f*
\v 21 But Rebekah was barren. So Isak prayed to the LORD and the LORD answered his prayer, so that his wife became pregnant.
\v 22 It became evident that Rebekah was pregnant with twins. But his two children were in conflict with each other in her womb. Then Rebekah prayed asking guidance/pointers from the LORD, “LORD, why is this happening to me?”
\p
\v 23 Then the LORD said to her,
\q1 “Two sons are in your womb,
\q1 their descendants will be the ancestors of two great nations
\q2 which will be enemies of each other.
\q1 The young will be stronger.
\q2 The older will be his servant.”
\p
\v 24 When the time came, Rebekah gave birth to the two twins.
\v 25 The first child was red, and his whole body was covered with (body) hair. So they called him Esau.\f + \fr 25:25 \fk Esau \ft In Hebrew the sound of the pronunciation of the name ‘Esau’is almost the same as the word which means ‘much (body) hair’. Another name for Esau is Edom, which means ‘red’.\f*
\v 26 And when the second child was born, his hand was holding his brother's heel. So they named him Jacob.\f + \fr 25:26 \fk Jacob \ft The name ‘Jacob’ means ‘holding the heel’. But the name can be understood as a figure of speech meaning ‘cunning person’ or ‘trickster’.\f* At the time of their birth, Isaac was 60 years old.
\s1 Esau sells his birthright
\p
\v 27 When they became adults, Esau became a person talented in hunting and he liked to live in the fields. While Jacob became a quiet man and liked to stay in the camp.
\v 28 So Isaac loved Esau more because he liked to eat the meat from Esau's hunting, while Rebekah loved Jacob more.
\p
\v 29 One day when Jacob was cooking red bean soup, Esau returned from hunting in the fields very hungry.
\v 30 So Esau said to Jacob, “I am very hungry! Give me some of the red bean soup.” (That is why Esau was given the nickname ‘Edom’, meaning ‘red’).
\p
\v 31 Jacob replied to Esau, “Alright, but you must exchange it for your firstborn right.”
\p
\v 32 Esau said, “I'm about to die! What's the use of firstborn right to me?!”
\p
\v 33 Jacob said, “Swear first that you will exchange your firstborn right to me.” Then Esau swore to exchange the firstborn right to Jacob.
\v 34 Then Jacob gave bread and that red bean soup to Esau. Esau ate and drank, then left. In such a way Esau didn't value his firstborn right.
