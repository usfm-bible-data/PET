\s1 The descendants of Abraham with Keturah
\p
\v 1 Abraham took another wife named Keturah.
\v 2 Keturah gave birth to six sons named Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Isbak and Suah.
\v 3 And Jokshan had two sons— namely Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan became the Assyrian nation, the Letus nation, and the Leumite nation.
\v 4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Efer, Enoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these are descendants of Ketura.
\p
\v 5 Abraham bequeathed (lit. made to inherit) all of his possessions to Isaac.
\v 6 But to his sons— namely the sons of his concubines, he also gave valuable gifts. However, after giving him gifts, he ordered them to leave Isak and go to the east.
\s1 Abraham died and was buried
\p
\v 7-8 Abraham died at a very old age— namely 175 years. At that time the Lord united him with his ancestors in the land of the dead.\f + \fr 25: 7-8 \fk The Lord united him ... \ft Literally, “he was gathered to his ancestors.” Certainly the Person who ‘gathered’ him is God. This means that Abraham was placed by God along with his ancestors in the world of the dead (Syeol). But in the age this book was writen, the LORD had not given information about the lives of the ancestors as Jesus taught in Matt. 22:32, Mrk. 12:27, and Luk. 20: 38.\f*
\v 9-10 Isaac and Ishmael buried their father in the cave of Machpelah on the east side of Hebron,\f + \fr 25:9 \fk Hebron \ft Literally ‘Mamre’. See the footnote at Kej. 23:17\f*— the field that Abraham had bought from Ephron the son of Zohar (the Hittite). Abraham was buried beside his wife Sarah.
\v 11 Then God blessed Isaac as he had blessed his father. Isak settled near the well of Lahai-Roi.\f + \fr 25:11 \ft The meaning of the name of that well is explained in Gen. 16:14— namely ‘well of the LORD who lives, who watches me’.\f*
\s1 The sons of Ishmael
\p
\v 12 Here is the list of the sons of Ishmael, son of Abraham through Hagar:
\v 13 Ishmael had twelve sons. Their names are Nebayoth, Kedar, Adbe'el, Mibsam,
\v 14 Misma, Duma, Masa,
\v 15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedar.
\v 16 These are the names of the twelve sons of Ishmael. Each of them became a tribal leader. And every city that became the center of the tribes that were led (by them), was named according to their respective names.
\v 17 Ishmael lived for 137 years, then died.
\v 18 The descendants of Ishmael lived to the east of the descendants of Issac— that is in the region of Havilah as far as Shur, in the direction of Assyria, to the east of Egypt. These twelve tribes were always enemies/hostile to the descendants of Isaac.
\s1 The birth of Esau and Jacob
\p
\v 19 This is the account of the family of Issac son of Abraham:
\v 20 When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah— the daughter of Bethuel, the younger sister of Laban, who was from Padan Aram.
\v 21 But Rebekah was barren. So Isak prayed to the Lord and the Lord answered his prayer, so that his wife became pregnant.
\v 22 It became evident that she was pregnant with twins. But his two children were in conflict with each other in her womb. Then Rebekah prayed asking guidance/pointers from the Lord, saying, “LORD, why is this happening to me?”
\p
\v 23 And the LORD said to her,
\q1 “Two sons are in your womb,
\q1 their descendants will be the ancestors of two great nations
\q2 which will be enemies of each other.
\q1 The young will be stronger.
\q2 The older will be his servant.”
\p
\v 24 When the time came, Rebekah's two children were born— twins.
\v 25 The first was red, and his whole body was covered with (body) hair. So they called him Esau.\f + \fr 25:25 \fk Esau \ft The name Esau is almost the same as the Hebrew word meaning ‘much (body) hair’. Another name for Esau is Edom, which means ‘red’.\f*
\v 26 And when the second child was born, his hand was holding his brother's heel. So they called him Jacob.\f + \fr 25:26 \fk Jacob \ft The name ‘Jacob’ means ‘holding the heel’. But the name can be understood as a figure (of speech) meaning ‘cunning person’ or ‘trickster’.\f* At the time of their birth, Isak was 60 years old.
\s1 Esau sells his birthright
\p
\v 27 When they had grown old, Esau became a person tallented in hunting and he liked to live in the fields. While Jacob became a quiet man and liked to stay in the camp.
\v 28 So Isaac loved Esau more because he liked to eat the meat from Esau's hunting, while Rebekah loved Jacob more.
\p
\v 29 One day when Jacob was cooking vegetable soup, Esau returned from hunting the fields hungry and tired.
\v 30 So Esau said to Jacob, “I am hungry! Give me some of the red soup.” (That is why Esau was given the nickname ‘Edom’, meaning ‘red’).
\p
\v 31 Jacob said to Esau, “Good, but you must exchange it for your birthright.”
\p
\v 32 Esau said, “I'm about to die! What's the use of a birthright to me?!”
\p
\v 33 Jacob said, “Swear first that you will give me your birthright.” Then Esau swore to give the firstborn right to Jacob.
\v 34 Then Jacob gave bread and that vegetable soup to Esau. Esau ate and drank, then left. In such a way Esau didn't value his firstborn right.
