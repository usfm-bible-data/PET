\s1 The descendants of Abraham with Keturah
\p
\v 1 Abraham took another wife named Keturah.
\v 2 Keturah gave birth to six sons named Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Isbak and Suah.
\v 3 And Jokshan had two sons— namely Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan became the Assyrian nation, the Letus nation, and the Leumite nation.
\v 4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Efer, Enoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these are descendants of Ketura.
\p
\v 5 Abraham gave his inheritance to Isaac.
\v 6 But to his sons— namely the sons of his concubines, he also gave gifts. However, after giving him gifts, he ordered them to leave Isak and go to the east.
\s1 Abraham died and was buried
\p
\v 7-8 Abraham died at his old age - 175 years. At that moment the Lord unites him with his ancestors in the grave.
\F + \fr 25: 7-8 \fk The Lord unites him ...
\ft. Literally, "he was gathered to his ancestors." the person who 'collects' is God. At the time of the writers (Moses) and Abraham, this meant Abraham was placed by God along with his ancestors in the world of the dead (Syeol). But in those days the Lord had not told about the lives of the ancestors as Jesus taught in Matt. 22:32, Mrk. 12:27, and Luk. 20: 38. \f *
\v 9-10 Isaac and Ishmael buried their father in the cave of Machpelah on the east side of Hebron, the field that Abraham had bought from Ephron the son of Zohar (the Hittite). Abraham was buried beside his wife's grave.
\v 11 Then God blessed Isaac as he blessed his father. Isak settled near the well of Lahai-Roi.
\X + \xo 25:11 \xt See what Lahai-Roi means in Gen. 16: 14 \x *
\s1 The sons of Ishmael
\p
\v 12 Here is the list of the sons of Ishmael son of Abraham through Hagar.
\v 13 Ishmael had twelve sons. Their names are: Nebayoth, Kedar, Adbe'el, Mibsam,
\v 14 Misma, Duma, Masa,
\v 15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedar.
\v 16 These are the names of the twelve sons of Ishmael. Each of them became a tribal leader. And every city that became the center of the tribes led, was named according to their respective names.
\v 17 Ishmael had died 137 years ago.
\v 18 The sons of Ishmael lived in the east side of the tribe of Issachah in the territory of Havilah as far as Shur, as far as Asur east of Egypt. The twelve tribes were always hostile to the descendants of Isaac.
\s1 The birth of Esau and Jacob
\p
\v 19 This is the account of the family of Issach son of Abraham.
\v 20 When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the sister of Laban, who was from Padan Aram.
\v 21 But Rebekah was barren. So Isak prayed to the Lord and the Lord answered his prayer, so that his wife was pregnant.
\v 22 She was pregnant with twins. But his two children were in conflict with each other. Then Rebekah prayed to the Lord, saying, "Lord, why did this happen to me?"
\p
\v 23 And the Lord said to him,
\q1 "Two children are in your womb, Their descendants will be the ancestors of two great nations
\q2 are hostile to each other.
\q1 The young will be stronger The old q2 will be his servant. "
\p
\v 24 When the time came, Rebekah's two sons were born.
\v 25 The first was red, and his whole body was covered with feathers. So they called him Esau.
\F + \fr 25:25 \fk Esau \ft The name Esau is almost the same as the Hebrew word meaning 'many feathers'. Another name for Esau is Edom, which means 'red'.
\F *
\v 26 And when the second son was born, his hand was holding his sister's heel. So they called him Jacob.
\F + \fr 25:26 \fk Jacob \ft The name 'Jacob' means 'holding the heel'. But the name can be understood as a figurative meaning 'cunning people' or 'scammers'.
\F * At the time of their birth, Isak was 60 years old.
\s1 Esau sells his birthright
\p
\v 27 When they had grown old, Esau became a hired man and lived in the fields. While Jacob became a quiet man and liked to stay in the camp.
\v 28 So Esau loved Esau because he liked to eat Esau's game, while Rebekah loved Jacob.
\p
\v 29 One day when Jacob was cooking soup, Esau returned from the field to hunt down and be tired.
\v 30 So Esau said to Jacob, "I am hungry! Give me some of the red soup. "(That is why Esau was given the nickname 'Edom', meaning 'red').
\p
\v 31 Jacob said to Esau, "Yes, but you must change it with your birthright."
\p
\v 32 Esau said, "I'm about to die! What's the use of the birthright for me ?! "
\p
\v 33 Jacob said, "Swear first that you will give me your birthright."
