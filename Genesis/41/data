\s1 The King of Egypt's Dream
\p
\v 1 Two years later the king of Egypt dreamed that he was standing by the side of the Nile River.
\v 2 In that dream, he saw seven cows that were healthy and fat come out of the Nile River and ate the grass that grew on the shore of the river.
\v 3 Then seven other cows that were thin and sickly came out of the Nile River and stood at the edge of the river together with the seven health cows.
\v 4 Then the seven thin cows ate the seven cows that were fat. After that the king awoke from his sleep.
\p
\v 5 Not long after that he fell asleep again and returned to dreaming. In his second dream, he saw seven heads of wheat grains growing on one stalk. Those seven heads of wheat grains were very good and full.
\v 6 Then seven other heads of wheat grew, that were withered and thin because of the gusts of the east wind.
\v 7 Then the seven heads of wheat grains that were thin swallowed the seven heads of grain that were good and full. And once again the king woke up and realized that it was just a dream.
\p
\v 8 The next day the king felt anxious. Then he called all of the expert magicians and wise men to tell his dreams to them. However there was not one of them who could interpret those dreams.
\v 9 Then the drink expert said to the king, “I just remembered about my wrong.
\v 10 At that time my Master King was very angry with several servants and put me and the head of the bread makers into the prison, which was under the supervision of the commander of the troops of the king's guards.
\v 11 One night, we both dreamed. And our dreams had individual meanings.
\v 12 There was a young Israelite there who had become servant to the commander of the king's guards. We told our dreams to him and he explained the meanings to us.
\v 13 And clearly everything that he said about our dreams really happened. I was returned to my position of responsibility in my work, and the palace bread expert received the death sentence.”
\p
\v 14 So the king of Egypt ordered to call Joseph. And quickly the guards took Joseph out of prison, shaved his beard and put clean clothing on him, then he was brought to face the king.
\v 15 The king said to Joseph, “I have dreamed but there is no one who is able to interpret them. I have heard that you can interpret dreams.”
\p
\v 16 Joseph answered, “My Master King, it isn't your servant who interprets those dreams. But God is the one who can give an answer that is correct about my Master King's dreams.”
\p
\v 17 Then the king told his dreams to Joseph, “In my dream I stood by the edge of the Nile River.
\v 18 And I saw seven cows that were healthy and fat come out of the Nile River and eat grass that grew beside the river.
\v 19 Then seven other cows that were thin and sickly came out of the River. That's the first I've seen such ugly cows in Egypt!
\v 20 Then the cows that were thin and sickly ate the first seven cows that were healthy and fat.
\v 21 And even though they had eaten the seven cows that were healthy and fat, those seven cows continued to look thin and sickly as ever. After that I just woke up.
\p
\v 22 Then I slept again and returned to dreaming. In the second dream I saw seven heads of wheat grains that were good and full, growing on one stalk of wheat.
\v 23 Then seven heads of grain grew but looked wilted and thinly dry because of being blown by the east wind.
\v 24 Then those seven heads of grain swallowed the seven previous heads of grain that were good. I have told all of my dreams to the expert majicians, but not one person among then could interpret my dreams.”
\p
\v 25 Then Joseph replied to him, “Your Majesty, the two dreams have the same meaning. God has told to my Master king what God will do.
\v 26 The seven cows that are healthy and the seven heads of grain that are good have the same meaning, that is seven years full of prosperity.
\v 27 Then the seven cows that were ugly, thin and sickly, and the seven heads of wheat grains that were wilted, thinly dry because of the east wind, are seven years of famine.
\v 28 This is what I mean by my previous words, ‘God has told to my Master King what God will do’.
\v 29 There will be seven years full of prosperity in all of Egypt.
\v 30-31 And after that, for the next seven years, there will be a famine in this land. That famine will be very severe and people will forget the time before that which was full of abundance.
\v 32 God has determined this situation will happen. My Master King has dreamed the same thing two times, which means it will happen soon.
\p
\v 33 Now it would be good if majesty searches for a wise person and one who can be trusted. Give him the task to manage all of the land.
\v 34 Beside that let my Master King also give the task to other officers to gather the harvest from the citizens of Egypt. For as long as the seven prosperous years, the people must give five percent of all of their harvest.
\v 35 In that way they can gather food as long as the harvest is abundant. And let my Master King put out the command so that that food is kept in several areas in the whole region of Egypt, until the time when it is needed.
\v 36 That is the spare food for the time of famine tht will happen in all of the land later. Only in this way, all of the residents of Egypt will remain alive.”
\s1 Joseph is commissioned as governor of Egypt
\p
\v 37 This (proposal) was considered to be good in the eyes of the king and the country's officials.
\v 38 Then the king said to the country's officials, “It's clear that there isn't anyone who is better than Joseph in handling this problem, because he is led by divine spirits.”\f + \fr 41:38 \fk divine spirits \ft In the Hebrew language it is written ‘elohom’, which has the plural form but usually is translated as singular in the OT. But in this story, the king of Egypt did not yet believe according to the religion of the Israelites about God being one. Because of that, it's best to use the plural form and not use a capital letter.\f*
\v 39 And the king said to Joseph, “Because God has shown all of this to you, I feel there is no one else wiser and more intelligent than you!
\v 40 You will manage[administrate] the whole palace and all of the citizens of Egypt. There will be no one more powerful than you except for me [as king].
\p
\v 41 In this, I raise you to become governor over all of Egypt.
\v 42 Then the king took off his ring that was the kingdom's seal from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. The king also gave him a gold necklace for his neck, and clothing made of fine linen cloth to be worn by Joseph.
\v 43 Then the king ordered Joseph to use the chariot that was usually used by the second most powerful person in Egypt. Escorted by a troop of king's guards, Joseph was brought around while proclaiming to all citizens that they had to kneel because Joseph had been raised to become the second most powerful person in Egypt.
\v 44 The king said to Joseph, “I am king of course! But no one else can acti in this land without your permission.”
\p
\v 45 Then the king gave a new name to Joseph— Zaphenath-paneah, and also gave a wife to him named Asenath. Asenath was the child of Potiphera— a priest of the son god Ra, from the city of Heliopolis\f + \fr 41:45, 50 \fk Heliopolis \ft another name for the city of On.\f*. So Joseph ruled over all of the Egyptian people.
\v 46 Joseph was thirty years old when he began to serve the king of Egypt. He was commissioned to rule the entire region of Egypt.
\p
\v 47 During the seven years full of prosperity, the harvests were very abundant.
\v 48 For the length of those seven years, in all of the region of Egypt, he gathered in every city the excess of harvest. In each city, Joseph built storage sheds and saved the harves from the fields from the surrounding area.
\v 49 Like the sand of the sea, the amount of harvested wheat was so abundant that Joseph wasn't able to count the amount.
\p
\v 50 Before the famine hit Egypt, Asenath (Joseph's wife) birthed two boy children. Asenath was the child of Potiphera, a priest of the sun god Ra, in Heliopolis.\f + \fr 41:50 \fk Heliopolis \ft See verse 41:45\f*
\v 51 And Joseph named his oldest child Manasseh, which means ‘God has made me forget all of the suffering along with my Father's family.’
\v 52 His second child was given the name Ephraim which means, ‘In the land of suffering, God has made me fruitful.’
\p
\v 53 The seven years time of preparation of abundant food ended.
\v 54 The seven years of famine just began as Joseph had said.
\v 55 When all of the Egyptian citizens were hungry, they cried out to the king asking for food. The king just ordered them to approach Joseph and do what he commanded.
\v 56 When the famine hit all the region of Egypt, Joseph opened the wheat storage sheds and sold to the residents of Egypt. The famine was very severe in all of Egypt.
\v 57 In fact residents from other people groups came to Joseph to buy wheat because the famine was so severe that it spread to the whole earth.
