\s1 The King of Egypt's Dream
\p
\v 1 Two years later the king of Egypt dreamed that he was standing by the side of the Nile River.
\v 2 In that dream, he saw seven cows that were healthy and fat come out of the Nile River and eat the grass on the shore of the river.
\v 3 Then seven other cows that were thin and sickly also came out of the Nile River and stood at the edge of the river together with the seven health cows.
\v 4 Then the seven cows that were thin ate the seven cows that were fat. After that the king awoke from his sleep.
\p
\v 5 He fell back asleep and dreamed again. In his second dream, he saw seven heads of wheat grains growing on one stalk. Those seven heads of wheat grains were very good and full.
\v 6 Then he saw seven other heads of wheat grow, but wilted and thinly dry because of the gusts of the east wind that was hot and dry.
\v 7 Then the seven heads of wheat grains that were thin swallowed the seven heads of grain that were good and full. And the king once again woke up and realized that he was only dreaming.
\p
\v 8 The next morning the king felt anxious. Because of that he called all of the expert magicians and wise men in Egypt, then he told his dreams to them. However there was not one of them who could interpret those dreams.
\v 9 Then the drink expert said to the king, “Today I just remembered about my wrong.
\v 10 At that time my Master King was very angry with several servants, so I and the head of the bread makers were put into prison under the supervision of the commander of the king's guards.
\v 11 One night, we both dreamed and each of those dreams had meanings.
\v 12 There was a young Hebrew there who had become servant to the commander of the king's guards. We told those dreams to him, and he explained the meanings to us.
\v 13 And everything happened like he said: I was returned to my position of responsibility in my work and the bread expert was punished with death by being impaled on a pole.”
\p
\v 14 So the king ordered to call Joseph. And quickly Joseph was let out of prison. After shaving his beard and putting on clean clothing, Joseph went to face the king.
\v 15 The king said to Joseph, “I have dreamed but there is no one who is able to interpret them. I have heard that you can interpret dreams.”
\p
\v 16 Joseph answered, “You/Sir, it isn't a servant who is able to interpret those dreams. Only God is the one who can give the meaning of dreams to help you.”
\p
\v 17 Then the king told his dreams to Joseph, “In my dream I stood by the edge of the Nile River.
\v 18 And I saw there were seven cows that were healthy and fat come out of the Nile River and eat grass that grew beside the river.
\v 19 Then seven other cows that were thin and sickly came out of the river. That's the first I've seen such ugly cows in Egypt!
\v 20 Then the cows that were thin and sickly ate the seven cows that were healthy and fat.
\v 21 And even though they had eaten the seven cows that were healthy and fat, those seven cows continued to look thin and sickly. After that I woke up.
\p
\v 22 Then I slept again and returned to dreaming. In this second dream, I saw seven heads of wheat grains that were good and also full, growing on one stalk of wheat.
\v 23 Then seven other heads of grain grew, but looked wilted and thinly dry because of being blown by the east wind that is hot and dry.
\v 24 Then those seven heads of grain that were wilted swallowed the seven previous heads of grain that were good. I have told all of these dreams to the expert magicians, but not one person among them was able to interpret them.”
\p
\v 25 Then Joseph replied to the king, “These two dreams have the same meaning. God has told to you/Sir what will be done by Him.
\v 26 The seven cows that are healthy and also the seven heads of grain that are good have the same meaning, that is seven years that are full of prosperity.
\v 27 Then the seven cows that were ugly, thin and sickly, and the seven heads of wheat grains that were wilted, thinly dry because of the east wind, mean seven years of famine.
\v 28 This is what I mean by my previous words, ‘God has told you what will be done by Him’.
\v 29 There will be seven years full of prosperity in all of Egypt.
\v 30-31 And after that, for the next seven years, there will be a famine in this land. That famine will be very severe and people will forget the time before that which was full of abundance.
\v 32 God has determined this situation will happen. The two times you/Sir have dreamed with the same meaning, which means this thing will happen soon.
\p
\v 33 Now, it would be good if you search for a person who is smart and wise. Give him the task to manage all of the land of Egypt.
\v 34 Beside that may you/Sir also give the task to other officers to gather the harvest from the citizens of Egypt. For as long as the seven prosperous years, the people must give a twenty percent of all of their harvest.
\v 35 In that way they can gather grain for the seven years that are abundant. And may you/Sir put out the command, so that that food is kept in several cities in the whole region of Egypt and guarded well.
\v 36 That is the spare food for the time of famine that will happen in all of the land later. Only in this way, all of the residents of Egypt will remain alive.”
\s1 Joseph becomes second in authority in Egypt
\p
\v 37 Joseph's proposal was considered to be good in the eyes of the king and his officials.
\v 38 Then the king said to his officials, “It's clear that there isn't anyone who is able to handle this problem better than Joseph, because he is led by divine spirits.”\f + \fr 41:38 \fk divine spirits \ft In the Hebrew language, ‘elohom’, means 'God’ in the plural, but usually is translated as singular in the OT. In this verse the TSI translates ‘elohom’ as ‘divine spirits’, because the king of Egypt did not believe in the One God.\f*
\v 39 And the king said to Joseph, “Because divine spirits have shown all of this to you, I feel there is no one else wiser and more intelligent than you!
\v 40 You will have authority over the whole kingdom and all of the citizens of Egypt. There will be no one more powerful than you except for me as king.
\p
\v 41 In this, I raise you to become second in authority over all of Egypt.
\v 42 Then the king took off his ring with the kingdom's seal from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. The king also gave him clothing made of fine linen and a gold necklace to be worn by Joseph.
\v 43 Then the king ordered Joseph to use the chariot that was usually used by the second most powerful person in Egypt. A troop of king's guards escorted Joseph around, while proclaiming to all citizens that they had to kneel, because Joseph had been raised to become the second most powerful person in Egypt.
\v 44 The king said to Joseph, “I am king of course! But no one else can act in this land without your permission.”
\p
\v 45 Then the king gave Joseph a new name, Zaphenath-paneah, and also gave a wife to him named Asenath. Asenath was the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of the sun god, from the city of Heliopolis.\f + \fr 41:45, 50 \fk Heliopolis \ft another name for the city of On.\f* So Joseph ruled over all of the Egyptian people.
\v 46 Joseph was thirty years old when he began to serve the king of Egypt. He was commissioned to rule the entire region of Egypt.
\p
\v 47 During the seven years that were prosperous, the harvests were very abundant.
\v 48 In that time, Joseph gathered all the excess of harvest in the region of Egypt in the cities. In each city, Joseph built storage sheds and saved the harvest from the fields from the surrounding area.
\v 49 The harvested wheat was abundant like the sand of the sea so that Joseph was no longer able to count the amount.
\p
\v 50 Before the famine hit Egypt, Asenath the wife of Joseph birthed two sons. Asenath was the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of the sun god Ra, from Heliopolis.
\v 51 And Joseph named his oldest child Manasseh,\f + \fr 41:51 \fk Manasseh \ft The meaning of the name Manasseh is ‘to cause to forget’.\f* because he said, ‘God has made me forget all of the suffering and my Father's family.’
\v 52 His second child was given the name Ephraim\f + \fr 41:52 \fk Ephraim \ft The meaning of the name Ephraim is ‘to bear fruit’ or ’to succeed’.\f* because he said, ‘In the land of suffering, God has made me fruitful.’
\p
\v 53 The seven years time of prosperity in Egypt ended.
\v 54 Famine for seven years began, just as Joseph had said. Starvation occurred is all the land, but in Egypt there was bread.
\v 55 When all of the Egyptian citizens were hungry, they cried out to the king asking for food. The king just ordered them to approach Joseph and do what he commanded.
\v 56 When the famine hit all the region of Egypt, Joseph opened the wheat storage sheds and sold it to the residents of Egypt. The famine was very severe in all of Egypt.
\v 57 In fact residents from other people groups came to Joseph to buy wheat because the famine was very severe and it spread to the whole earth.
