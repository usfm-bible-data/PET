\s1 Isaac deceives
\p
\v 1 Not much later there was a famine in that land, like what had happened in Abraham's time. Because of that, for a while Isaac— with all that he owned, moved to Gerar, that is a district of Abimelek's authority, a Philistine king.
\v 2 Then the LORD showed himself to him and said, "Don't go to Egypt! Remain in the land that I will show to you.
\v 3 Stay in this land as a foreigner, then I will be with you and bless you. I will give all of this area to you and to your descendants. I will fulfill My promise to your father Abraham.
\v 4 I will give you very many descendants— like as many as stars in the sky. I will give all of this area to them, and they will become a blessing for all people groups on earth.
\v 5 I do this because previously your father Abraham always obeyed My sayings, instructions, orders, determinations, and laws.
\p
\v 6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
\v 7 It happened that his wife— Rebekah, was very beautiful. Because of that when men of Gerar asked about Rebekah, he always answered, "She' my younger sibling." Isaac answered like that because he thought, "It might be among them one who plans to murder me to get Rebekah."
\v 8 One day, after Isaac lived there for awhile, Abimelech looked out of his palace window. Suddenly he saw Isaac and Rebekah making out.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, "Now I know that she is your wife! Then why did you say that she was your younger sibling?"
\p
\v 10 Then Abimelech said, "You should not have done this thing to us! It might have happened that a person among us slept with your wife, then you would have caused all of our people group to bear the punishment for that great sin!"
\v 11 Then Abimelech gave a warning to his people, "Whoever bothers this man or his wife will be sentenced to die!"
\s1 The Philistines debate with Isaac about wells
\p
\v 12 Isaac planted wheat in that land, and in that year too he received produce or harvest one hundredfold, because the LORD truly blessed him.
\v 13 Isaac's wealth increase much so that he became a very rich person.
\v 14 Then the Philistine people became envious of him because he owned much livestock— that is flocks of sheep and goats, oxen and cattle, and also owned many servants.
\v 15 Because of that, the Philistine people closed all of the wells that had been dug earlier by Abraham's servants. The closed the wells with dirt.
\p
\v 16 And finally Abimelech said to Isaac, "I request you and your slaves to move from my kingdom, because your power is to great compared to us who are the original residents of this place."
\v 17 So Isaac and all of the people he owned moved from that place. They went and camped in the Gerar valley and then lived there.
\v 18 There were several wells in that place that had been dug earlier by Abrahams slaves, but after Abraham left the wells mentioned were closed by the Philistine people with dirt. So after returning there, Isaacs servants dug those wells again. Isaac named each of the wells like the name that had been given previously by his father.
\p
\v 19 Isaac's servants also dug another well in that valley, and they found a spring of water that gushed water
\v 20 But the residents who lived and shepherded sheep in the Gerar valley fought with the shepherds who watched the herds of sheep and cows owned by Isaac.
