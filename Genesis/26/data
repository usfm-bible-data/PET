\c 26
\s1 Isaac deceives
\p
\v 1 Some time later there was a famine in that land, like what had happened in Abraham's time. Because of that for a while Isaac with all that he owned moved to Gerar— which was a district of Abimelech's authority, the Philistine king.
\v 2 Then the LORD showed himself to him and said, "Don't go to Egypt! Remain in the land that I will show to you.
\v 3 Stay in this land as a new-comer, then I will be with you and bless you. I will give all of this area to you and to your descendants. I will fulfill My covenant with your father Abraham.
\v 4 I will give you very many descendants— like as many as stars in the sky. I will give all of this area to them, and they will become a blessing for all races/nations on earth.
\v 5 I do this because previously your father Abraham always obeyed My words, instructions, orders, determinations, and laws.”
\p
\v 6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
\v 7 It happened that his wife Rebekah was very beautiful. Because of that when men of Gerar asked about Rebekah, he always answered, “She's my younger sibling.” Isaac was afraid to answer, “That's my wife,” because he thought, “It might be among them one who plans to murder me to get Rebekah.”
\v 8 One day, after Isaac lived there for awhile, Abimelech looked out of his palace window. Suddenly he saw Isaac and Rebekah making out.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “Now I know that she is your wife! Then why did you say that she was your younger sibling?”
\p Isaac answered, “I said like that because I thought, ‘If I say that Rebekah is my wife, certainly I will be killed (by someone) in order to get her.’”
\p
\v 10 Then Abimelech said, “You should not have done this thing to us! It might have happened that a person among us slept with your wife, then you would have caused all of our nation to bear the punishment for that great sin!”
\v 11 Then Abimelech gave a warning to his people, “Whoever bothers this man or his wife will be sentenced to die!”
\s1 The Philistines argue with Isaac about wells
\p
\v 12 Isaac planted wheat in that land, and in that year too he harvested one hundredfold, because the LORD very much blessed him.
\v 13 Isaac's wealth increased much so that he became a very rich person.
\v 14 Then the Philistine people became envious of him because he owned much livestock— that is flocks and herds of sheep and goats, oxen and cattle, and also owned many servants.
\v 15 Because of that, the Philistine people closed all of the wells that had been dug earlier by Abraham's servants. They closed the wells with dirt.
\p
\v 16 And finally Abimelech said to Isaac, “I request you and all your slaves to move from my kingdom, because your power is too great compared to us who are the original residents of this place.”
\v 17 So Isaac and all of the people he owned moved from that place. They went and camped in the Gerar valley and then lived there.
\v 18 There were several wells in that place that had been dug earlier by Abraham's slaves, but after Abraham died the wells mentioned were closed by the Philistine people with dirt. So after returning there, Isaac's servants dug those wells again. Isaac named each of the wells like the name that had been given previously by his father.
\p
\v 19 Isaac's servants also dug another well in that valley, and they found a spring of water that gushed water
\v 20 But the residents who lived and shepherded sheep in the Gerar valley fought with the shepherds who watched the herds of sheep and cows owned by Isaac. They said, “This is our water!” Then Isaac named that well Esek— which means ‘dispute’, because in that place the people fought with his shepherds.
\p
\v 21 Then Isaac's servants dug another well again, but arguments still happened again about who owned that well. Because of that, Isaac named that well Sitna, which means, ‘Hostility’.
\v 22 They moved from there and dug another well, but this time no arguing occured. Isaac named that well Rehoboth, which means ‘free place’, because he said, “The LORD has given us a free area for us to live. We will prosper here.”
\p
\v 23 From there Isaac went to Beersheba.
\v 24 The first night there, the LORD showed himself and said to him, “I am God who was worshiped by your father Abraham. Don't be afraid. I will help you and bless you. In accordance with My promise to My servant Araham, I will multiply the number of your descendants.”
\v 25 Then Isaac built an altar and worshiped the LORD in that place. He also built his encampment, and his servants dug a well.
\s1 Isaac makes a covenant of peace with King Abimelech
\p
\v 26 While they were digging the well, King Abimelech came from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his advisor, and also Phicol his war general.
\v 27 Isaac said to them, “Why do you (come to) meet with me? Didn't you hate me before this and chase me out of your area?”
\p
\v 28 One of them answered, “It is clear to us that the LORD is with you. So we think that it's best that we make a covenant of peace between us.
\v 29 Promise us that you won't attack us, just as we haven't ever attacked you. We have always treated you well and allowed you to leave peacefully. And look how unusually the LORD has blessed you!”
\v 30 Then Isaac made a feast with them, and they all ate and drank.
\v 31 Very early the next morning Abimelech and Isaac legalized a covenant of peace by mutually swearing. After that Abimelech said fairwell (before departing for home), and Isaac wished safe travels to them.
\p
\v 32 On that day also Isaac's servants came telling him about the well that they had finished digging. They said, “We've found water!”
\v 33 So Isaac named that well Sheba, which means ‘Swear’. Until now that city is named Beersheba which means ‘Well of the Peace Covenant’.
\s1 Esau marries two foreign women
\p
\v 34 When Esau was forty years old, he married two women from the Hittite tribe— that is Judith the child of Beeri, and Basemath the child of Elon.
\v 35 The two wives of Esau created bitterness of heart for Isaac and Rebekah.
