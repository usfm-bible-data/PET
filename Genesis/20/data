\s Abraham lied to Abimelek regarding Sara
\p
\v 1 Then Abraham left the land owned by Mamre and moved to the southern part of the land of Canaan, in the territory of the Philistines. On his journey, he lived temporarily between Kades and Syur, and then moved to Gerar. While in Gerar,
\v 2 Abraham did not admit honestly to the Gerar people that Sara was his wife. Instead he said, “She is my younger sister.” Because of that Abimelech,\f + \fr 20:2 \fk Abimelech … \ft The name Abimelech could mean “The (respected) king is my father,” or “Father is king.” There are two Philistine kings in the Bible who referred to as Abimelech. Actually Abimelech is the title for the office of king, similar to how ‘pharaoh’ means ‘king’ in Egyptian, and ‘caesar’ means ‘king’ in Latin.\f* king of Gerar, told some of his men to bring Sara to him in the palace.
\p
\v 3 But one night God showed himself to Abimelech through a dream and said, “Listen! I will sentence you to death because the woman you took already has a husband.”
\p
\v 4 Because Abimelech did not yet have intercourse with Sara, he said, , “My lord, I and my nation are not guilty at all! Will you still destroy a nation that is not guilty?
\v 5 It was Abraham himself who said that the woman is his sister, and the woman said so too! So I did all this with a sincere and innocent heart!”
\p
\v 6 Then in the dream God said to him, “I know that you do it with a sincere heart. That is why I prevent you from sinning against Me by not allowing you to touch that woman.
\v 7 So now return her to Abraham, because Abraham is a prophet and he will pray for you so that you will continue to live. But if you don't return that woman, then know this, you and all your people will die!”
\p
\v 8 So the next morning, Abimelech called all his kingdom officials and told them about all that had happened. When they heard about it, they were very scared.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “You have lied to me! What was my offense against you so that you brought such a great disaster against me and my people?! It really was inappropriate for you to do that!
\v 10 What made you do that?”
\p
\v 11 Abraham answered, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no one who respects God in this place. If I say that she is my wife, certainly I would be killed in order to get her.’
\v 12 After all, she is indeed my half sister. We are one father but different mothers, and then I married her.
\v 13 So when God told me to leave my father's house to wander in the lands of other people, I said to her, ‘Show your loyalty to me wherever we go, by telling anyone that I am your brother.’”
\p
\v 14 After that Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham. He also gave a few sheep and cows, and a few male slaves and female slaves.
\v 15 He said to Abraham, “Please choose any place you like out of all of my kingdom for you to occupy.”
\v 16 Then he said to Sarah, “Look, I have given 1,000 silver shekels\f + \fr 20:16 \fk 1,000 silver shekels \ft If converted to kilograms, the weight of 1,000 pieces of sliver was approximately 11.4 kilogram.\f* to your brother. That is the fine that I have to pay to cover all these wrongs in everyone's eyes and to protect your reputation.”
\p
\v 17-18 Because of that incident, the LORD had made all the women in Abimelech's palace to become barren. But when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech, his wife and female slaves so that they could become pregnant again.
