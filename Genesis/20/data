\s Abraham lied to Abimelek regarding Sara
\p
\v 1 Then Abraham left Mamre and moved to the southern part of the land of Canaan. There he stayed for a while in a place called Gerar - which was located between Kades and Syur.
\v 2 Abraham did not admit clearly to the Gerar people that Sara was his wife. Instead he said, “She is my younger sibling.” Because of that Abimelech,\f + \fr 20:2 \fk Abimelek ... \ft The name Abimelek could mean “The (respected) king is my father,” or “Father is king.” There are two Philistine kings in the Bible who referred to as Abimelek. Actually Abimelek is the title for the office of king, similar to how ‘pharaoh’ means ‘king’ in Egyptian, and ‘caesar’ means ‘king’ in Latin.\f* king of Gerar, told some of his men to bring Sara to him in the palace.
\p
\v 3 But one night God showed himself to Abimelek through a dream and said, “Listen! I will sentence you to death because the woman you took already has a husband.”
\p
\v 4 Because Abimelech had not had intercourse with Sara, he said, ,“Lord, I and my nation are not at all guilty! Will you still destroy a nation that is innocent?
\v 5 It was Abraham himself who said that the woman is his sister, and the woman said so too! So I did all this with a upright and innocent heart!”
\p
\v 6 Then in the dream God said to him, “I know that you do it with an upright heart. That is why I prevent you from sinning against Me by not allowing you to touch her.
\v 7 So now return her to Abraham, because Abraham is a prophet and he will pray for you so that you will continue living. But if you don't return the woman, then know: You and all your people will die!”
\p
\v 8 So the next morning, Abimelek called all his employees and told them about all that had happened. When they heard about that, they were very scared.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “You lied to me! What was my offense against you so that you brought such a great disaster against me and my people?! It really was inappropriate for you to do that!
\v 10 What made you do that?”
\p
\v 11 Abraham answered, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no one who respects God in this place. If I say that she is my wife, certainly I would be killed in order to get her.’
\v 12 After all, he is indeed my half sister. We are one father but different mothers, and then I married her.
\v 13 So when God told me to leave my father's house to go wandering to the lands of other peoples, I said to her, ‘Show your loyalty to me wherever we go, by telling anyone that I am your brother.’”
\p
\v 14 After that Abimelech returned Sara to Abraham. He also gave several sheep and cows, and several male slaves and female slaves.
\v 15 He said to Abraham, “Please choose any place you like out of all of my kingdom to occupy.”
\v 16 Then he said to Sara, “Look, I have given a thousand shekels\f + \fr 20:16 \fk a thousand shekels \ft If converted to kilograms, the weight of 1,000 silver coins was approximately 11.4 kg.\f* to your brother. That is a fine that I had to pay to cover all these mistakes in everyone's eyes and so that you don't feel a loss of face.”
\p
\v 17-18 Because of that incident, the LORD had made all the women in Abimelek's palace to become barren. But when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech, and his wife and slave girls so they could become pregnant again.
