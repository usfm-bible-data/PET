\v 4 I will accompany you to Egypt and some time later will bring your descendants out of Egypt, and back to Canaan. Joseph will be with you when you die.”

\s1 Jacob's family arrives in Goshen
\p
\v 28 Before they arrived in Goshen, Judah was sent to go earlier to face Joseph to get directions (on what they needed to do in Goshen.)
\v 29 Joseph was waiting in the chariot of his greatness in Goshen when Jacob and his party arrived. Joseph just greeted him then hugged and cried in his father's embrace.
\v 30 Israel was the name that was given by God to Jacob (and he just) said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die because I've seen your face, and clearly you are still alive.”
\p
\v 31 Joseph then delivered this message to his brothers and all of Jacob's family, “I will go before the king of Egypt to tell his highness that father, my brothers along with all the members of my extended family have arrived from Canaan.
\v 32 I will also deliver that you all have brought all of your herds of livestock here.
\v 33-34 If the king asks what is your livelihood, you all should answer that since the time of childhood, you all herded sheep and now your livelihood is as breeders. In that way you all will be permitted to live and herd livestock in Goshen. For Egyptians, the livelihood as breeders is considered to be lowly.”
