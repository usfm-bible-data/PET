\p
\v 3 God spoke to him, “I am God, the God of your father. Don't be afraid to go to Egypt, for there I will make your descendants a great nation.
\v 4 I will accompany you to Egypt and some time later will bring your descendants out of Egypt, and back to Canaan. Joseph will be with you when you die.”

\s1 Jacob's family arrives in Goshen
\p
\v 28 Before they arrived in Goshen, Judah was sent to go earlier to face Joseph to get directions about the place prepared for them in the region of Goshen. When Jacob’s party arrived there,
\v 29 Joseph ordered that his chariot be prepared and he went to receive his father. At the moment they met, Joseph hugged his neck and cried for a long time.
\v 30 Israel (who was also called Jacob said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die because I've seen your face, and it turns out that you are still alive!”
\p
\v 31 Joseph then delivered this message to his brothers and all of Jacob's family, “I will go before the king of Egypt to tell his highness that father, my brothers along with all the members of my extended family have arrived from Canaan.
\v 32 I will also deliver that you(pl) shepherd livestock and have brought here all of your herds of livestock and all your other valuables.
\v 33 If the king asks, ‘What is your livelihood,’
\v 34 you all must answer, ‘Since we were little children, we have shepherded livestock, just like our ancestors.’ In that way you all will be permitted to settle and shepherd livestock in Goshen. Joseph ordered them to answer like that because for Egyptians, the livelihood of cattle shepherds is despised.”
