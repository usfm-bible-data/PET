\s1 Final Test
\p
\v 1 After that, Joseph said to the head manager of the household, “Fill these peoples' sacks with as many food supplies as they are able to carry, and place their money payment in each of their sacks.
\v 2 For the sack owned by their youngest sibling put my silver cup, and also his money payment.”
\p
\v 3 The next day. when it was still dawn, the head manager of the household ordered them to leave quickly.
\v 4 But as they had just gone out of the city, and not yet very far, Joseph said to the head manager of his household, “Quickly chase them! And after you catch up to them, say to them, ‘Our master was very good to you all, but instead you all return his kindness by stealing his silver cup!
\v 5 That silver cup isn't used just for drinking, but also to foretell the future. You've done evil!’”
\p
\v 6 Then the head manager of the household just chased them, and after succeeding, he said to them exactly as Joseph said to him.
\v 7 But they said to him, "Pa, why do you speak like that? These servants didn't possibly do an evil thing like that.
\v 8 You yourself know that when we came back from Canaan, we returned the money payment that was found in our sacks. For what purpose would we steal gold or silver from your Master's house?
\v 9 If Father finds that object in the sack of one of us let him be sentenced to death and we others will become slaves.”
\p
\v 10 The head manager of that household said, “Alright, according to the punishment that you yourselves have determined, so if that object is found, the owner of that sack will become a slave for my Master, and the others will be permitted to go.”
\p
\v 11 They quickly opened each of their sacks.
\v 12 Then the head helper examined all of the sacks, beginning from the oldest, until finally at the youngest. The silver cup was found in the sack owned by Benjamin.
\v 13 His oldest siblings immediately tore their clothing as a sign of mourning, then, returned their cargo to the sacks on their donkeys and returned toward the city.
\v 14 Joseph was still at his house when Judah and his brothers returned and bowed before him.
\p
\v 15 Joseph said to them, “What have you done? Didn't you all know that a person like me certainly knows what is hidden?
\p
\v 16 “My Master, what can we say?” answered Judah, “How can we prove that we are righteous? God has revealed our wrong, so not just in the sacks of whom that object was found, but we all will become your Honor's slaves.”
\p
\v 17 Joseph answered, “In the sack of whom my silver cup was found, he is the one who will become my slave. The others may return to your father.
\s1 Judah defends Benjamin
\p
\v 18 Judah approached and said to Joseph, “Your Honor, may your servant speak. Don't let your anger burn. Only you have power other than the king.
\p
\v 19 Your honor had asked us if we have a father or a younger sibling.
\v 20 We just answered that we have a father who is already very old. And in his old age, he had two more children, one has already died and the younger sibling from the same mother is left, and our father really loves him.
\v 21 Then Master had said to us, ‘Bring your younger sibling so that I can see him.’
\v 22 We told my Master, that that child can't be separated from his father, because if so, then father will die.
\v 23 Then your honor said that we wouldn't be permitted to face you if we didn't bring our younger sibling.
\v 24 When home, we delivered your honor's message to our father.
\v 25 Then father ordered us to return to buy food supplies.
\v 26 But we said that it wouldn't be possible to face your honor without bringing our younger sibling because that was the message from yourself, your honor.
\v 27 Then your servant said, that is our father, ‘You all know that my wife, Rachel birthed two boy children.
\v 28 At the time one of them died, I said, “It's certain he was torn to pieces by a wild animal,” and since that moment, I never saw him again.
\v 29 Now you all want to bring my youngest child from before me. If something happens to him, then I will languish until the day of my death.’
\p
\v 30 Judah continued, “Your honor, now what will happen if we return to our parent's house without bringing our youngest sibling? He is that important to the life of our father.
\v 31 If father sees our youngest sibling isn't with your servants, then he will die, and we will be blamed. We become the reason for the feeling of deep grief in his old age so that he dies.
\v 32 As a guarantee to father, your servant has promised to bring home our youngest sibling. If he doesn't go home, I will be blamed by our father forever.
\v 33 For that reason, your servant begs to be the replacement for our younger sibling. Permit our younger sibling to go home with his other older siblings.
\v 34 How can we possibly witness the great mourning of our father if return without our younger sibling?!”
