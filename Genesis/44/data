\s1 Final Test
\p
\v 1 After that, Joseph said to the head manager of the household, “Fill these peoples' sacks with as much food supplies as they are able to carry, and place their money payment in each of their sacks.
\v 2 For the sack owned by their youngest sibling put my silver cup, and also his money payment.” So the head manager of his house did according as ordered by Joseph.
\p
\v 3 The next day, when it was still dawn, the brothers of Joseph were allowed to leave with their donkeys.
\v 4 But as they had just gone out of the city, and not yet very far, Joseph said to the head manager of his household, “Chase them, and after you catch up to them, say to them, ‘Our master was very good to you(pl), but instead you return his kindness by stealing his silver cup!
\v 5 What an evil thing you(pl) have done! That silver cup isn't used just for drinking, but also to foretell the future.’”
\p
\v 6 Then the head manager of the household just chased them, and then said to them whtsat Joseph had said to him.
\v 7 But they said to him, “Sir, why do you speak like that? We your servants would never do an evil thing like that!
\v 8 You yourself know that when we came back from Canaan, we returned the money payment that was found in our sacks. For what purpose would we steal gold or silver from your Master's house?
\v 9 If you Sir finds that object in the sack of one of us let him be sentenced to death and we others will become your slaves.”
\p
\v 10 The head manager of that household said, “Alright, according to the punishment that you yourselves have determined, so if that object is found, the owner of that sack will become my slave , and the others will be permitted to go.”
\p
\v 11 They quickly opened each of their sacks from each of their donkeys and opened them.
\v 12 Then the head helper examined all of the sacks, beginning from the oldest, until finally at the youngest. The silver cup was found in the sack owned by Benjamin.
\v 13 His oldest siblings immediately tore their clothing as a sign of mourning, then, returned their cargo to the sacks on their donkeys and returned to the city.
\v 14 Joseph was still at his house when Judah and his brothers returned and prostrated themselves with their face to the ground before him.
\p
\v 15 Joseph said to them, “Why did you do that?! Didn't you all know that a person like me can divine what is hidden?”
\p
\v 16 Then Judah answered, “Master, we can’t say a thing! We can’t prove that we are righteous. God has revealed our wrong. Because of that— not just the owner of the sack alone where that object was found— but we all will become your slaves!”
\p
\v 17 Joseph answered, “No! I will not do such a thing. To the one in whose sack my silver cup was found, he is the one who will become my slave. The others may return safely to your father.”
\s1 Judah wanted to change places with Benjamin
\p
\v 18 Judah approached and said to Joseph, “Sir, (please) permit your servant to speak. Don't let your anger burn, because I know that You/Sir alone have big power like the king.
\v 19 You/Sir had asked us if we have a father or a younger sibling.
\v 20 We indeed answered that we have a father who is already very old. And in his old age he had two more sons from his wife named Rachel. One has already died, leaving the younger sibling. That is why our father really loves him.
\v 21 Then Master had said to us, ‘Bring your younger sibling so that I can see him.’
\v 22 We told you/Sir that that child can't be separated from his father, because if so, then father will die.
\v 23 Then you/Sir said that we wouldn't be permitted to face you if we didn't bring our younger sibling.
\v 24 When home, we delivered your message to our father.
\v 25 Then father ordered us to come here again to buy food supplies.
\v 26 But we said that it wouldn't be possible to face you/Sir without bringing our younger sibling, because that was the message from yourself, Sir.
\v 27 Then your servant said, that is our father, ‘You all know that my wife, Rachel birthed two boy children.
\v 28 At the time one of them died, I said, “It's certain he was torn to pieces by a wild animal,” and since that moment, I never saw him again.
\v 29 Now you all want to bring my youngest child from before me. If something happens to him, then I will mourn until I die.’”
\p
\v 30 Judah continued, “So now what will happen if we return to our parent's house without bringing our youngest sibling? He is so meaningful to the life of our father.
\v 31 If father sees our youngest sibling isn't with use, your servants, then he will die, and we will be blamed. We will have become the reason for the deep grief in his old age so that he dies.
\v 32 As a guarantee to father, your servant has promised to bring home our youngest sibling. If he doesn't go home, I will be blamed by our father forever.
\v 33 For that reason, your servant begs to be the replacement for our younger sibling. Permit our younger sibling to go home with his other older siblings.
\v 34 I am not able (to bear) witnessing the great mourning of our father if I return without bringing our younger sibling!”
