\s1 Joseph's siblings return to Egypt
\p
\v 1 The famine became more severe.
\v 2 After their supply of food was gone, Jacob said to his children, “Go to Egypt to buy a few food supplies.”
\p
\v 3 Judah answered, “Father, that ruler of Egypt warned us sternly to not approach him if we don't bring Benjamin.
\v 4 If Father permits him to go along, then we will leave quickly [to Egypt to buy wheat].
\v 5 If Father doesn't permit him to go along, then we can't go because that ruler said that we are not allowed to approach him without our younger sibling.”
\p
\v 6 Jacob said, “Why did you all make it harder for me by telling that person that you all have a younger sibling?”
\p
\v 7 They answered “That person asked us carefully about ourselves and our family like this, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you all have a younger sibling?’ Because of that we answered him. How could we know he would order us to bring Benjamin?”
\p
\v 8 Judah said to their father, “Permit Benjamin to go along and we will leave quickly. I will be responsible for him. If not, we will all die of hunger.
\v 9 I will guarantee that he remains alive. If I don't bring him back safely, let me bear the punishment for it as long as I live.
\v 10 Supposing at that time father had allowed us to go, we would certainly have already gone and come back home two times to Egypt to buy food supplies.
\p
\v 11 Jacob replied, “If that is really so don't go with empty hands. Bring as a gift to that ruler the best produce of this land, that is honey, nuts,\f + \fr 43:11 \fk nuts \ft The two kinds of nuts which Jacob mentioned are delicious tree seeds, and which are translated in the TB as ‘hazelnuts/pecans’ and ‘almonds’. But most readers of the TSI are not familiar with those two. Rather than ‘hazel nuts’ most translations in English translate ‘pistachio nuts’, or buah pistasi. ‘Badam’ in English is ‘almond’.\f* and spices from tree sap.\f + \fr 43:11 \fk … tree sap \ft In literal English, ‘aromatic gum (sap from the rockwood plant), balm (sap from the mastic tree), and myrrh’.\f*
\v 12 Bring two times the money because you must return the money that was returned in your sacks. Maybe that was a mistake.
\v 13 Bring your younger sibling to meet that person and return quickly.
\v 14 May Almighty God make that man have mercy on you all, so that you along with Benjamin and Simeon return to me. But if I have to lose my other children, let that happen.”
\p
\v 15 So they left with Benjamin for Egypt bringing a gift from their land along with two times the money as payment. After they arrived there, they went and approached Joseph.
\p
\v 16 When Joseph saw Benjamin together with them, he quickly ordered the head manager of the household, “Bring these people to my house. Slaughter and cook an animal because this afternoon they will eat with me.”
\v 17 The head manager of that household did according to what was ordered by Joseph. He brought them to Joseph's house.
\p
\v 18 When they were brought to Joseph's house, they were afraid and said, “We have been brought here because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time we came here. Maybe now we will be made slaves and our donkeys will be taken.”
\s1 The dinner at Joseph's house
\p
\v 19 When they arrived at the door of Joseph's house, they approached the head manager of the household and said,
\v 20 “Father, we previously came here to buy wheat.
\v 21 On our journey home, when we stopped for the night, we each opened our sacks that we carried and found all our payment money was in the sack. But now we have brought that money to be returned.
\v 22 We don't know who put that money in our sacks. This time we brought extra money to buy more food supplies.”
\p
\v 23 The head manager of the household said, “Don't worry. Your God— the God your father worships has certainly returned that money. The matter of payment at that time, I have already received.” Then he brought Simeon to them.
\p
\v 24 Then he took them into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and also gave food to their donkeys.
\v 25 Then they prepared the gift items that would be given to Joseph, when he came home to eat lunch with them.
\p
\v 26 Joseph came home and they approached him while bowing to surrender their gift.
\v 27 Joseph asked about their situation, then he said, “How is the situation with your father that you talked about before? Is he still alive?”
\p
\v 28 They answered, “Your servant—our father, is still alive and his situation is just fine.” Then they bowed before him.
\p
\v 29 When Joseph saw Benjamin, he said, “Is this the younger sibling that you had talked about? May God bless you, my child.”
\v 30 Because he couldn't hold back his feeling of love and longing for his younger sibling, Joseph quickly entered his room and cried.
\v 31 After washing his face, Joseph went out and while controlling his feelings, he ordered that dinner be served.
\p
\v 32 The servants had prepared a table for Joseph alone, another table for his older and younger siblings and another table for the Egyptians who also ate with them. This thing was done because the Egyptian people considered it contemptible if they had to eat together with Hebrew people.
\v 33 Joseph's brothers sat facing him, arranged according to their birth order, beginning with the oldest down to the youngest. When they realized this, they looked at each other in surprise.
\v 34 Their food was served from Joseph's table. Benjamin was served food and drink five times more than his older siblings. Joseph and his brothers ate and drank until satisfied.
