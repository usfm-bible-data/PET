\s1 The Journey of Joseph's two brothers to Egypt
\p
\v 1 The famine became more severe.
\v 2 After their supply of food was gone, Jacob said to his children, “Go to Egypt to buy a few food supplies.”
\p
\v 3 Judah answered, “Father, the authority gave us a stern warning to not approach him if we don't bring Benjamin.
\v 4 If Father permits him to go along, then we will leave quickly.
\v 5 If Father doesn't permit him to go along, then we can't go because the authority said clearly that we will not be allowed to approach him without our younger sibling.”
\p
\v 6 Jacob (whom God also named Israel) said, “How could you all make it harder for me by saying to that person that you all have a younger sibling?”
\p
\v 7 They answered “That person asked us carefully about ourselves and our family, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you all have a younger sibling?’ Because of that we answered him. How could we know he would order us to bring Benjamin?”
\p
\v 8 Judah said to their father, “Permit Benjamin to go along. I will be responsible for him. Let us leave quickly, if not we will all die of hunger.
\v 9 I will be sure he remains alive with my own life as a guarantee. If I don't bring him back safely, let me bear the punishment for it as long as I live.
\v 10 Supposing at that time father had allowed us to go, we would certainly have already come back here bringing food supplies.
\p
\v 11 “If that is really so,” their father said, “(Don't go with empty hands), bring as a gift to the governor the best produce of this land that is balsam, honey, almonds, pistachios, spices and myrrh.
\v 12 Be sure you all bring money in hand two times over, don't let it have been a mistake, and the money that was found in your sacks have to be returned.
\v 13 Bring your younger sibling to meet that person and return quickly.
\v 14 May Almighty God have mercy on you all, and you along with Benjamin and Simeon return to us. If I have to lose other children, what can I do?”
\p
\v 15 So, along with Benjamin, they left for Egypt bringing a gift from their land along with money as payment. After they arrived, they approached Joseph.
\p
\v 16 When Joseph saw Benjamin standing before him, he quickly ordered the head manager of the household, “Bring those people to my house. Slaughter and cook an animal because later today they will eat lunch with me.”
\v 17 The head manager of the household did according to what Joseph ordered. He brought them to Joseph's house.
\p
\v 18 They were afraid to be brought to Joseph's house. They said, “This is certainly because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time we came to buy food supplies. Now as a result maybe we will be made slaves and our donkeys will be taken.”
\s1 The dinner with Joseph and his brothers
\p
\v 19 When they arrived at the door of Joseph's house they approaced the head manager of the household and said,
\v 20 “Father, we previously came here to buy food supplies.
\v 21 When we were on our journey home, we opened our sacks and found our money payment. We have brought that money to be returned.
\v 22 We don't know who put that money in our sacks. This time we brought extra money to buy more food supplies.”
\p
\v 23 The head manager of the household said, “Don't worry. Your God— the God your father worships has certainly returned your money. The matter of payment at that time, I have already received.” Then he brought Simeon to them.
\p
\v 24 Then he took them into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and also gave food to their donkeys.
\v 25 Then they prepared the gift items that would be given to Joseph when he came home to eat lunch with them.
\p
\v 26 Joseph came home and they approached him while bowing to surrender their gift.
\v 27 Joseph asked them about their situation and continued to ask, “Is your father well, how is the situation with your parent that you talked about before? Is he still alive?”
\p
\v 28 They answered, “Your servant—our father is still alive and his situation is just fine.”Then they bowed before him.
\p
\v 29 When Joseph saw Benjamin he said, “Is this the younger sibling that you had talked about? May God bless you, my child.”
\v 30 Because he couldn't hold back his feeling of love and longing for his younger sibling, Joseph quickly entered his room and cried.
\v 31 After washing his face, Joseph went out and while controlling his feelings, he ordered so that dinner be served.
\p
\v 32 The servants had prepared a table for Joseph alone, another table for his older and younger siblings and another table for the Egyptians who ate with them. That is because the Egyptian people considered it contemptible if they had to sit at the same table with Hebrew people.
\v 33 Joseph's brothers sat facing him, arranged according to their birth order, beginning with the oldest down to the youngest. When they realized this, they looked at each other in surprise.
\v 34 Their food was served from Joseph's table. Benjamin was served food and drink five times more than his older siblings. Joseph and his brothers ate and drank until satisfied.
