\c 19
\s1 The angel told Lot that Sodom would be destroyed
\p
\v 1 When evening [lit: when afternoon was approaching night] came, the two angels arrived at the city of Sodom. At that moment Lot was sitting at the gate of the city. When he saw them, he rose to greet and salute/honor them and knelt until his face touched the ground.
\v 2 He said to them, “Gentlemen, please stay at my house tonight. You may wash your feet, and tomorrow you can continue the journey again.”
\p But they replied, “No. We'll just spend the night here, in the town square.”
\p
\v 3 But Lot kept asking them insistently to stay in his house. Finally they entered the Lot's house, and Lot prepared food for them. He baked bread without yeast, then they ate it.
\v 4 After eating and before they went to bed, all the men from all parts of the city of Sodom— including the young and the old, came and surrounded Lot's house.
\v 5 They shouted at Lot by saying, “Where are the two men/people who are staying at your house tonight? Bring them out so we can have sex with them!”
\p
\v 6 Then Lot came out of the house and closed the door behind him so they could not go inside.
\v 7 He said to them, “My brothers and sisters, don't do an evil thing like that!
\v 8 Please listen to me! I have two daughters who are still virgins. Let me bring them out to you now, and you can do whatever you want to to them. But don't do anything to these two men, because they are guests at my house, so I have to protect them! "
\p
\v 9 But they answered, “Step aside from there! You're just a new-comer here! Go now! If not, we will do something worse to you than what we want to do to your guests!” Then they rushed towards Lot in order to break down the door.
\p
\v 10 But the two angels opened the door briefly and pulled Lot back into the house, then immediately closed the door again.
\v 11 Next they made everyone standing outside be blind— both old and young, so they couldn't find the door again.
\p
\v 12 Then the two angels said to Lot, “Who else from your family lives in this city? If you have a son, daughter, daughter-in-law or other relatives, bring them out of this city!
\v 13 We are people/men sent by God to destroy this place. Because in His sight, these people have been very evil.”
\p
\v 14 The next morning before dawn, Lot went to see his two prospective sons-in-law and said, “Hurry! Leave this city, because the LORD will quickly destroy it!” But they even thought Lot was joking.
\p
\v 15 When it was almost dawn, the two angels pressed Lot saying, “Hurry up! Bring your wife and your two girls away from here! If not, you will die when we destroy this city!”
\p
\v 16 When Lot still hadn't begun to move, the two angels immediately took his hand and the hand of his wife and his two girls, then brought them out of the city safely. The angels did that because the Lord had pity on them.
\v 17 When they arrived outside the city, one of the angels said, “Run to save your lives! Do not turn to look back! Don't stop in the valley! Run to the hills so you won't die!”
\p
\v 18 But Lot said to one of the angels, “Oh, no, sir!
\v 19 (You) Sir/Master have been very kind to me by saving my life. But the hills are too far away! If I try to do that, I will die before I get there.
\v 20 Ove there there is a village close enough to here. Let us go to that little village so that we'll be safe.”
\p
\v 21 One of the angels said, “Alright, I grant your request. I will not destroy the little village.
\v 22 But hurry up! Run there, because I won't be able to start making punishment fall on these people before you get there.” After the incident the village was named Small Village, because Lot said that the village was small.\f + fr 19:22 \fk Small ... \ft Literally the name of the village in Hebrew is ‘Zoar’ which means ‘small’.\f *
\s1 The Lord destroyed the city of Sodom and the city of Gomorrah
\p
\v 23 Lot and his family arrived in the village which is now called a Small Village when the day had become mid-day.
\v 24 Then the LORD dropped sulfur fire on Sodom and Gomorrah— like rain from the sky.
\v 25 That's how the Lord destroyed those two cities and all those who lived there. He also destroyed everything in the valley, including all kinds of plants.
\v 26 But Lot's wife stopped in the middle of the [way//road] and looked back, and her corpse became a pillar of salt.
