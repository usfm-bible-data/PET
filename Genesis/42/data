\s1 Joseph's Brothers go to Egypt
\p
\v 1 When Jacob got news that in Egypt there was wheat, then he said to his children, “Why don't you do something?”\f + \fr 42:1 Why don't you do something\fk \ft Literally in the Jewish language, “Why do you (just) sit looking at each other?”\f*
\v 2 Jacob continued, “I've heard that in Egypt they are selling wheat. Go there and buy wheat so that we don't die of hunger.”
\v 3 So the ten older brother's of Joseph went to Egypt to buy wheat.
\v 4 Jacob intentionally didn't allow Benjamin— Joseph's younger womb sibling, to follow with his older step siblings, because he said, “Perhaps he would be struck by some accident later.”
\v 5 Then Jacob's ten children left together with other buyers, because at that time the famine had struck the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 6 Joseph in the highest official in Egypt had power to sell food, like wheat to all of the people of Egypt who wanted to buy food. At that time, Joseph's older siblings came and knelt before him.
\v 7 When his older siblings were in front of him, Joseph recognized them, but he acted as if he didn't know them. With a rough tone he asked, “Where do you all come from?”
\p They answered, “We come from Canaan wanting to buy wheat for food.”
\p
\v 8 Joseph recognized his older siblings, but they didn't recognize him anymore.
\v 9 Then Joseph remembered his dream about them.\x + \xo 42:9 Gen\xt . 37:5-10.\x* And he said to them, “You all are spies and intentionally infiltrated our land to find out where are the weaknesses of our land!”
\p
\v 10 They answered, “No our Master! Your servants have come just to buy food supplies.
\v 11 We are all children from the same father. We aren't deceivers or spies!”
\p
\v 12 Joseph said, “No! You all came here definitely to investigate where our land is weak!”
\p
\v 13 They answered back, “We come from the Land of Canaan and have the same father. We are all siblings, twelve people. However, one of us has died and our youngest sibling is with our father.”
\p
\v 14 Joseph said to them, “Like I have already said, you all are spies!
\v 15 In order to test you all, I swear by the name of the king of Egypt that I won't let you go from this place before your youngest brother comes here.
\v 16 Choose one of you that will go home to get your younger sibling and bring him here, while the others will be held in prison, until what you all say is proven true. If its not true that you have a younger sibling, then by the name of the king of Egypt, its certain that you all are spies!”
\p
\v 17-18 Then he put them all in custody. On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Because I am a person who fears and respects God, I will save and free you with one condition.
\v 19 If you all are honest people, then one of you has continue to be held, and the others may bring food supplies back to your families who are hungry.
\v 20 Bring back your youngest sibling to meet me. In that way, you all will prove that you all aren't wrong and I won't take your lives.” They just agreed with it.
\p
\v 21 They said to each other, “We are paying for the wrong to our younger sibling. When we saw his suffering and when he pleaded, we didn't care about it. Everything we are experiencing is as a result.”
\p
\v 22 Reuben said, “At that time I said not to hurt him, but you all didn't pay attention to my words. Now we are receiving the payment for what we did.”
\p
\v 23 They didn't know that Joseph understood what they were saying because up till then they communicated using a translator.
\v 24 Joseph went and left them and cried. After calming, he returned and ordered that Simeon be tied in front of his brothers. Then the others were permitted to return home to Canaan.
\p
\v 25 Joseph had ordered that their sacks be filled with wheat and the wheat money payment be returned in each of their own sacks. Besides that, they also were given food for their journey home.
\v 26 The sacks were tied on their donkeys and they left.
\p
\v 27 When they stopped to rest that night, one of them opened his sack to give food to his donkey and found the wheat money payment in his sack.
\v 28 “My money was returned,” he said, “Look—this, is in the sack!” They became afraid and anxious, then they said to each other, “What is God doing to us?”
\v 29 Getting back to the house, they told all of what happened in Egypt.
\p
\v 30 “The authority in that land spoke roughly and accused that we are spies.
\v 31 We gave the explanation that we are honest people and didn't come to spy that land.
\v 32 We also explained that we are twelve brothers and one of our younger siblings has died and the youngest stayed with Father in Canaan.”
\v 33 Then the authority said that in order to know if we are honest or not, one of us had to stay, and the others could go home bringing wheat to our families.
\v 34 But it was already decided that we must bring our youngest sibling to meet the authority. In that way he would know that we spoke honestly and we would be permitted to buy and sell in Egypt.”
\p
\v 35 Then they all opened their cargo of food supplies that they had brought. After that all was opened and it was found that their money was returned, they and their father were very frightened.
\v 36 Their father Jacob said, “Do you want me to lose all of my children? I have mourned the death of Joseph. Simeon didn't return and now you all would take Benjamin from me?”
\p
\v 37 Reuben answered, “I will be responsible for Benjamin. If he doesn't return, then father may take the lives of my two sons!”
\p
\v 38 Jacob said, “This is my one remaining child and I won't permit him to go. His older sibling is dead and he alone remains. I am old, and I will die because of feeling grief if something happens to him.”
