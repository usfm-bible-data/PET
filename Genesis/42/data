\s1 Joseph's Brothers go to Egypt
\p
\v 1 When Jacob got news that in Egypt there was wheat, then he said to his children, “Why don't you do something?”\f + \fr 42:1 Why don't you do something\fk  \ft Literally in the Jewish language, “Why do you (just) sit looking at each other?”\f*
\v 2 Jacob continued, “I've heard that in Egypt they are selling wheat. Go there and buy what so that we don't die of hunger.”
\v 3 So the ten older brother's of Joseph went to Egypt to buy wheat.
\v 4 Jacob intentionally didn't allow Benjamin— Joseph's younger womb sibling, to follow with his older step sibling, because he said, “Perhaps he would be struck by some accident later.”
\v 5 Then Jacob's ten children left together with other buyers, because at that time the famine had struck the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 6 Joseph in the highest official in Egypt had power to sell food, like wheat to all of the people of Egypt who wanted to buy food. At that time, Joseph's older siblings came and knelt before him.
\v 7 When his older siblings were in front of him, Joseph recognized them, but he acted as if he didn't know them. With a rough tone he asked, “Where do you all come from?”
\p They answered, “We come from Canaan wanting to buy wheat for food.”
\p
\v 8 Joseph recognized his older siblings, but they didn't recognize him anymore.
\v 9 Then Joseph remembered his dream about them.\x + \xo 42:9 Gen\xt . 37:5-10.\x* And he said to them, “You all are spies and intentionally infiltrated our land to find out where are the weaknesses of our land!”
\p
\v 10 They answered, “No our Master! Your servants have come just to buy food supplies.
\v 11 We are all children from the same father. We aren't deceivers or spies!”
\p
\v 12 Joseph said, “No! You all came here definitely to investigate where our land is weak!”
\p
\v 13 They answered back, “We come from the Land of Canaan and have the same father. We are all siblings, twelve people. However, one of us has died and our youngest sibling is with our father.”
\p
\v 14 Joseph said to them, “Like I have already said, you all are spies!
\v 15 In order to test you all, I swear by the name of the king of Egypt that I won't let you go from this place before your youngest brother comes here.
\v 16 Choose one of you that will go home to get your younger sibling and bring him here, while the others will be held in prison, until what you all say is proven true. If its not true that you have a younger sibling, then by the name of the king of Egypt, its certain that you all are spies!”
\p
\v 17 Then he put them all in custody.
\v 18 On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Because I am a person who fears God, I will save and free you with one condition.
\v 19 If you all are honest people, then one of you has to stay, and the others may bring food supplies back to your families who are hungry.
\v 20 Bring back your youngest sibling to meet me. In that way, you all will prove that you all aren't wrong and I won't take your lives.” They just agreed with it.
\p
\v 21They said to each other, “We are paying for the wrong to our younger sibling. When we saw his suffering and when he pleaded, we didn't care about it. Everything we are experiencing is as a result.”
\p
\v 22 Reuben said, “At that time I said not to hurt him, but you all didn't pay attention to my words. Now we are receiving the payment for what we did.”
\p
\v 23 They didn't know that Joseph understood what they were saying because up till then they communicated using a translator.
\v 24 Joseph went and left them and cried. After quieting, he returned and ordered that Simeon be tied in front of his brothers. Then the others were permitted to return home to Canaan.
\p
\v 25 Joseph had ordered that their sacks be filled with wheat and the wheat money payment be returned in each of their own sacks. Besides that, they also were given food for their journey home.
\v 26 The sacks were tied on their donkeys and they left.
\p
\v 27 When they stopped to rest that night, one of them opened his sack to give food to his donkey and found the wheat money payment in his sack.
\v 28 “My money was returned,” he said, “Look—this, is in the sack!” They became afraid and anxious, then they said to each other, “What is God doing to us?”
\v 29 Getting back to the house, they told all of what happened in Egypt.
\p
\v 30 “The authority in that land spoke roughly and accused that we are spies.
\v 31 We gave the explanation that we are honest people and didn't come to spy that land.
\v 32 We also explained that we are twelve brothers and one of our younger siblings has died and the youngest stayed with Father in Canaan.”
\v 33 Lalu penguasa itu berkata bahwa untuk mengetahui apakah kita jujur atau tidak, salah satu dari kami harus tinggal, dan yang lain diperbolehkan pulang membawa gandum untuk keluarga kita.
\v 34 Tetapi sudah diputuskan bahwa kami harus membawa adik yang bungsu untuk menemui sang penguasa. Dengan demikian dia akan tahu bahwa kami berkata jujur dan kita akan diperbolehkan untuk berdagang di Mesir.”
\p
\v 35 Kemudian mereka semua membongkar muatan bahan makanan yang sudah mereka bawa. Setelah semuanya dibuka dan ditemukan bahwa uang mereka sudah dikembalikan, mereka bersama bapak mereka sangat takut.
\v 36 Berkatalah Yakub, bapak mereka, “Apakah kalian ini ingin aku kehilangan semua anak-anakku? Aku sudah meratapi kematian Yusuf, Simeon tidak kembali dan sekarang kalian akan membawa Benyamin dariku?”
\p
\v 37 Ruben menjawab, “Aku akan bertanggung jawab penuh atas Benyamin. Bila dia tidak kembali, maka bapak boleh mengambil nyawa kedua anak laki-lakiku!”
\p
\v 38 Kata Yakub, “Anakku tinggal yang satu ini dan aku tidak mengijinkannya untuk pergi. Kakaknya sudah mati dan hanya tinggal dia. Aku sudah tua, dan aku akan mati karena rasa duka jika terjadi sesuatu terhadapnya.”
