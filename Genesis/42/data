\s1 Joseph's Brothers buy wheat to Egypt
\p
\v 1 When Jacob was told that in Egypt there was a supply of wheat, then he said to his children, “Don't just do nothing!”\f + \fr 42:1 \fk Don't just do nothing! \ft Literally in Hebrew, “Why do you (just) sit looking at each other?!”\f*
\v 2 Jacob continued, “I've heard there is wheat in Egypt. Go there and buy wheat so that we don't die of hunger!”
\v 3 So the ten older brother's of Joseph went to Egypt to buy wheat.
\v 4 Jacob intentionally didn't allow Benjamin, Joseph's younger womb sibling, to follow with his older step siblings saying, “Don't let him be struck by some accident later.”
\v 5 Then Jacob's ten children left together with other buyers, because at that time the famine had struck the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 6 Joseph was the highest official in Egypt, he had authority to sell wheat to all of the people of Egypt. At that time, Joseph's older siblings came and knelt before him.
\v 7 When Joseph saw his older siblings, he recognized them. But he acted as if he didn't know them and talked roughly to them. He asked them, “Where do you(pl) come from?”
\p They answered, “We come from Canaan wanting to buy wheat.”
\p
\v 8 Although Joseph recognized his older siblings, but they didn't recognize him anymore.
\v 9 Joseph remembering his dreams about them,\x + \xo 42:9 Gen\xt . 37:5-10\x* then said, “You all are spies and intentionally infiltrated our land to find out where are the weaknesses of our land!”
\p
\v 10 They answered, “No, Sir! Your servants have come just to buy food.
\v 11 We are all children from one father. We aren't deceivers or spies!”
\p
\v 12 Joseph said, “No! You all certainly came here to investigate where our land is weak!”
\p
\v 13 They answered back, “We come from Canaan and from one father. We are all siblings, twelve sons. However, one of us has died and our youngest sibling is with our father.”
\p
\v 14 But Joseph said to them, “Like I have already said, you all are spies!
\v 15 In order to prove that you(pl) are true/honest, I swear by the name of the king of Egypt that I won't let you go from this place, before your youngest brother comes here.
\v 16 Choose one of you that will go home to get your younger sibling and bring him here, while the others will be held in prison, until what you all say is proven true. If it turns out that you do not have a younger sibling, then by the name of the king of Egypt, its certain that you all are spies!”
\p
\v 17-18 Then he put them all in prison. Two days later\f + \fr 42:18 \fk Two days later \ft Literally, ‘On the third day’. See the footnote at Gen. 22:4.\f* Joseph said to them, “Because I am a person who fears and respects God, I will free you with one condition.
\v 19 If you all are truly honest people, then one of you will continue to be held, and the others may take wheat back to your families who are in the famine.
\v 20 Bring your youngest sibling to meet me. In that way, you all will prove that you can be trusted, so that you will not be put to death.” They just agreed with it.
\p
\v 21 They said to each other, “We are being punished for the wrong to our younger sibling. We saw how he was miserable, and when he pleaded for mercy to us, but we didn't do anything about that. Because of that we are experiencing all of this.”
\p
\v 22 Reuben said, “At that time I said not to hurt that child, but you all didn't pay attention to my words. Now we are receiving the payment for our deed.”
\p
\v 23 They didn't know that Joseph understood what they were saying because up till then they spoke through a translator.
\v 24 Then Joseph went and left them and cried. After he was able to keep control of his feelings, he returned and ordered that Simeon be tied in front of his brothers. Then the others were permitted to return home to Canaan.
\p
\v 25 Joseph gave a command to his servant to fill their sacks with wheat, and to put the wheat payment money in each of their sacks. Joseph also gave them food supplies for their journey home.
\v 26 When the sacks were tied on the backs their donkeys, finally they left.
\p
\v 27 That night, at the place they spent the night, one of them opened his sack to give food to his donkey. When he opened that sack, he found that the payment money was on top of the wheat.
\v 28 Then he said to his brothers, “Look! My money has been returned! This was in the sack!” So they became afraid and anxious, then they said to each other, “What is God doing to us?”
\p
\v 29 Several days later when they arrived home, they told Jacob all of that had happened in Egypt,
\v 30 “The ruler of that land spoke roughly and accused us of being spies.
\v 31 We explained, ‘We are honest people, not spies.
\v 32 We are twelve brothers. One of our younger siblings has died, and the youngest stayed with Father in Canaan.’
\v 33 Then that authority said, ‘Prove that you all are honest men. One of you all has to stay, and the others may go home bringing wheat for your families.
\v 34 Then you all must bring that youngest sibling of yours to me. In that way I will know that you spoke honestly, are not spies. I will free your brother and you will be permitted to trade in Egypt.’”
\p
\v 35 Next, when they all unpacked their cargo of food supplies, then they found that their money had been returned in each of their sacks. So they and Jacob were very frightened.
\v 36 Jacob said, “Do you want me to lose all of my children?! I have mourned the death of Joseph, Simeon didn't return, and now you will take Benjamin from me?! I am the world leader in suffering!”
\p
\v 37 Reuben answered, “I will be fully responsible for Benjamin. I will certainly bring him back. If I don't bring him back, Father may take the lives of my two sons!”
\p
\v 38 But Jacob said, “I won't permit him to go! His older brother is dead, and he alone remains of my sons from Rachel. I am old, and if something happens to him certainly I will quickly enter Sheol\f + \fr 4:38 \fk Sheol \ft See the footnote at 37:35.\f* because of grief.”
