\c 8
\s1 God made the water recede and told Noah to leave the ship
\p
\v 1 But God did not forget Noah and his family and all who were with them on the ship. So God made the wind blow over the surface of the earth, so that the water began to recede.
\v 2 God made the rain stop and all the springs below the surface stopped flowing.
\v 3 The water that had once covered the surface of the earth gradually receded, so that on the hundred and fiftieth day, the water had diminished.
\v 4 On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ship was stuck/stranded on one of the mountains in the Ararat region.
\v 5 On the first day of the tenth month, mountain peaks began to appear because the water continued to recede.
\p
\v 6 Forty days later, Noah opened a window that ofhe had made on the ship
\v 7 and released a crow. The crow did not return to the ship, but continued to fly to and fro until the flood water had completely dried up from the surface of the earth.
\v 8 Because the crow didn't return, Noah released a dove to find out if the water had receded.
\v 9 But the dove couldn't find a place to perch, because the water still filled the entire surface of the earth. Finally the dove returned to the ship. Noah reached out his hand to catch it, and returned it to the ship again.
\v 10 Seven days later, Noah let it go again.
\v 11 Around nightfall, the dove returned to Noah bringing a fresh olive leaf in its beak. From there Noah knew that water had truly receded.
\v 12 Seven days later, Noah released that bird again, but this time the dove did not return to Noah.
\p
\v 13 When Noah was 601 years old— specifically on the first day of the first month, the water had truly/completely receded. Then Noah opened the door in the top part of the ship and saw that the surface of the earth was truly dry.
\v 14 On the twenty-seventh of the next month, the entire surface of the earth was completely dry.
\p
\v 15 Then God said to Noah,
\v 16 “Go out of the boat with your wife, sons and also your daughters-in-law.
\v 17 Free all the species of birds, animals, and reptiles and those that creep and crawl on the ground, so that they can reproduce, multiply, and spread throughout the earth.”
\p
\v 18 Then Noah came out of the boat with his wife, sons and daughters-in-law.
\v 19 And every species of living thing also left the ship in groups— according to their species.
\s1 God promised not to destroy mankind again with a flood
\p
\v 20 Then Noah built an altar of stones as a place to offer sacrifices to the Lord. Then, from every kind of animal and bird that is not (considered) unclean for offering to the LORD, Noah chose and offered one as an offering that completely burned on that altar.
\v 21 When the Lord smelled\f + \fr 8:21 \fk smelled \ft The Bible of course teaches that God is a spirit, but the Bible also often uses figures of speech which are known as anthropomorphisms, so that God is pictured as having eyes to see, ears to hear, etc.\f* the sweet smell of the burnt sacrifice, He was pleased and decided in said,
\q1 “I will no longer curse this earth as a punishment for mankind—
\q2 even though from the time they are small/young, their desires are continually evil.
\q1 I will not destroy all living things again
\q2 like I have done th
\v 22 As long as this earth still exists,
\q2 there will always be planting and harvesting seasons,
\q2 winter and summer seasons,
\q2 dry and rainy season, and
\q2 day and night.”
