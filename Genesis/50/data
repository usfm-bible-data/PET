\s1 Jacob’s corpse is preserved
\p
\v 1 Full of feelings of sorrow, Joseph hugged his father and while crying kissed his face.
\v 2 Then Joseph gave an order to preserve his father's body with perfumes and resin from trees. That command was done by the experts of Egypt who possessed the expertise for preserving corpses.
\v 3 The time needed to do that thing was forty days. The Egyptian people mourned for Jacob for seventy days.
\v 4 After the period of mourning was over, Joseph said to the palace employees, “If you are willing to help me, I ask that this message be conveyed to the king,
\v 5 ‘When my father was dying, according to his request, I made an oath to bury him in the tomb that he had prepared in the land of Canaan. Permit me to bury him there. After that I will return.’”
\p
\v 6 The king answered, “Fulfill your promise to your father. Go and bury your father.”
\v 7 So Joseph went to bury his father. All of the royal officials, elders of the palace, and senior officials also went with Joseph.
\v 8 All the members of Joseph's family, his brothers, along with all of his father's family went together. But the small children and herds of livestock remained in Goshen.
\v 9 Besides that a troop of chariots and horses went along, so that the party became very large.
\p
\v 10 After they arrived at the place of threshing owned by Atad— which was located across the Jordan river— a funeral ceremony began lasting seven days. That ceremony was accompanied by crying and wailing.
\v 11 When the Canaanite people saw the mourning and funeral service, they said, “How great is the feeling of mourning of these Egyptian people!” So since that time that place which was located beyond the Jordan river was named Place Where the Egyptians Mourned.\f + \fr 50:11 \fk Place Where the Egyptians Mourned \ft The aforementioned name in Hebrew is ‘Abel Mizraim’.\f*
\v 12 In that way Jacobs children carried out their father's final wishes.
\v 13 Their father's body was brought and buried in the cave in Machpelah near Mamre, in Canaan. That place is in the field that was bought by Abraham from Ephron the Hittite. Abraham bought it to become the final resting place for their family.
\s1 Joseph's brothers apologize
\p
\v 14 After burying their father, Joseph, his brothers, and the group that went with to accompany the body returned to Egypt.
\v 15 After their father was no longer, his brothers were afraid of Joseph and said, “What if Joseph still holds a grudge against all the evil deeds that we did to him?”
\v 16 Then they made an agreement to send a message to Joseph. The message contained this, “Before father died,
\v 17 he ordered us to ask forgiveness from you for all of the evil deeds that we have ever done to you. Because of that, we request that you be willing to forgive us— who like you, are servants of the God of our father.” Joseph cried when he received the contents of that message.
\v 18 His brothers came and knelt with their faces to the ground before Joseph while saying, “We are your servants.”
\p
\v 19 Joseph replied to them, “Don't be afraid! I don't have the right to judge you(pl) because I'm not God.
\v 20 Initially you(pl) of course planned an evil thing against me, but truly God had a good plan in that situation, so that many people would be saved, as has already happened.
\v 21 There is nothing for you to be afraid of. I will meet all of you and your children's needs.” In that way Joseph put their hearts at peace.
\s1 Death of Joseph
\p
\v 22 Joseph and his brothers together with their families stayed in Egypt. Joseph died at the age of 110 years old.
\v 23 Before he died, Joseph had the opportunity to see Ephraim's children and grandchildren, and also his great grandchildren from Machir, Manasseh's child. They were adopted by Joseph as his children and received inheritance from him.
\p
\v 24 Joseph said to his brothers, “My death is near, but God will be with you all and guide you all out of Egypt to return to the land that He promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
\p
\v 25 So I ask you(pl) to swear: When God takes you out of Egypt to return to Canaan, you must take my bones to be buried there.”
\v 26 Joseph died in Egypt at the age of 110 years, then they preserved his body with special balsam and spices. Then his body was put in a chest.
