\s1 The LORD punished Cain because he killed his younger brother Abel
\p
\v 1 Adam became one body with Eve, his wife. Eve became pregnant, and then birthed a male child. At the time of his birth Eve said, "The LORD has helped me to get a male child." So the child was given the name Cain. \f + 
\fr4:1 \fk Cain \ft the pronunciation of the name Cain is almost the same as several words in the Hebrew language— that mean 'get', 'obtain' or 'create'. \f*
\v 2 Sometime later Eve birthed another male child, who was given the name Abel. \f + 
\fr4:1 \fk Habel \ft The name Abel is almost the same as the word that means 'breath' or 'vapor'.\f*
\p After the two children grew to adulthood, Cain became a farmer, whereas Abel chose to become a shepherd of goats and sheep.
\v 3 One day Cain harvested the produce of his garden to be given to the LORD as an offering.
\v 4 Whereas Abel took one of the sheep that was firstborn from his flock, slaughtered it, then offered it to the LORD the best part of his sheep—which was the fat. The LORD was pleased with Abel and his offering,
\v 5 but not so with Cain and his offering. Because of that Cain's heart was hot, and his face looked furious.
\v 6 The LORD said to Cain, "Why do you have to be mad? Why do you look furious?"
\v 7 If you do what is right, your face will certainly be cloudless because I will receive your offering. But if you keep doing what isn't right, sin wants to control you like a wild animal that is ready to devour. You have to be able to defeat it."
\v 8 However one day, Cain invited his younger brother, "Abel, let's go to the field." And they just went together. When they arrived in the field, suddenly Cain attacked and killed Abel.
\v 9 Although the LORD knew what Cain had done, the LORD asked, "Cain, where is your younger brother Abel?"
\p Cain answered, "I don't know. Do you think I'm my younger brother's guard?"
\p
\v 10 The LORD said, "You've sinned greatly! Your younger brother's blood that has soaked into the ground, in My eyes is like a person crying to ask for revenge.
\v 11 You've killed your own younger brother and the ground has oozed out his blood. For that I chase you from this ground and curse all of your labors in working the ground.
\v 12 Before now this ground was very fertile. But from now on, when you work and plan, this ground will not produce like it used to. For that reason, you will be forced to move around."
\p
\v 13 Cain answered the LORD, "The punishment You gave me is very heavy! I'm not able to bear it.
\v 14 You drove me away from this land, and distanced me from before You. I'm forced to live moving around, and anyone can kill me!"
\p
\v 15 But the LORD said to him, "No. That won't happen. I will give a sign on your forehead so that people will know that you can't be killed. When you are killed, then seven people have to be killed as retribution for your murder." Then the LORD gave a sign on Cain's forehead.
\v 16 Lalu Cain went from before God to live in the land that was called Nod— which means ' to wander', that was situated to the west side of the garden of Eden.
\s1 List of Cain's descendants
\p
\v 17 Some time later, Cain and his wife got \f + \fr 4:17 \fk got \ft Like 4:1 literally this verse writes "Cain knew his wife, and she (his wife) became pregnant..." The word 'knew' is an analogy (polite language) for becoming one body. Here and in 4:25, the TSI makes the word 'knew' implicit because the purpose is considered to be understood. \f* a male child who was given the name Enoch. At that time, Cain was building a city, and he gave that city the name 'Enoch'— the same as his child.
\v 18 Enoch became the father of Irad. Then Irad became the father of Methushael. And Methushael became the father of Lamek.
\v 19 Lamech married two women—who were Adah and Zillah.
\v 20-21 Adah birthed two male children who were named Jabal and Jubal. Jabal was the first person who became a raiser of livestock. Because groups of lifestock need to move from place to place, so Jabal became the first person who always lived in a tent. Whereas his younger brother was the first person who made the musical instruments of harps and flutes.
\v 22 Zillah also birthed a male child who was given the name Tubal-Cain. He was the first person to become a forger of iron. Tubal-Cain had a younger sister who was named Naama.
\p
\v 23 One day Lamech said to his two wives,
\q1 "Adah and Zillah, listen to me!
\q2 I defended myself from a young man who attacked me.
\q1 He definitely wounded me,
\q2 but it was I who killed him.
\q1
\v 24 Retribution if Cain is killed
\q2 seven people have to be killed.
\q1 When I am killed
\q2 then 77 people have to be killed!"
\s1 Adam and Eve have another male child named Seth
\p
\v 25 Then Adam and Eve got another male child. Eve gave the child the name Seth, which means, 'gift', because Eve said, "The LOARD gave me another child as replacement for Abel who was killed by Cain."
\v 26 Seth became the father of Enosh. At that time people began to worship the LORD.
