\s1 The LORD punished Cain because he killed his younger brother Abel
\p
\v 1 Adam and Eve lived together as husband and wife.\f + \fr 4:1 \fk lived together as husband and wife \ft Here and in verses 17 and 25, literally the Hebrew text says that the husband ‘knew his wife, and she became pregnant’. The word translated as ‘know’ is considered a fulfillment of Gen. 2:24, where it was said that the husband would ‘become one with his wife’. In this verse, 17, and 25, the TSI makes the word ‘knew’ implicit, because the sexual meaning is considered to be understood by today's readers.\f* So Eve became pregnant and give birth to a male child. At the time the child was born, Eve said, “The LORD has helped me to get a male child.” So that child was named Cain.\f + \fr 4:1 \fk Cain \ft The pronunciation of the name Cain is almost the same as several words in the Hebrew language that mean 'get', 'obtain' or 'create'.\f*
\v 2 Sometime later Eve birthed another male child, who was given the name Abel. \f +\fr 4:2 \fk Habel \ft The name Abel is almost the same as the word that means 'breath' or 'vapor'.\f*
\p After the two children grew to adulthood, Cain became a farmer, whereas Abel chose to become a shepherd of goats and sheep.
\v 3 One day Cain harvested the produce of his garden, and part of the harvest was offered by him to the LORD.
\v 4 Abel also took several sheep that were firstborn from his flock, slaughtered it, then offered the best parts of the lamb meat to the LORD. And the LORD was pleased with Abel and his offering.
\v 5 But that was not so with Cain and his offering. Because of that Cain's heart was hot, and his face looked furious.
\v 6 So the LORD said to Cain, “It's no use being mad! You don't need to look red/furious.”
\v 7 If you do what is right, certainly I will receive your offerings. But if you keep doing what isn't right, the power of sin— which is like a wild animal— is ready to pounce and rule you. You have to be able to defeat it.”
\p
\v 8 However one day, Cain said to his younger brother, “Abel, let's go to the field.”\f + \fr 4:8 \fk Cain’s quote \ft This quote is not found in the Masoretic Text (the Hebrew source text), but it is found in most of the ancient translations that were done before the MT was organized, including the Septuagint.\f* ( When they arrived in the field, suddenly Cain attacked and killed Abel.
\v 9 Afterwards the LORD asked Cain, “Where is your younger brother, Abel?”\f + \fr 4:9 \fk Where is … \ft Compare with the Gen. 3:9 and see the footnote for that verse.\f*
\p Cain answered, “I don't know. I'm not his guard/watchman.”
\p
\v 10 The LORD said, “You've sinned greatly! Your younger brother's blood that has soaked into the ground, in My eyes is like a person crying to ask for revenge.
\v 11 Because you have killed your own younger brother, I am expelling you from this ground— that is the ground that has soaked up the blood of your younger brother. And as a curse for you, may the ground of this world not any longer give good harvests for you, even though you labor hard in working it.
\v 12 Before now this ground was very fertile. But from now on, when you till and plant, the ground will not any longer give good harvest for you. For that reason, you will be forced to move around.”
\p
\v 13 Cain answered the LORD, “The punishment You gave me is very heavy! I'm not able to bear it.
\v 14 You are driving me away from this land and distancing me from before You. I am/will be forced to live moving around, and anyone can kill me!”
\p
\v 15 But the LORD said to him, “No. That won't happen. I will give a sign on your forehead\f + \fr 4:15 \fk on your forehead \ft The Hebrew text does not say where Cain’s body was marked. But in two other (Bible) books, marks that were given by the LORD on people were always (made) on the forehead. See Ezek. 9:4-5 and the book of Revelation.\f* so that people will know that you can't be killed. If you are killed, then seven people have to be killed as retribution for your murder.” Then the LORD gave a sign on Cain's forehead.
\v 16 Lalu Cain went from before God to live in the land that was called Nod,\f + \fr 4:16 \fk Nod \ft The name Nod means ‘wandering’.\f* that was situated to the east side of the garden of Eden.
\s1 List of Cain's descendants
\p
\v 17 When Cain was building a city, his wife gave birth\f + \fr 4:17 \fk his wife gave birth \ft Because of information found in Gen. 5:3-5, it is likely that Cain's wife was his own sister. But there is another possibility. Because all people at that time could live for hundreds of years, then it could be that Cain married the daughter of his younger brother. About the words ‘gave birth’, see the footnote at Gen. 4:1.\f* to a male child who was given the name Enoch. So that city was named 'Enoch' by him, like the name of his child.
\v 18 Enoch became the father of Irad. Then Irad became the father of Methusha'el. And Methusha'el became the father of Lamek.
\v 19 Lamech married two women, who were Adah and Zillah.
\v 20-21 Adah birthed two male children who were named Jabal and Jubal. Jabal was the forefather of the race/nation who became raisers of livestock. Because groups of lifestock need to move from place to place, so Jabal became the first person who always lived in tents. Whereas Yubal (his younger brother) was the first person who made the musical instruments of harps and flutes.
\v 22 Zillah also birthed a male child who was given the name Tubal-Cain. He was the first person to become a forger of copper and iron. Tubal-Cain had a younger sister who was named Na'ama.
\p
\v 23 One day Lamech said to his two wives,
\q1 “Adah and Zillah, listen to me!
\q2 I defended myself from a young man who attacked me.
\q1 He wounded me,
\q2 because of that I killed him.
\q1
\v 24 Recalling the retribution if Cain is killed—
\q2 which is seven people that must be killed—
\q1 so if I am killed,
\q2 77 people must be killed!”
\s1 The birth of Seth
\p
\v 25 Then Eve became pregnant and gave birth to another male child. Eve gave the child the name Seth,\f + \fr 4:25 \fk Seth \ft The name Seth means, ‘(has) given’.\f* because Eve said, “The LORD gave me another child as replacement for Abel, who was killed by Cain.”
\v 26 Seth became the father of Enosh. At that time people began to worship the LORD.
