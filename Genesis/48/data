\c 48
\s1 Jacob blesses Ephraim and Manasseh
\p
\v 1 Time passed, Joseph got the news that his father's condition had increasingly weakened. Joseph brought his two children Manasseh and Ephraim with him to meet with Jacob.
\v 2 When Jacob was told that Joseph's children had come to visit him, then he gathered his energy to sit in his bed.
\p
\v 3 Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty came to me in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me.
\v 4 He said to me, I will give you many descendants and your descendants will increase and become a large people group. I will give this land to your descendants forever to become their possession.
\v 5 Your two children that were born in Egypt, before Father (I) came Father (I )also considers to be my own children, just like Reuben and Simeon.
\v 6 If you have other descendants, then those children will be your own and their inheritance will be recorded under their older siblings.
\v 7 And for me, when I was on my journey from Padan, North Syria, I was bereaved with Rachel's death in Canaan, not far from Ephrata, then I buried her on the journey to Ephrata. (Now it is known as Bethlehem.)”
\p
\v 8 When Israel saw Joseph's two children, he asked, “Who are these children?”
\p
\v 9 Joseph answered his father, “These are my children that God has given to me in Egypt.”
\p Then his father said, “Bring them to me to be blessed.”
\p
\v 10 Jacob's vision was dim because of his advanced age. So Joseph brought his two children close to Jacob, and Jacob kissed and hugged them.
\v 11 Israel (that is Jacob) said to Joseph, “I didn't imagine I would see your face again. God [also] has allowed me to meet your children also.”
\p
\v 12 Joseph then released his children from Jacob's lap. Then he knelt in front of his father and bowed down.
\v 13 Joseph brought his two children, with his right hand he held Ephraim's hand in position before Jacob's left side, and with his left hand, he held Manasseh's hand which was in front of Jacob's right side.
\v 14 But Jacob whose name was also Israel with his right hand touched Ephraim's head, the youngest child who was at his left side and with his left hand, he touched Manasseh's head, the firstborn child who was at his right side.
\p
\v 15 Then he blessed Joseph and said,
\q1 “May God who was worshiped by my forefathers, Abraham and Isaac—
\q2 God who has become shepherd for my whole life up to this moment,
\q1
\v 16 through His angel who protected me from all evil bless these children.
\q1 May it be through these children, my name and the names of our forefathers— Abraham and Isaac—
\q2 be continued and their descendants fill the whole earth.
\p
\v 17 When Joseph saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim's head, he wasn't happy, then Joseph moved his father's right hand from Ephraim's head and placed it on top of Manasseh's head.
\v 18 “Not like that, father,” said Joseph to Jacob. "Father didn't place your right hand on the head of my firstborn child.”
\p
\v 19 Jacob rejected and said, “I know, Joseph, I know. Manasseh's descendants will become a great people group. Even so, Ephraim will become a greater people group, and the number of his descendants will become many people groups.”
\v 20 On that day, Jacob blessed them and said, “Starting now all of Israel will use the names of you all when they express blessing by saying, ‘May God bless you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ” In that way, Jacob who other name was Israel, placed Ephraim before Manasseh.
\p
\v 21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Not long now, I will die, but God will be with you and will accompany you to guide you to the land of your forefathers.
\v 22 Besides that, I give to you and not to your brothers, a mountain that I took from the Amorites (when warring against them) using my sword and bow.”
