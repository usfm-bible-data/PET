\c 48
\s1 Jacob blesses Ephraim and Manasseh
\p
\v 1 After some time, someone told Joseph in the city that his father's condition was increasingly weakening. So Joseph brought his two children, Manasseh and Ephraim, to visit Jacob.
\v 2 When Jacob was told that Joseph had come, he gathered his energy to sit in his bed.
\p
\v 3 Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty came to me in Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me.
\v 4 He said to me, I will give you many descendants. They will increase and become a large nation. I will give this land to your descendants to become their possession forever.
\v 5 Your two children that were born in Egypt before I/father came to you, I consider them to be my own children, just like Reuben and Simeon.
\v 6 If you have other descendants, then those children will be your own and their inheritance will be recorded under their older siblings.
\v 7 And for me, when I was on my journey from Padan Aram,\x +\xo 48:7 \xt Gen. 35:19-20\x* I was bereaved with Rachel's death in Canaan, not far from Ephrata, then I buried her on the journey to Ephrata.” (That city is now known as Bethlehem.)
\p
\v 8 When Jacob saw Joseph's two children, he asked, “Who are these children?”
\p
\v 9 Joseph answered his father, “These are my children that God has given to me in Egypt.”
\p Then his father said, “Bring them to me to be blessed.”
\p
\v 10 Jacob's vision was dim because of his age was very advanced. So Joseph brought his two children close to Jacob, and Jacob kissed and hugged them.
\v 11 Jacob said to Joseph, “I didn't imagine I would see your face again. But now God has allowed me to meet your children also!”
\p
\v 12 Then Joseph then released his children from Jacob's lap. He knelt before of his father with his face to the ground.
\v 13 Joseph arranged the position of his two children before Jacob. With his right hand, Joseph placed Ephraim so that he was facing Jacob's left side, and with his left hand, he placed Manasseh so that he was facing in front of Jacob's right side.
\v 14 But Jacob with his right hand touched Ephraim's head, the youngest child who was at his left side. And with his left hand, he touched Manasseh's head, the firstborn child who was at his right side.
\p
\v 15 Then he blessed the descendants of Joseph saying,
\q1 “May God who was worshiped by my forefathers, Abraham and Isaac,
\q2 that is the God who has shepherded me every day for all my life
\q2
\v 16 and through His angel has protected me from all evil,
\q2 may He bless these children.
\q1 Let it be through these children, that my name and the names of our forefathers, Abraham and Isaac, be continued,
\q2 and their descendants fill the whole earth.”
\p
\v 17 When Joseph saw that his father placed (his) right hand on Ephraim's head, he didn’t agree (with that). So Joseph took hold of his father's right hand wanting to move it from Ephraim's head and place it on Manasseh's head.
\v 18 “Not like that, Father,” said Joseph to Jacob. “Place your right hand on the head of my firstborn child.”
\p
\v 19 But Jacob rejected and said, “I know, Joseph, I know. Manasseh's descendants will become a great nation. Even so, Ephraim will become a greater people group, and the number of his descendants will become many nations.”
\v 20 On that day Jacob blessed them, “Starting now all the people of Israel will use your names when they bless someone by saying, ‘May God bless you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” In that way, Jacob placed Ephraim before Manasseh.
\p
\v 21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Not long now, I will die, but God will be with you and will be with you to guide you back to the land of your forefathers.
\v 22 Besides that, I give to you and not to your brothers, the hill country that I took from the Amorites when warring against them using my sword and bow.”
