\s1 Palace Workers Dreams
\p
\v 1 At one time, the drink expert and the bread expert of the palace made mistakes in the view of/toward the king of Egypt.\f + \fr 40:1 king of Egypt\ft In this verses, the Hebrew text writes ’the king of Egypt’. whereas in 40:2 it writes ‘pharoh’. Pharoh is not his name, but the word in Egyptian which means ‘king’.\f*
\v 2 So the king was very angry with both of those palace workers,
\v 3 and ordered that they be imprisoned in the prison where Joseph was held— that is the place of the commander of the troop of the king's guards.
\v 4 The commander of the guard troops gave Joseph the task arranging for the needs of those two detainees. They were detained for quite awhile.
\p
\v 5 One night those two prisoner dreamed. Their dreams werent the same and had its own meaning.
\v 6 The net day, when Joseph met those two palace workers, they looked very troubled at heart.
\v 7 Then Joseph asked those two palace workers, “Why do you both look troubled at heart? What is it?”
\p
\v 8 They answered, “Last night we dreamed but there is no one who can give the meaning of our dreams.”
\p Joseph replied, “Only God knows the meaning of dreams. Tell me, and with the LORD's help I will explain the meaning.”
\p
\v 9 The chief drink expert then told his dream to Joseph, “In my dream I saw their was a grape plant near me.
\v 10 The grape plant had three branches. Then the three branches sprouted, then flowered, and then got fruit.
\v 11 At that time I was holding the king's drinking glass, then I picked and squeezed grapes into that king's glass.”
\p
\v 12 Then Joseph answered, “This is the meaning of that dream: the three branches mean three days.
\v 13 In three days time, the king will free you and return you to your responsibility as before— that is to serve drinks to the king.
\v 14 However when you are free and your whole situation is already good, don't forget me. Help me so that I can go out of this prison house. Show your kindness to me by telling the king about me:
\v 15 I was kidnapped and brought by force from the land of the Hebrews. Here I am imprisoned for something I truly didn't do. So I don't deserve to be in prison.”
\p
\v 16 When the expert bread maker saw that the dream of the drink expert had a good meaning, he also asked Joseph to interpret his dream. He said to Joseph, “I also dreamed. In that dream, there were three baskets of bread on my head.
\v 17 The very top basked was full of various kinds of foot— types of bread, for the king. But the birds were eating the food from tht basked that was on top of my head.”
\p
\v 18 Then Joseph answered, “The meaning of the three baskets is three days.
\v 19 In three more days time, the king will release you from prison. However the king will give orders to cut off your head and hang your body from a pole. And birds will eat your flesh.”
\v 20 Three days passed, the king's birthday arrived. He held a feast and invited all of his officials. At that feast, the king released the two workers that were in prison.\f + \fr 40:20 \fk released \ft Literally ‘lifted up’. The writer (Moses) purposely used the word ‘lifted up’ to emphasis two meanings— that is 1) lift up a person to a position, and 2) lift up and hang a person as a death sentence.\f*
\v 21 According to Joseph's prophesy, the king released and returned the responsibility to the drink expert to serve the wine glass to the king.
\v 22 But the bread expert received the death sentence. Everything happened as Joseph had said.
\v 23 However, the drink expert didn't remember Joseph— in face he forgot him.
