\s1 Palace Worker's Dreams
\p
\v 1 At one time, the head drink maker and the the head bread maker of the palace made mistakes in the view of/toward the king of Egypt.\f + \fr 40:1 king of Egypt\ft In this verse, the Hebrew text writes ’the king of Egypt’. whereas in 40:2 it writes ‘pharaoh’. [In Egyptian, the word ‘Pharaoh’ means ‘king’//Pharaoh is not his name, but the word in Egyptian which means ‘king’]. The TSI translates ‘pharaoh’ as ‘king’.\f*
\v 2 So the king was very angry with both of those palace workers,
\v 3 and ordered that they be put in the place that is guarded by the commander of the king's guards, the place where Joseph was held.
\v 4 The commander of the guard troops gave Joseph the task arranging for the needs of those two prisoners. They were imprisoned for a long time.
\p
\v 5 One night those two prisoner dreamed. Their dreams weren't the same and had their own meaning.
\v 6 The next day, when Joseph met those two palace workers, they looked very troubled at heart.
\v 7 Then Joseph asked them, “Why today do you both look troubled at heart. What is it?”
\p
\v 8 They answered, “Last night we dreamed but there is no one who can give the meaning of our dreams.”
\p Joseph replied, “Only God knows the meaning of dreams. Tell me, and with His help I will explain the meaning.”
\p
\v 9 Then the head drink maker told his dream to Joseph, “In that dream I saw their was a grape plant near me.
\v 10 The grape plant had three branches. Then the three branches sprouted, then flowered, and then got fruit.
\v 11 At that time I was holding the king's drinking glass. I picked a few grapes and squeezed them into that glass, then I served it to the king.”
\p
\v 12 Then Joseph answered, “This is the meaning of your dream: the three branches mean three days.
\v 13 In three days time, the king will free you and return you to your previous position— you will serve drinks to the king.
\v 14 However when you are free and your whole situation is already good, don't forget me. Help me so that I can go out of this prison. Show your kindness to me by telling the king about me.
\v 15 I was kidnapped and brought by force from the land of the Hebrews. Here I am imprisoned for something I truly didn't do.”
\p
\v 16 When the head bread maker saw that the dream of the head drink maker had a good meaning, he also said to Joseph, “I also dreamed. In my dream, there were three baskets of bread on my head.
\v 17 In the very top basket, was various kinds of bread for the king. But birds came and were eating it from that basket that was on top of my head.”
\p
\v 18 Then Joseph answered, “Three baskets means three days.
\v 19 In three more days time, the king will release you from prison. However the king will give orders that your head will be cut off and your body will be hung from a pole. And birds will eat your flesh.”
\v 20 Three days later was the king's birthday. He held a feast and invited all of his officials. At the aforementioned feast, the king released\f + \fr 40:20 \fk released \ft Literally ‘lifted up’. The writer purposely used the word ‘lifted up’ to emphasise two meanings, that is 1) lift up a person to a position, and 2) lift up the head of a person as a death sentence.\f* the two workers from prison.
\v 21 The king returned the positionof the head drink maker to serve the wine glass to the king,
\v 22 But the head bread maker was punished with death. Everything happened as was said by Joseph.
\v 23 However, the head drink maker didn't remember Joseph, in fact he forgot him.
