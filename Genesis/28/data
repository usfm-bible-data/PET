\c 28
\p
\v 1 Then Isak called Jacob and blessed him. After that he said to him, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman.
\v 2 Go right away to your grandfather's house Betuel at Padan Aram, and marry one of your uncle Laban's daughters.
\v 3 May God Almighty bless you and give you many offspring, so that one day you will become the ancestor of many nations.
\v 4 May the LORD bless you and all your descendants, according to the blessings He has given Abraham, so that you will have the land that the LORD promised Abraham,\x + \xo 28:4 \xt Kej. 17:8\x* which is the land where we now live as new-comers/foreigners.”
\p
\v 5 With those words Isaac released Jacob go to Padam Aram, to the house of his uncle Laban, the brother of Rebekah. (Laban is the son of Bethuel, the Aramean. Rebekah is the one mentioned as the mother of Jacob and Esau.)
\p
\v 6 Esau learned that his father had blessed Jacob and told him to Padan Aram to find a wife there. He also heard that his father had forbidden Jacob to marry a Canaanite woman,
\v 7 and also that Jacob obeyed their orders, and went to Padan Aram.
\v 8 So Esau realized that his father really did not like Canaanite women.
\v 9 So Esau went to Ishmael — Abraham's son from Hagar— and married his daughter Mahalat. Thus Esau had a new wife besides his other wives. Mahalat is Nebayot's younger sister.
\s Jacob dreamed at Bethel
\p
\v 10 Jacob left Berseba and went to Haran.
\v 11 Because the sun was setting, Jacob decided to spend the night somewhere. Then he took a large stone to use as a pillow for his head so that he could sleep.
\v 12 When he fell asleep, he dreamed of a ladder/stairs. The bottom of the stairs rested on the earth and the end reached to the sky. God's angels were going up and down on the previously mentioned ladder/stairs.
\p
\v 13 Then the Lord stood on the ground beside Jacob and said, “I am the LORD, the God of your grandfather Abraham, and the God of your father Isaac. The land where you are sleeping I will give to you and to all your descendants.
\v 14 The number of your descendants will be like dust on the surface of the earth, and they will spread from east to west, and from north to south. All ethnic groups will be blessed through you and your descendants.
\v 15 I am with you, and will guard you wherever you go, and I will [0//always] lead you back to this land. I will not leave you until I keep my promise.”
\p
\v 16 Then Jacob woke up from his sleep and said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I didn't know it.”
\v 17 Then he got scared and said, “This place is very amazing! This must be the house of God, and this place is the entrance to heaven!”
\p
\v 18 So in the (next) morning he arose and set up the stone to be used by him as a memorial stone. He poured oil on the stone to indicate that the stone was set apart for the LORD.
\v 19 He named the place Bethel,\f + \fr 28:19 \fk Bethel \ft In Hebrew, Bethel means ‘house of God’. See verse 17.\f* (whereas the village nearby was previously named Lus).
\p
\v 20 Then Jacob promised and said, “If God accompanies me and guards me on this journey I was taking, and provides food for me to eat and clothes for me to wear,
\v 21 so that I can return safely to my father's house, then the LORD will become my God.
\v 22 The stone which I have stood up as a reminder will be a place to worship You. And I will give you a tenth of everything that you have given me.”
