\c 28
\p
\v 1 Then Isak called Jacob and blessed him. After that he said to him, "You cannot marry a Canaanite woman.
\v 2 Go immediately to your grandfather's house Betuel at Padan Aram, and marry one of your uncle's daughters Laban.
\v 3 Let God Almighty bless you and give you many offspring, so that one day you will become a great nation.
\v 4 May the LORD bless you and all your descendants - according to the blessings He has given Abraham, so that you will have the land that the LORD promised Abraham."
\p
\v 5 So Isaac let Jacob go to Padam Aram, to the house of his uncle Laban, brother of Rebekah.
\p v 6 Esau learned that his father had blessed Jacob and told him to Padan Aram to find a wife there. He had also heard that his father and mother had forbidden Jacob to marry a Canaanite woman.
\v 7 And also, that Jacob obeyed their orders, and went to Padan Aram.
\v 8 So Esau realized that his father did not really like Canaanite women.
\v 9 So Esau went to Ishmael â€” Abraham's son from Hagar, and married his son, Mahalat. Thus Esau had a new wife besides his other wives. Mahalat is Nebayot's sister.
\Jacob dreamed at Bethel
\p
\v 10 Jacob left Berseba and went to Haran.
\v 11 Because the sun was setting, Jacob decided to spend the night somewhere. Then he took a large stone to make a head pillow so he could sleep.
\v 12 When he fell asleep, he dreamed of a ladder. The bottom of the stairs rests on the earth and the ends reach the sky. God's angels walked down the stairs.
\p
\v 13 Then the Lord stood on the ground beside Jacob and said, "I am the Lord, the God of your grandfather Abraham, and the God of your father Isaac. I will give the land where you are sleeping and to all your descendants.
\v 14 The number of your descendants will be like dust on the surface of the earth, and they will spread from east to west, and from north to south. All ethnic groups will be blessed through you and your descendants.
\v 15 I am with you, and will guard you wherever you go, and I will always lead you back to this land. I will not leave you until I keep my promise."
\p
\v 16 Then Jacob woke up from his sleep and said,"Surely the LORD is in this place and I don't know it."
\v 17 Then he got scared and said, "This place is amazing! This must be the house of God, and this place is the entrance to heaven!"
\p
\v 18 So the next morning he wakes up and sets up the stone he uses as a memorial stone. He poured oil on the stone to indicate that the stone was dedicated to the Lord.
\v 19 He named the place Bethel, \f + fr 28: 19 \f Bethel 
\ft. In Hebrew, Bethel means"house of God". See verse 17. \f * (whereas the name of the place was Lus first).
\p
\v 20 Then Jacob promised and said,"If God accompanied and guarded me on this journey I was taking, and provided food for me to eat and clothes for me to wear,
\v 21 so that I can return to my father's house safely, then the Lord will become my God.
\v 22 The stone which I have established as a warning will be a place to worship You. And I will give you a tenth of everything that you have given me."
