\c 34
\s1 Paying back the grudge against Shechem
\p
\v 1 One day Dinah— the daughter that Leah bore for Jacob, went out to meet the women in that area.
\v 2 But when Shechem (son of Hamor— the head of the Hivite tribe) saw Dinah, he forced that young woman to be with him and raped her.
\v 3 But Shechem became attracted and fell in love with Dinah. Because of that he tried to win Dinah's heart.
\v 4 Then Shechem said to his father, “Father, I want to marry this young woman, I request Father to take her for me!”
\p
\v 5 So the news came to Jacob that Shechem had molested Dinah. However at that time all of his sons were herding his flocks in the field. Because of that Jacob didn't take any action at all. He waited until his sons came home.
\v 6 Meanwhile Hamor (Shechem's father) went to meet Jacob to talk with him.
\v 7 But now all of Jacob's sons had come home from the field because they had heard what happened. They were very angry with what Shechem had done that shamed Israel by violating their sister.
\p
\v 8 Then Hamor said to all of them, “Shechem— may child, really likes Dinah— your(pl) daughter. For that reason I ask your approval so that he can marry your(pl) daughter.
\v 9 You can marry our daughters and allow us to marry your daughters.
\v 10 You may live with us and the land is open to you. Stay and move on here. You may possess land here.
\p
\v 11Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, “I ask that you be generous and fulfill my request and whatever you ask, I will give it.
\v 12 Whatever you ask as bride price I will fulfill, but I beg, give your daughter to me as wife.”
\p
\v 13 Because Shechem had already violated Dinah— their sister, then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father Hamor craftily.
\v 14 They answered, “We can't give our younger sibling to a man who is not yet circumcised because a thing like that would shame us.
\v 15 We can agree with it with the requirement that you become like us, by way of all male relatives getting circumcised.
\v 16 If you do that, then we are ready to give our daughters to you to marry, and take your daughters as wives, and we will remain among you and become one people group.
\v 17 However, if you don't agree with our requirement, then we will bring our younger sibling away.
\p
\v 18 Hamor and his child, Shechem felt happy with the requirement that was delivered.
\v 19 Shechem didn't wait longer and did what fulfilled their request because he really wanted Dinah, Jacob's child.
\v 20 So Hamor and his child, Shechem went to their city gate and spoke with all of the men of their city and said,
\v 21 “These people don't have a dispute with us; let them stay here and trade, because in reality, this land is broad enough to accomodate them. We will marry their women, and vice versa they can marry our women.
\v 22 However, there is one requirement that they want us to fulfill to become one with us as one people group. They insist every male among us has to be circumcised just like they've been circumcised.
\v 23 If we do that, certainly their animal flocks, possessions and all of their other animals will become our possessions. So lets fulfill their request so that we can live together.”
\p
\v 24 All of the men who had gathered at the city gate agreed with what was said by Hamor and his child Shechem. Every male that had gathered there was circumcised.
\v 25 On the third day, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob's children named Simeon and Levi who were older 'womb' siblings of Dinah, took their swords and [secretly attacked all of the men in the city//went to the city [??//boldly]]. Without the awareness of the citizens of that city, they anihilated every male [that was in that city.]
\v 26 They also anihilated Hamor and his child Shechem, and brought Dinah home from Shechem's house.
\v 27 After that massacre, Jacob's other sons looted the city as pay back because their sister had been violated.
\v 28 They took all of the sheep and ox herds, with donkeys, everything that was in the city and even in the fields around it.
\v 29 They took all of the wealth, captured the small children, women and all of the possessions in the houses.
\p
\v 30 Jacob said to Simeon and Lewi, “You've already brought disaster upon us. People of Canaan and Perez together with all other citizens in these lands will think I have done a disgusting thing. They will unite to attack me, whereas I and the amount of my family are small so I and my family will be anihilated.”
\p
\v 31 However Simeon and Levi answered, “Is it proper that he treated our younger sibling like a prostitute?”
