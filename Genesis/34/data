\s1 Paying back the grudge against Shechem
\p
\v 1 One day Dinah the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to meet the women in that area.
\v 2 But someone named Shechem saw Dinah and forced that young woman to be with him and raped her. Shechem was the son of Hamor, the head of the Hivite tribe.
\v 3 But Shechem became attracted and fell in love with Dinah. Because of that he tried to woo Dinah to get her heart.
\v 4 Then Shechem said to his father, “Father, I want to marry this young woman, I request Father to take her for me!”
\p
\v 5 When Jacob heard the news that Shechem had molested Dinah, all of his sons were herding his flocks in the field. Because of that Jacob didn't take any action at all. He waited until his sons came home.
\v 6 Meanwhile Hamor, Shechem's father, went to meet Jacob to talk with him.
\v 7 But the moment all of Jacob's sons heard what had happened, they immediately came home. They were very angry with Shechem's act which shamed Israel's family by sleeping with their sister.
\p
\v 8 Then Hamor said to all of them, “Shechem, my child, really likes Dinah, your(pl) daughter. For that reason I ask your approval so that he can marry your(pl) daughter.
\v 9 You can marry our daughters and allow us to marry your daughters.
\v 10 You may settle with us and the land is open to you. Stay and freely trade here. You may own land here.
\p
\v 11 Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, “I ask that you be generous and fulfill my request, and whatever you ask, I will give.
\v 12 I will give everything that you ask as bride price, but I beg, give your daughter to me as wife.”
\p
\v 13 Because Shechem had already violated Dinah, their sister, then all the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor, his father craftily.
\v 14 They answered, “We can't give our younger sibling to a man who is not yet circumcised because a thing like that would shame us.
\v 15 We can only agree with the requirement, you become like us, that is if all your male relatives are circumcised.
\v 16 If you do that, then we are ready to give our daughters for marriage, and take your daughters as wives, and we will remain among you and we will become one people group.
\v 17 However, if you don't agree with our condition, then we will move from this region taking our younger sister away.
\p
\v 18 Hamor and Shechem felt happy with that requirement.
\v 19 Shechem— who was the most respected son of his extended family— didn't wait any longer and did what they had asked, because he really wanted Dinah.
\v 20 So Hamor and Shechem went to the city gate and said to the leaders of the city,
\v 21 “These people don't have a dispute with us. Let them stay here and trade, because in reality, this land is broad enough to accomodate them. We will marry their women, and vice versa they can marry our women.
\v 22 However, there is one requirement that they want us to fulfill to become one with us as one people group. Every male among us has to be circumcised just like they've been circumcised.
\v 23 If we do that, certainly their animal flocks, possessions and all of their other animals will become our possessions. So lets fulfill their request so that we can live together.”
\p
\v 24 All of the leaders who often gathered at the city gate agreed with what was said by Hamor and Shechem. So every male in the city was circumcised.
\v 25 Two days later,\f + \fr 34:25 \fk Two days later \ft Literally, ‘On the third day’. See the footnote at Gen. 22:4.\f* when they who were circumcised were still in pain, two of Jacob's children named Simeon and Levi, who were older 'womb' siblings of Dinah, took their swords and suddenly attacked the city and annihilated every male there.
\v 26 They also killed Hamor and Shechem, and brought Dinah home from Shechem's house.
\v 27 After that massacre, Jacob's other sons looted the city as pay back because their sister had been violated.
\v 28 They took all of the sheep, cows, and donkeys, as well as everything that was in the city and in the fields around it.
\v 29 They took all of the wealth, captured the small children, women and all of the possessions in the houses.
\p
\v 30 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You've already brought disaster upon me. People of Canaan and Perez together with all other citizens in these lands will think I have done a disgusting thing. They will unite to attack my family that is small in number, and we will perish.”
\p
\v 31 However Simeon and Levi answered, “Is it proper that he treated our younger sibling like a prostitute?”
