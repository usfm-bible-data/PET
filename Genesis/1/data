\s1 God created heaven, the sky and the earth
\b
\v 1 At the beginning of everything, God created heaven, the sky,\f + \fr 1:1 \fk heaven, the sky \ft The word in Hebrew which is often translated as ‘sky’ is plural. This means that the word can be translated as ‘heavens’ or ‘skies’. At the time of the writing of this book— which according to tradition was written by Moses— people imagined that heaven was above the sky, and heaven was considered having several levels. The highest level was (considered) the dwelling place of God. All of that is God’s creation.\f* and the earth.
\v 2 At that time the earth didn’t yet have a form or organization, The earth was very dark and covered with very deep water. And the Spirit of God was present above\f + \fr 1:2 \fk always was present above \ft Literally, God’s Spirit ‘moved’ above the surface of the water. The way God’s Spirit moved above the water is not clear, but because the word Spirit is the same as the word that means ‘breath’ in Hebrew, it can be imagined that maybe the movement of God’s Spirit was like a wind blowing. Basically, the presence of God’s Spirit means that the attention of God was focussed or aimed at the world which will be created by Him.\f* the surface of that water.
\s2 The first day
\p
\v 3 God said, “Be light!” Then that light appeared.
\v 4 God saw that the light was good. So He divided that light from darkness.
\v 5 God called that light ‘day’ and the darkness ‘night’. The first day ended when late-afternoon became night.\f + \fr 1:5 \fk The first day … \ft TSI translates according to the reckoning of the Jews, where a new day is considered to start when late-afternoon becomes night, not at the moment of dawn. The Jewish cultural way of determining the dividing-point of days is seen in Lev. 23:32.\f*
\s2 The second day
\p On the next morning,
\v 6 God said, “May there be an empty space\f + \fr 1:6 \fk empty space \ft The two Hebrew words translated as ‘empty space’ indicate a separation that now we know as the atmosphere. In Hebrew poetry that separation is portrayed by an arch in Job 22:14 and Amos 9:6.\f* that separates water on the earth from water above the earth.”
\v 7 Then that happened.
\v 8 God called the empty space ‘sky’. The second day ended when late-afternoon became night.
\s2 The third day
\p On the next morning,
\v 9 God said, “May the water that is under the sky gather in one place, so that dry ground can be seen.” Then that happened.
\v 10 God called the dry ground ‘land’, and the gathered water ‘sea’. God saw that that all that was good.
\v 11 Then God said, “May the ground produce different kinds of plants— including those that produce seeds and various types of trees whose fruit has seeds. Let it be that each kind of seed that is planted will produce plants or trees that are the same, according to their kind.” Then that happened.
\v 12 So the ground grew various kinds of plants— including those that produced seeds and various kinds of trees whose fruit had seeds. And every type of seed that was planted always produced plants or trees that are the kind as initially. God saw that all that was good.
\v 13 The third day ended when late-afternoon became night.
\s2 The fourth day
\p On the next morning
\v 14-15 God said, “May various bodies of light be in the sky so that their rays radiate to earth. Let those bodies show the difference between day and night, and become signs that determine days, years, and seasons.”\f + \fr 1:14 \fk seasons \ft The Hebrew word that is translated here as 'seasons' is also often translated as ‘religious holiday’ in the OT.\f* Then that happened.
\v 16 God made two great bodies of light. The biggest to shine\f + \fr 1:16 \fk shine \ft The word ‘shine’ in this verse and verse 18 translates two words in the Hebrew language that means 'to rule'. In ancient times the sun and moon were often considered as two gods, but it's best for us to consider that the use of the word ‘to rule’ is a metaphor of personification. By not mentioning the name of the two bodies as the sun and moon, the writer wanted to show that those two bodies that were created things, not gods.\f* in the daytime and the other to shine at night time. God also made many, many stars.
\v 17 God arranged all of the bodies in the sky to light the earth,
\v 18 shine in the day and night, and separate light from dark. God saw that all that was good.
\v 19 The fourth day ended when late-afternoon became night.
\s2 The fifth day
\p On the next morning
\v 20 God said, “May the water be filled with various species of living creatrues that swim, and the sky be filled with various species of birds that fly above the surface of the earth.”
\v 21 Then God created various kinds of sea animals that were big and all kinds of creatures that move in the water. He also created various kinds of winged creatures. God saw that all that was good.
\v 22 Then God blessed all of those living creatures and said, “Produce many offspring. May all of the creatures that live in the sea fill the sea, and birds fill the earth.”
\v 23 The fifth day ended when late-afternoon became night.
\s2 The sixth day
\p On the next morning
\v 24-25 God said, “May there be various kinds of living creatures on earth\f + \fr 1:24 \fk earth \ft Literally verse 24 begins with the sentence, “May the earth produce all kinds of animals…” Evidently this is a metaphor of personification, and God used the dirt in producing animals, in a manner that is similar to the creation of man in Gen. 2:7.\f*— including lifestock, wild animals, and those that creep and crawl on the face of the ground.” So God made all of the animals from dirt— that is lifestock, wild animals, and animals that creep and crawl according to their individual species. All of that happened according to the will of God, and God saw that all that was good.
\p
\v 26 Then God said, “Come let Us\f + \fr 1:26 \fk Us \ft Many Bible experts give two reasons why the Hebrew language uses ‘Us’ and not ‘Me’ here: 1) God spoke like a king, in which the words or orders of a king represent all of his government. Or 2) God the Father was speaking to God the Spirit who was mentioned in the first verse. It has been revealed in the New Testament that the Son also was involved in creation. See John 1, 1Cor. 8:6, Col. 1:16, and Heb. 1:2.\f* create man to have Our appearance/resemblance and have many attributes the same as Us. They will rule the whole earth— that is over the fish in the sea, birds in the air, all lifestock, wild animals, and animals that creep and crawl on the face of the earth.”
\q1
\v 27 So God created man so that he resembled Him.
\q2 He created them, male and female.
\v 28 Then God blessed them and said, “Bear many children and grandchildren. Live on the whole earth and rule over it. May you rule over the animals in the sea, in the air, and on earth.”
\v 29 God said to that man, “ Listen! I give to you every plant that produces seeds and all trees whose fruit has seeds. All of that is food for you(pl).
\v 30 But to all the animals of the earth, birds of the air, and animals that creep and crawl, I give all the green plants as food.” Then it happened that way.
\v 31 God saw that all that He had created was truely exceedingly good. The sixth day ended when late-afternoon became night.\f + \fr 1:31 \fk night and morning \ft The word ‘morning’ in this verse has been moved to Gen. 2:1.\f*
