\s1 God created the sky and earth
\p
\v 1 At the beginning God created the levels of the sky\f + \fr 1:1 \fk levels of the sky \ft The word ‘syamayim’ in Hebrew which is often translated ‘sky’ is in the plural, and that word can be translated as ‘heavens’. At the time of the writing of this book— which according to tradition was written by Moses, people imagined that heaven was above the sky. Sky or heaven were considered having several levels, and the highest level was (considered) the dwelling place of God.\f* and the earth.
\v 2 At that time the earth didn't yet have a form or organization. The earth was very dark and covered with very deep water. And the Spirit of God always was present above\f + \fr 1:2 \fk always was present above \ft Literally, God's Spirit ‘moved’ above the surface of the water. The way God's Spirit moved above the water is not clear, but because the word Spirit is the same as the word that means ‘breath’ in Hebrew, it can be imagined that maybe the movement of God's Spirit was like a wind blowing. At the least, the presence of God's Spirit means that the attention of God was focussed or aimed at the world which will be created by Him.\f* the surface of that water.
\p
\v 3 God said, "Be light!" So there was light.
\v 4 God saw that the light was good. So He divided that light from darkness.
\v 5 God called that light 'day' and the darkness 'night'. After that came afternoon, evening and morning. That was the first day.
\p
\v 6 Then God said, "May there be empty space
\f+ \fr 1:6 \fk empty space \ft In Hebrew the words 'mabdil ben' show a separation that now we know by the name atmosphere. In Hebrew poetry that separation is illustrated by a curve. that separates water on the earth from water above the earth."
\v 7 So that happened,
\v 8 and God called it 'sky'. After that there was afternoon, evening and morning. That was the second day.
\p
\v 9 The God said, "May the water that is under the sky gather in one place, so that dry ground can be seen." So that happened.
\v 10 God called the dry ground 'land', and the gathered water 'sea'. God saw that it was good.
\v 11 Then God said, "May the ground produce different kinds of plants— including those that produce seeds and various types of trees whose fruit has seeds. Let each kind of seed that is planted will produce plants or trees that are the same, according to their kind. Then that happened.
\v 12 So the ground grew various kinds of plants— including those that produced seeds and various kinds of trees whose fruit had seeds. And every type of seed that was planted always produced plants or trees that are the kind as the beginning. God was happy seeing all of that.
\v 13 After that there was afternoon, evening and morning. That was the third day.
\p
\v 14-15 Then God said, "May various bodies of light be in the sky so that their rays radiate to earth. Let those bodies show the difference between day and night, and become signs that determine days, years, and seasons."\f + \fr 1:14 \fk seasons \ft In the Hebrew language the word 'ulemowadim'— that is translated in the TSI as 'seasons' often has the meaning of religious holidays in the OT.\f* So that happened.
\v 16 God made two great bodies of light. The biggest to shine \f + \fr 1:16 \fk shine \ft The word 'shine' in this verse and verse 18 translates two words in the Hebrew language that means 'to rule'. In ancient times the sun and moon were often considered as two gods, but it's best for us to consider that the use of the word 'to rule' is a metaphor of personification. Notice that the author didn't call the name sun and moon, and by that he showed that the two bodies that were created were not gods.\f* in the daytime and the other to shine at night time. God also made many, many stars.
\v 17 God arranged all of the bodies in the sky to light the earth,
\v 18 shine in the day and night, and separate light from dark. And God was happy seeing that.
\v 19 After that, there was afternoon, evening and morning. That was the fourth day.
\p
\v 20 Then God said, "May the water be filled with various groups of living creatrues that swim, and above the face of the earth the sky be filled with various kinds of birds that fly."
\v 21 Then God created various kinds of sea animals that were big and all kinds of creatures that move in the water. He also created various kinds of creatures with wings. God was happy to see that.
\v 22 God blessed all of those living creatures and said, "Produce many offspring. May all of the creatures that live in the sea fill the sea, and birds increase much more.
\v 23 After that, there was afternoon, evening and morning. That was the fifth day.
\p
\v 24-25 Then God said, "May there be various kinds of living creatures on earth\f + \fr 1:24 \fk earth \ft Literally verse 24 begins with the sentence, "May the earth produce all kinds of animals..." Obviously this is a metaphor of personification, and God used the dirt in producing animals— like God created man. God did that work just with His order.\f*— including lifestock, wild animals, and those that creep and crawl on the face of the ground." So God made all of the animals from dirt— that is lifestock of all kinds, wild animals of all kinds, and animals that creep and crawl of all kinds. All of that happened according to the will of God, and He saw that all of it was good.
\p
\v 26 Then God said, "Come let Us\f + \fr 1:26 \fk Us \ft Many Bible experts give two reasons why the Hebrew language uses 'Us' and not 'I' here: 1) God spoke like a king— in which the words or orders of a king represent all of his government, or 2) God the Father is speaking to God the Son and God the Spirit. Number 1 is more likely according to the author and readers of ancient times, but the second isn't wrong for us who read in today's age. \f* create man to look like US in every way, so that they rule the whole earth— that is over the fish in the sea, birds in the air, all lifestock, wild animals, and animals that creep and crawl on the face of the earth."
\q1
\v 27 So God created man so that he looked like Him.
\q2 Man was created to look like God in all ways.
\m
\q2 He created them man and woman.
\v 28 Then God blessed them and said, "Bear many children and grandchildren. Live on the whole earth and rule over it. May you rule over the fish, birds, lifestock, wild animals, and animals that creep and crawl."
\v 29 God said to the man, "I give to you every plant that produces seeds and all trees that produce fruit. All of that is food for you.
\v 30 I give all the green plants as food for all animals, birds, and animals that cree and crawl." So that happened.
\v 31 God saw that all that He had created was really very good. After that there was afternoon, evening and morning. That was the sixth day.
