\s1 Abram saved Lot
\p
\v 1-2 At that time a war broke out in the area of ​​Abram and Lot. There are four kings from the eastern region who joined forces to fight five kings from the western region. The four kings of the eastern region were King Amrafel of Babylon, Raja Ariok of Elasar, Raja Kedorlaomer of Elam and Raja Tidal of Goim. While the five kings of the western region were Bera Kings from Sodom, King Birsa of Gomorrah, King Sinab of Adma, King Semeber of Zeboiim, and King of Bela, also called Soar.
\p
\v 3 The five kings joined and gathered their army in the Valley of Sidim - the valley now covered with the Dead Sea.
\v 4 Before that, for twelve years, King Kedorlaomer took control of the five kingdoms of the western region and forced them to pay enormous amounts of tax to him. But in the thirteenth year they rebelled and refused to pay the tax.
\p
\v 5 In the [fourteenth / fourteenth] year King Kedorlaomer and the kings who joined him, came with their army and defeated the tribe of Rephaim at Asterot Karnaim, the Susim in Ham, the Emim in Sawe Kiryataim,\f + \fr 14: 5 \fm Refim ... Emim ...

\v 6 and the Hori who lived in the hills of Seir as far as El Paran - which was located near the desert.
\v 7 Then King Kedorlaomer and his allies returned to Abram and Lot's area and went to the city of Mispat - now called Kadesh. They defeated the Amalekites and took control of all their territory. Likewise with some Amorites who live in the city of Hasason Tamar.
\p
\v 8 Then the army of the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma, Zeboim and Bela mobilized their entire army to fight against the enemy army in the Sidim Valley.
\v 9 They fought a joint army from Kedorlaomer king Elam, Tidal king Goim, Amrafel raja Sinar, and Ariok raja Elasar. The combined strength in the eastern region fought the combined strength of the western region, so the four combined forces fought five combined powers.
\v 10 In the Sidim valley there were lots of asphalt-filled holes.\f + \fr 14:17 \fk Asphalt pits \ft In Mesopotamia and Palestine there were quite large soil holes that occurred naturally - that is due to the overflow of material called 'asphalt' from the bowels of the earth. The asphalt that comes out is black brown and shaped like glue. The person or animal entering the asphalt hole will stick and cannot get out. If not helped, it will die there.
\F * When the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and his army fled, many soldiers fell into the pits filled with asphalt. Others, who managed to escape fled to the hilly region. v 11-12 The fourth king's army seized everything of value from Sodom and Gomorrah, including all food supplies. When this incident happened, Abram's nephew Lot named also lived in Sodom. The enemy forces captured him and seized all of his possessions. Then they set off again to the east.
\p
\v 13 But someone who worked for Lot managed to escape and reported the incident to Abram - who was indeed a Hebrew but was living as a migrant there. At that time Abram lived on the land of an Amor named Mamre. The land is a location where there are many large trees commonly used by local people to offer something to the gods. Mamre and his two brothers - Eskol and Aner, were Abram's allies.
\p
\v 14 When Abram heard that his nephew Lot had been taken prisoner, he mobilized 318 servants who had been trained as soldiers. These people were also born as Abram's servants. They - along with several soldiers from the three brothers who were allies with Abram,\f + \fr 14:14 \fk along with ... \ft This information was taken from Gen. 14: 24.\f * chasing the four enemy kings led by king Kedorlaomer to the north to the city of Dan.
\v 15 Abram divided his soldiers into groups. At midnight, they attacked the enemy simultaneously from various directions, and managed to defeat them. When the enemies fled, Abram and his soldiers chased them to the city of Hobah - which was located north of the city of Damsik. v 16 Abram and his men succeeded in recapturing all the possessions that had been confiscated, and Lot with all his possessions, including the women and other prisoners.
\s1 Melchizedek blessed Abram
\p
\v 17 When Abram returned home after he and his men defeated the army of King Kedorlaomer and his companions, the king of Sodom went to meet Abram in the Valley of Shaveh, which is also called the Valley of the Kings. The Valley of the Kings \ft Zaman now the valley is better known as the Kidron Valley- which is south of the city of Jerusalem.\f*
\p
\v 18 Melchizedek is king of Salem, \f + \fr 14.18 \fk Salem
\is the old name for Jerusalem.\f* and a priest who offers a burnt offering to the Most High God. He came out of Salem with gifts of bread and wine for all to thank Abram's victory.
\v 19 Then he blessed Abram, saying,
\q1 “May God Most High—
\q2 the Creator of the heavens and the earth,
\q2 bless you.
\q1
\v 20 Let us praise the Most High God
\q2 for he has helped you defeat your enemies!”
\p Then Abram sent a tenth of all their plunder to Melchizedek.
\p
\v 21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Do not give me your possessions, which you have taken away from their hand. I just ask you to return my citizens. "
\p
\v 22 But Abram answered the king of Sodom, “I have sworn to the Lord God Most High, the Creator of heaven and earth,
\v 23 I will not take anything from you, even a thread or slippers, no! That way you will not be able to say, ‘The booty of me that made Abram rich.’
\v 24 I will not take anything for myself except what my servants have eaten. But let my friends - Aner, Eskol and Mamre, take their part.”
