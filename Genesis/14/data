\s1 Abram saved Lot
\p
\v 1-2 At that time a war broke out in the area of Abram and Lot. There were four kings from the eastern region who joined forces to fight five kings from the western region. The four kings of the eastern region were King Amrafel of Babylon, King Ariok of Elasar, King Kedorlaomer of Elam and King Tidal of Goim.\f + \fr 14:1-2 \fk Goim \ft The word ‘Goim’ in Hebrew has the meaning of ‘nations’, so this phrase can mean that King Tidal was the king over several nations. But because all those in this list are kings over a region or capital city, then Goim can be considered a region also.\f* While the five kings of the western region were King Bera from Sodom, King Birsa of Gomorrah, King Sinab of Adma, King Semeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, also called Soar.
\p
\v 3 The five kings joined and gathered their armies in the Valley of Sidim, the valley now covered with the Dead Sea.
\v 4 Before that, for twelve years, King Kedorlaomer ruled over the five kingdoms of the western region and forced them to pay enormous amounts of tax to him. But in the thirteenth year they rebelled and refused to pay the tax.
\p
\v 5 In the fourteenth year King Kedorlaomer and the kings who joined him, came with their armies and defeated the tribe of Rephaim at Asterot Karnaim, the Susim people in Ham, the Emim people in Sawe Kiryataim,\f + \fr 14:5 \fk Refaim … Emim … \ft The Refaim and Emim tribes were famous as giants who were mighty in the war. (Deut. 2:11, 2:20; 3:11)\f*
\v 6 and the Hori people who lived in the hills of Seir as far as El Paran, which is/was located near the desert.
\v 7 Then King Kedorlaomer and his allies returned to where Abram and Lot were and attacked the city of Mispat, now called Kadesh. They defeated the Amalekites and took control of all their territory. They did likewise to some of the Amorites who lived in the city of Hasason Tamar.
\p
\v 8 Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma, Zeboim and Bela mobilized their entire armies to fight against the enemy armies in the previously mentioned Sidim Valley.
\v 9 They fought the combined armies of Kedorlaomer king Elam, Tidal king of Goim, Amrafel king of Sinar, and Ariok king of Elasar. The combined strength in the eastern region fought the combined strength of the western region, so the four combined forces fought five combined powers.
\v 10 In the Sidim valley there were lots of tar-filled pits.\f + \fr 14:17 \fk tar-filled pits \ft In Mesopotamia and Palestine there were quite large holes in the earth that occurred naturally, which were the result of the flow of material called ‘tar’ from the bowels of the earth. The tar that comes out is black brown and is like glue. A person or animal which enters/falls into the tar hole will stick and cannot get out. If not helped, it/they will die there.\f* When the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and their armies fled, many soldiers fell into the pits filled with tar. Others, who managed to escape fled to the hilly region.
\v 11-12 The armies of the four kings seized everything of value from Sodom and Gomorrah, including all food supplies. When this incident happened, Abram's nephew Lot named also lived in Sodom. The enemy forces captured him and seized all of his possessions. Then they set off again to the east.
\p
\v 13 But someone managed to escape and report the incident to Abram. At that time Abram, that Hebrew man,\f + \fr 14:13 \fk a Hebrew man \ft Abram was called a Hebrew because he was a descendant of Eber. Lihat Kej. 10:21.\f* was living as a new-comer on the land of Mamre, an Amorite man, near a tree that was considered sacred.\f + \fr 14:13 \fk tree that was considered sacred \ft See the footnote at Gen. 12:6.​\f* Mamre and his two brothers named Eskol and Aner were Abram's allies.
\p
\v 14 When Abram heard that his nephew Lot had been taken prisoner, he mobilized his 318 servants who had been trained as soldiers. These men were born as Abram's slaves. So Abram's soldiers, along with the soldiers from the three brothers who were allies with him,\f + \fr 14:14 \fk along with …\ft This information was taken from Gen. 14: 24.\f* chased after the four enemy kings led by king Kedorlaomer toward the north until they reached the city of Dan.
\v 15 Abram divided his soldiers into several groups. At midnight, they attacked the enemy suddenly from various directions, and succeeded in defeating them. When the enemies fled, Abram and his soldiers chased them to the city of Hobah, which is located north of the city of Damascus.
\v 16 Abram and his men succeeded in recapturing all the possessions that had been confiscated, and Lot with all his possessions, including the women and other prisoners.
\s1 Melchizedek blessed Abram
\p
\v 17 When Abram was on the way home after he and his men defeated the army of King Kedorlaomer and his allies, the king of Sodom went to meet Abram in the Valley of Shaveh, which is also called the Valley of the Kings.\f + \fr 14:17 \fk the Valley of the Kings \ft In our time now the valley is better known as the Kidron Valley, which is south and close to the city of Jerusalem.\f*
\p
\v 18 Melchizedek is king of Salem,\f + \fr 14:18 \fk Salem \ft ‘Salem’ is the old name for the city of Jerusalem.\f* and a priest who offers burnt offering to the Most High God. He came out of Salem with gifts of bread and wine for all to celebrate Abram's victory.
\v 19 Then he blessed Abram, saying,
\q1 “May God Most High,
\q2 the Creator of the heaven, sky, and the earth,
\q2 bless you.
\q1
\v 20 Let us praise the Most High God
\q2 for he has helped you defeat your enemies!”
\p Then Abram gave over a tenth of all their plunder to Melchizedek.
\p
\v 21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “You need not give me the treasures and possessions which you have snatched from their hands. I just ask you to return my citizens.”
\p
\v 22 But Abram answered the king of Sodom, “I have sworn to the Lord God Most High, the Creator of the heaven, sky, and earth,
\v 23 that I will not take anything from you, not even a thread or a piece of a sandal strap! That way you will not be able to say some day, ‘The booty that originated with me has made Abram rich.’
\v 24 I will not take anything for myself except for what my servants have eaten. But let my friends, Aner, Eskol and Mamre, take their part.”
