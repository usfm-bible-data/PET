\s1 Jacob meets with Esau
\p
\v 1 From a distance, Jacob saw Esau with four hundred of his men already getting close to their direction. So he divided his family into four groups, that is Leah's group with her children, Rachel's group with her children, and the two other groups of the two women helpers with each of their children.
\v 2 Then Jacob placed the groups of the two women helpers, together with their children, in the front part. In the middle he placed Leah's group together with her children, and in the very back part he placed Rachel and Joseph.
\v 3 Whereas he himself took the position in the very front of them all. And as he walked toward his older brother, he bowed as many as seven times.
\v 4 But Esau ran to meet Jacob, hugged and kissed him. Then they just cried.
\p
\v 5 When Esau saw several women and the children, he asked Jacob, “Who are these people with you?”
\p Jacob answered, “They are the children that God has given to this servant of yours.”
\v 6 Then the two women helpers and there children came near, and bowed in front of Esau.
\v 7 Then Leah came near with her children and bowed in front of Esau. In the same way Rachel and Joseph, they came and bowed in front of Esau.
\p
\v 8 Esau said, “What is the meaning of several other groups that I met on my journey coming here?”
\p Jacob answered, “To gain your kindness of heart, Master, so you want to receive me.”
\p
\v 9 Then Esau answered, “My younger brother, I have enough already, what you own may it remain your possession!”
\p
\v 10 Then Jacob replied, "No! If master is really already kind hearted and receives me back, I request you to receive my gift. I'm very happy to return to see Master's face, it feels like I'm seeing the face of God.
\v 11 I request you to receive this I've brought, because God has been very kind hearted to me and has given me everything that I need.” Jacob continued to beg until finally Esau wanted to receive that gift.
\p
\v 12 Esau said, “Let's continue this journey, and let me travel in front of you and the people who are traveling with you.”
\p
\v 13 But Jacob replied, “My Master certainly knows that these children are still weak, and there are several goats and sheep along with cows that we brought that still feed their young milk. If they have to travel far in just one day, then all of the flocks will die.
\v 14 May my Master travel on ahead of us, and we will follow slowly, so that the cows and other flocks are safe and the children don't get too weary. Until we meet with my Master in Seir.”
\p
\v 15 So Esau said again, “If that's so, let me leave several of my men to travel with you.”
\p Then Jacob said, “You don't need to do that, Master! I am already very happy because I have your very great kind heartedness, Master.”
\p
\v 16 So Esau returned to Seir that day also,
\v 17 whereas Jacob traveled toward Sukoth. In Sukoth, Jacob made a house for his family and also made several pens for his flocks. That is why that place was named ‘Sukoth’ which means place of shelter.
\v 18 Quite awhile later, after Jacob and his family left Mesopotamia, they arrived safely in Shechem in the land of Canaan. Then they pitched their tents in a field close to that city.
\v 19 Jacob then bought the land where they tented from Hamor
\p (Shechem's father) for the price of one hundred silver coins.
\v 20 Then Jacob built an altar their and named it, ‘the God of Israel is the mighty God.’
