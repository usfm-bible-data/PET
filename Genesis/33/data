\s1 Jacob meets with Esau
\p
\v 1 From a distance, Jacob saw Esau with four hundred of his men already getting close to their direction. So he divided his family into four groups, that is Leah with her children, Rachel with her child, and the two slave women with their (individual) children.
\v 2 Then Jacob placed the groups of the two women slaves together with their children in front. In the middle was Leah's group together with her children, and in the very back he placed Rachel and Joseph.
\v 3 He himself walked in front of them all, and as he walked toward his older brother he bowed down seven times so that his face touched the ground.
\v 4 But Esau ran to meet Jacob, hugged and kissed him. Then they just cried.
\p
\v 5 When Esau saw the women and the children, he asked Jacob, “Who are these people with you?”
\p Jacob answered, “They are the children that God has given to this servant of yours.”
\v 6 Then the two fermale slaves and their children came near, and bowed in front of Esau.
\v 7 Then Leah with her children came near and bowed in front of Esau. In the same way also Rachel and Joseph came and bowed in front of Esau.
\p
\v 8 Esau said, “What is the meaning of the groups that I met on my journey coming here?”
\p Jacob answered, “To gain the kindness of heart of my Master so you would want to receive me.”
\p
\v 9 Then Esau answered, “My younger brother, I have enough already, let what you own remain your possession!”
\p
\v 10 Then Jacob replied, "No! If master is really already kind hearted and wants to receive me back, I request you to receive my gift. I'm very happy to see Master's face again, it feels like I'm seeing the face of God.
\v 11 I request you to receive this I've brought, because God has been very kind hearted to me and has given everything that I need.” Jacob continued to beg until finally Esau wanted to receive that gift.
\p
\v 12 Esau said, “Let's continue this journey, and let me travel in front of you and my people(men) will walk with you.”
\p
\v 13 But Jacob replied, “My Master certainly knows that these children are still weak, and we also brought several cows, sheep, and goats that still feed their young milk. If they have to travel far for just one day, then all of the flocks will die.
\v 14 May my Master travel on ahead of us. We will follow slowly, so that the cows and other flocks are safe and the children don't get too weary. Until we meet with my Master in Seir.”
\p
\v 15 So Esau said again, “If that's so, let me leave several of my men to travel with you.”
\p Then Jacob said, “You don't need to do that Master! I am already very happy to be able to have Master's kind heartedness that is great.”
\p
\v 16 So that day also Esau returned to Seir,
\v 17 whereas Jacob traveled toward Sukoth. In Sukoth, Jacob made a house for his family and also made several pens for his flocks. That is why that place was named ‘Sukoth’.\f + \fr 32:17 \fk Sukoth \ft The meaning of Sukoth is ‘resting place’.\f*
\v 18 Quite awhile later, after Jacob and his family left Padan Aram, they arrived safely in the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan. Then they pitched their tents close to that city.
\v 19 Jacob then bought the land where they camped from the family of Hamor— (Shechem's father, for the price of one hundred silver coins.
\v 20 Then Jacob built an altar their and named it, ‘The God of Israel is the Mighty God.’\f + \fr 33:20 \fk The God of Israel is the Mighty God \ft The pronunciation of this name in Hebrew is ‘El Elohe Israel’.\f*
