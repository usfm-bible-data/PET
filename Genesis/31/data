\s Jacob flees from Laban
\p
\v 1 One day, Jacob got news that all of the sons of Laban were grumbling about him to each other, “Jacob has taken our father's wealth. All of his wealth he got from our father.”
\v 2 Jacob also had observed that Laban's attitude toward him wasn't as it had been before.
\p
\v 3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your forefathers, and to your relatives. I will be with you.”
\p
\v 4 After that, Jacob ordered a person to call his two wives— that is Rachel and Leah— to meet him in the field, the place where he was herding his goats and sheep.
\v 5 When Rachel and Leah came, Jacob said to them, “I have observed that now your father's attitude has changed toward me. But God who is worshiped by my father, Isaac, is still with me.
\v 6 You yourselves know that I have worked hard for your father to the limit of my strength.
\v 7 But he has deceived me repeatedly by changing my wages. Even so, God didn't allow him to do evil to me.
\v 8 The proof is, when he said, ‘Tge goats and sheep that are speckled will be your pay.’ And it happened that all the goats and sheep were born speckled. And when he said, ‘The goats and sheep that are striped will be your pay.’ Then all the young goats and sheep were born striped.
\v 9 God has taken your father's livestock and given them to me.
\v 10 When the mating season arrived, I had a dream. And in that dream I saw that the male goats that mated with female goats were banded, striped, and speckled.
\v 11 In that dream there was an angel who conveyed God's message who called to me, ‘Jacob!’ I replied, ‘O LORD, I am here!’
\v 12 Then the angel said to me, ‘Look and note that all the male goats who mate with this herd of females have banded, striped, and speckled fur. I made everything like that because I've seen how Laban treats you.
\v 13 I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel, in the place where you set up a memorial stone and poured oil on it, and made a promise to Me. Now, get ready to go from this place and return to the land of your birth.’”
\p
\v 14-15 Rachel and Leah replied, “We know that for many years you have worked for our Father, as payment to get us as your wives. But now he has spent all the wealth that he received from your hard work, and we know that we won't get the slightest part of an inheritance. In fact, he treats us like strangers.
\v 16 All the wealth from our father that God has given you belongs to us and our children. So, do it according to what God has commanded you.”
\p
\v 17-20 Jacob deceived Laban— the Aramean— by leaving without telling him. When Laban and his workers and all of his relatives had gone to the fields to cut the fur of their sheep,\f + \fr 31:19 \fk and his workers and … \ft Literally, “When Laban had gone to shear …” Implicit in that statement, and understood by all original readers is that the work of shearing the wool of a flock of hundreds of sheep was a huge job. It could not be done by Laban all by himself. All of Laban's slaves would certainly be involved and Laban's relatives would have been asked to help. The customs of sheep shearing can be seen in 1 Samuel 25.\f* hurriedly Jacob departed with his wives and children riding camels heading to Canaan, to the place of Isaac, his father. Jacob also told his slaves to bring all the livestock and the property which he had obtained while working in Padan Aram. But without telling Jacob, Rachel had already stolen the family-protecting statues belonging to her father.
\v 21 Jacob took all his wealth and crossed the Euphrates River heading to the hills of Gilead.
\s Laban chases Jacob
\p
\v 22 Two days later,\f + \fr 31:22 \fk Two days later \ft In Hebrew, it literally says, ‘Three days later’ but for the Hebrew people the day of departure is also counted.\f* someone told Laban that Jacob had run away.
\v 23 On hearing that news, Laban immediately took a contingent/group\f + \fr 31:23 \fk contingent \ft Literally the Hebrew says ‘his brothers’, but the meaning can be understood to be wider than just his relatives.\f* to chase Jacob. After traveling seven days, they finally met Jacob close to the hills of Gilead.
\v 24-25 When Laban found them, Jacob had made his encampment in those hills. So, Laban and his company pitched their encampment close to Jacob's place. That night when Laban was sleeping, God came to him in a dream and said, “Pay attention! When you meet with Jacob, don't say anything to him in anger.”
\p
\v 26 Later, when Laban met with Jacob, he said, “What is this that you've done! You have deceived me by taking away my daughters like captives of war.
\v 27 Why have you deceived me by running away secretly? If you had just told me, then I would have allowed your departure with gladness. I would have accompanied your departure with singing with tambourine and harp.
\v 28 I in fact didn't have the opportunity to kiss my grandchildren and daughters expressing wishes for a safe trip to them. These actions of yours were very stupid!
\v 29 I have the power to harm, however last night the God whom your father worships forbade me from saying anything to you in anger.
\v 30 And now you have decided to go with the reason that you very much miss your father. But why did you also steal my idol statues?”
\p
\v 31 Then Jacob answered him, “I left secretly because I was afraid that Uncle would try hard to withhold/restrain your daughters using force, so that I wouldn't be able to take them and go.
\v 32 But regarding your/Uncle's idols, whoever is found to have stolen them, let him die! With our brothers witnessing, you/Uncle may examine for yourself if there is anything belonging to Uncle/you among our baggage. If they is something, you may take it.” Jacob spoke like that because he didn't know that Rachel was the one who had stolen those idols.
\p
\v 33 So Laban began looking for the aforementioned idols. He looked for them in Jacob's tent, then in Leah's tent, and after that in Zilpah and Bilhah's tents,\f + \fr 31:33 \fk Zilpa dan Bilha's tents \ft In Hebrew, literally, ‘the tents of the two slave women’. Zilpah was the slave of Leah, and Bilhah was the slave of Rachel. See 29:24, 29; 30:4, 9.\f* but he didn't find the previously mentioned statues. Then he entered Rachel's tent.
\v 34 At that time, Rachel had already hidden those idols in her camel saddle and sat on top of the saddle. So the moment Laban searched in her tent, he didn't find anything.
\v 35 The moment Laban was busy examining Rachel's tent, Rachel said to her father, “Father, I apologize to you. I can't stand up from my seat to welcome Father/you because I'm menstruating.” So Laban didn’t find the idols there.
\p
\v 36 Jacob was mad and rebuked Laban, saying, “What is my error and sin that you/Uncle chase me like chasing a criminal?!
\v 37 You have checked out all of our stuff! Have you/Uncle found your/Uncle's stuff?! If so show it here in front of your/Uncles's brothers and my brothers, so they are the ones to decide who is right between us two!
\p
\v 38 Twenty years long I've lived with you/Uncle and worked hard raising your/Uncle's goats and sheep so they could give birth to many young. And I never even once ate the meat of your/Uncle's flock.
\v 39 Uncle/you always demanded that I replace for you every animal that was stolen in the day or the night. In fact those that died torn apart because they became prey to wild animals, I never have brought to you/Uncle.
\v 40 I often suffered because I had to endure the heat of the day, and the cold of night, along with almost not having time to sleep.
\v 41 That's what you/Uncle did to me for twenty years living in your/Uncle's house. I worked like a slave— fourteen years to get your/Uncle's two daughters, and six years to get these flocks as my wages. But during that time you/Uncle changed my wages repeatedly.
\v 42 If the God of my ancestors— that is the God who was worshiped by Abraham and Isaac— wasn't with me, then certainly you/Uncle would have ordered me to go empty handed! But God saw that I have worked hard and you/Uncle kept making me suffer. That's why last night He rebuked you/Uncle and showed that you/Uncle are wrong!”
\s Jacob and Laban make a peace promise
\p
\v 43 So Laban answered Jacob, “These two women are my children, and the children they birthed are my grandchildren, and these flocks are mine. Everything you see is mine. But I would never harm my children and grandchildren!
\v 44 Because of that, let's make a binding covenant as a reminder that you and I have made peace.”
\p
\v 45 Then Jacob raised a large stone as a memorial monument.
\v 46 Jacob also asked his brothers to gather a number of stones. Then they just took those stones and arranged them to form a pile. After that they ate next to that pile of stones.
\v 47 Laban named the pile of stones Jegar-sahadutha,\f + \fr 31:47 \fk Jegar-sahadutha \ft Laban named that pile of stones in the Aramaic language ‘Jegar-sahadutha’ which means ‘pile of stones to remind us’.\f* but Jacob named it Galeed.\f + \fr 31:47 \fk Galeed \ft Jacob named that pile of stones in the Hebrew language ‘Galeed’ which means ‘pile of stones to remind us’.\f*
\p
\v 48 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Today, in accordance with the name you gave,—that is Galeed— then let this memorial monument of this promise become a witness between me and you.
\v 49 This memorial monument will also be called Mizpah,\f + \fr 31:49 \fk Mizpah \ft The meaning of the name Mizpah is ‘watch tower’.\f* because it is the LORD who will watch what you and I do when we have separated.
\v 50 If you hurt the heart of my daughters or take other women as your wives other than these two— even though there is not a witness to tell me about it— then remember that God will become a witness of that action.”
\v 51 Then he said again to Jacob, “Notice this pile of stones and monument that we raised, which I place between you and me.
\v 52 I will remember that I can't pass this pile of stones and monument with the purpose of doing evil to you. Likewise also the reverse, you must not pass this to do evil to me.
\v 53 May the God who was worshiped by Abraham, and the God\f + \fr 31:53 \fk Allah \ft According to Hebrew grammar, Laban thought that the God who was worshiped by Abraham and the false god who was worshiped by Nahor had the same status as dieties. In this situation, the TSI shows that Laban's opinion was wrong by capitalizing god of Nahor. \f* who was worshiped by Nahor become a judge between us.” Then Jacob promised in the name of the God who was worshiped by Isaac, his father.
\v 54 Then Jacob gave a sacrificial offering on that hill and invited all of the family of Laban to eat together. Then they ate and spent the night there.
\v 55 The next day, early in the morning, Laban woke and gave farewell kisses to his grandchildren and children along with blessing them. After that, Laban went home.
