\s Joseph's Dreams
\b
\p
\v 1 Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, the land where his father stayed before.
\v 2 This is what happened to Jacob's descendants.
\p When Jacob's son Joseph was seventeen years old, one of his duties was to heard his father's flock of sheep together with his step brothers— that is Jacob's children from his two wives named Bilhah and Zilpah. One time, Joseph reported to his father the evil things that were done by those brothers of his.
\v 3 It happened that Jacob was more loving to Joseph compared to his other children, because Joseph was born when he was already very old. So Jacob gave orders to someone to make a beautiful and colorful robe as a special gift to Joseph.
\v 4 When Jacob's other children realized tht their father loved Jacob more, then they began to hate Joseph and didn't want to speak well with him any more.
\p
\v 5 The feeling of hatred of his brothers grew more and more when Joseph told them what happened in his dream.
\v 6 Joseph said to them, “I will tell my dream to you all.
\v 7 In that dream, we were working together bundling wheat in the field. Suddenly my wheat bundle stood up, and all of your wheat bundles surrounded and bowed down to my wheat bundle.”
\p
\v 8 His brothers replied, “Oh, so you think that some time later you will rule and have power over us?!” Then they hated Joseph more because of his dream and those words of his.
\p
\v 9 Then Joseph dreamed again, and he told it to his older brothers, saying “I have dreamed again, and in my dream I saw the sun, moon and eleven stars bow down to me.”
\p
\v 10 When Joseph told his dream to his father, he was rebuked, “What is it that you've dreamed?! You think that I, your mother and your brothers will come and bow down and worship you?!”
\v 11 So his brothers became more jealous of him, but his father pondered Joseph's words and thought about the meaning of that dream of his.
\p
\v 12 One day when Joseph's brothers were herding sheep and goats in Shechem,
\v 13 Jacob said to Joseph, “Go to Shechem. Your brothers are herding sheep and goats there.”
\p Joseph answered, “Good father, I will go!"
\p
\v 14 Jacob continued, “Go there, and see what your brothers situation is and our flocks of sheep and goats, then return and report to father.” So Jacob let Jospe go leaving the valley of Hebron. When he got to Shechem,
\p
\v 15 Joseph wandered here and there seeking his brothers in the field. There was a person observing him and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
\p
\v 16 Joseph replied, “I'm looking for my brothers who are herding livestock. Have you seen them and know where they've gone?”
\p
\v 17 The person answered, “They have gone. I heard them say to each other, ‘Lets go to Dothan.’” So Joseph followed his brothers and met them in Dothan.

\p
\v 18 When his brothers saw Joseph from a distance, they made a pact to kill him.
\v 19 They said to each other, a yang lain, “Look, the dreamer is coming!
\v 20 Come, lets just kill him, and throw his body into the empty well. Then later we'll say that a wild animal attacked him. We will see what happens to those dreams of his!”
\p
\v 21-22 When Reuben heard that, he said, “Don't destroy him.”— because actually Reuben intended to save Joseph from them and bring him home to their father. Reuben continued, “Don't shed blood. Just throw him into the empty well that is in this desert, but no need to hurt him.”
\p
\v 23 So when Joseph reached their place, his brothers immediately roughly took off Joseph's robe that was colorful,
\v 24 then they threw Joseph into the empty well.
\v 25 After that they sat down while eating. And when they cast a glance, a group of groups of merchants was seen by them, that is Ishmaelites from Gilead. They were headed to Egypt with their camels that were bringing merchandise in the form of spices, balsam and myrrh.
\p
\v 26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What good is it to kill him and hide his body?
\v 27 What if we sell him to those merchants? Then we won't kill him. Because how could that be, he is our own flesh and blood.” His brothers also received that suggestion.
\v 28 So when the Midianite merchants who were Ishmaelites passed by, they took Joseph out of the well and sold him to those merchants for the price of twenty silver coins. Then the merchants brought Joseph to Egypt.
\p
\v 29 When Reuben returned to the well and saw that Joseph wasn't there, he tore his clothing because he really regretted it..
\v 30 Then he returned to his brothers and said, “That child isn’t in the well! What will I do?!”
\p
\v 31 Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph's robe into the goat's blood.
\v 32 They took that robe to their father and said, “We found this. Please examine whether or not this is your child's robe?”
\p
\v 33 Jacob recognized the robe and said, “This truly is my child Joseph's robe. Certainly a wild animal has attacked and tore him to death.”
\v 34 Then Jacob tore his clothing because of sadness and only tied on sackcloth around his waist. He mourned for his child for many days.
\v 35 All of Jacob's other children, both girls and boys tried to comfort their father, but he didn't want to be comforted. He said to them, “Let me grieve until the day I die!” Jacob was just continually said over the death of his child Joseph.
\p
\v 36 Meanwhile, in Egypt, the Midianite merchants sold Joseph to a person named Potiphar— whose position was commander of a troop of the king's guards.
