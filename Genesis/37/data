\s Joseph's Dreams
\b
\p
\v 1 Jacob lived in Canaan, where his father stayed before.
\v 2 This is what happened to Jacob's descendants.
\p When Joseph was seventeen years old, he often herded his father's flock of goats and sheep together with his half brothers— that is Jacob's children from his two slave wives named Bilhah and Zilpah. One time, Joseph reported to his father the evil things that were done by his brothers.
\v 3 It happened that Jacob\f + \fr 37:3 \fk Jacob \ft Literally in this verse the source language text calls his name Israel. (Gen. 32:28) Beginning with this chapter, the source text frequently alternates between his two names. The TSI will more often use the name Jacob for the man himself, whereas the name Israel will be used for the nation which is descended from him. \f* was more loving to Joseph compared to his other children, because Joseph was born when he was already very old. So Jacob gave orders to someone to make a beautiful and colorful robe as a special gift to Joseph.
\v 4 When his older brothers realized that their father loved Jacob more, they hated Joseph and didn't want to speak well with him any more.
\p
\v 5 They hated Joseph more when he told his dream to them.
\v 6 Joseph said to them, “Listen, I want to tell my dream.
\v 7 In my dream, we were working together bundling wheat in the field. Suddenly my wheat bundle stood up, and all of your wheat bundles surrounded and bowed down to my wheat bundle.”
\p
\v 8 His brothers replied, “So you think that you will rule and have power over us?!” Then they hated Joseph more because of his dream and those words of his.
\p
\v 9 Then Joseph dreamed again, and he told it to his older brothers, “I have dreamed again, in my dream I saw the sun, moon and eleven stars bowing down to me.”
\p
\v 10 When Joseph told his dream to his father, he was rebuked, “What is it that you've dreamed?! You think that I, your mother and your brothers will come and bow down and worship you?!”
\v 11 So his brothers became more jealous of Joseph, but his Jacoc pondered the words and the meaning of that dream.
\p
\v 12 One day when Joseph's brothers were herding goats and sheep in Shechem,
\v 13 Jacob said to Joseph, “Go to Shechem. Your brothers are herding goats and sheep there.”
\p Joseph answered, “Good father, I will go!"
\p
\v 14 Jacob continued, “Go there, and see what your brothers situation is and our flocks of goats and sheep, then return and report to father.” So Jacob let Joseph go leaving the Valley of Hebron.
\p When he got to Shechem,
\v 15 Joseph wandered here and there seeking his brothers in the field. A person observed him and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
\p
\v 16 Joseph replied, “I'm looking for my brothers who are herding livestock. Have you seen them and know where they've gone?”
\p
\v 17 The person answered, “They have gone. I heard them say to each other, ‘Lets go to Dothan.’” So Joseph followed his brothers and met them in Dothan.

\p
\v 18 When his brothers saw Joseph from a distance, they made a pact to kill him.
\v 19 They said to each other, “Look, the dreamer is coming!
\v 20 Come, lets just kill him, and throw his body into the empty well. Then later we'll just say that he was attacked and eaten by a wild animal. We will see what happens to those dreams of his!”
\p
\v 21-22 When Reuben heard this, he said, “Let's not kill him.” Reuben intended to save Joseph from them and bring him home to their father. Reuben continued, “Don't shed blood. Just throw him into the empty well that is in this desert, but no need to hurt him.”
\p
\v 23 So when Joseph reached his older brothers, roughly they immediately took off Joseph's robe that was colorful,
\v 24 then they threw Joseph into the empty well.
\v 25 After that they sat down to eat. When they looked in the distance, there was a large group of merchants— including Ishmaelites from Gilead, who were carrying merchandise in the form of spices from tree sap\f + \fr 37:25 \fk ... tree sap \ft Literally in English, ‘aromatic gum (sap from the rockwood plant), balm (sap from the mastic tree), and Myrrh’.\f* with their camels heading to Egypt.
\p
\v 26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What good is it to kill him and hide his body?
\v 27 What if we sell him to those merchants? Then we won't kill him, because he is family and has the same father as us.” So his brothers agreed.
\v 28 So when the Midianite merchants who were Ishmaelites passed by, they took Joseph out of the well and sold him to those merchants for the price of twenty silver coins. Then the merchants brought Joseph to Egypt.
\p
\v 29 When Reuben returned to the well and saw that Joseph wasn't there, he tore his clothing because he really regretted it..
\v 30 Then he returned to his brothers and said, “That child isn’t in the well! What do I need to do?!”
\p
\v 31 Then they killed a goat and dipped Joseph's robe into the goat's blood.
\v 32 They took that robe to their father and said, “We found this. Please examine if this robe belongs to your child?”
\p
\v 33 Jacob recognized the robe and said, “True, this is the robe of my child Joseph. Certainly a wild animal has attacked and tore him to death and eaten him.”
\v 34 Then Jacob tore his clothing because of sadness and tied on sackcloth around his waist. He mourned for his child for many days.
\v 35 All of Jacob's other children, both girls and boys tried to comfort their father, but he didn't want to be comforted. He said to them, “Let me grieve until the day I enter Sheol!”\f + \fr 37:35 \fk Sheol \ft In all of the age of the Old Testament, the Israelites conceived of Syeol as a collection/storage place of the souls of dead people. That place is dark and there is no joy/rejoicing. It was thought to be under the world and far from heaven. Sometimes in poetry of the OT, the door of Sheol was spoken of as at the bottom of the deepest ocean. So Sheol is not identical with paradise, heaven, or hell. The word Sheol is often translated more generally as ‘death’ or ‘the pit of the grave’.\f* Jacob was continually sad about the death of Joseph, his son.
\p
\v 36 Meanwhile, in Egypt, the Midianite merchants sold Joseph to a commander of a troop of the king's guards named Potiphar.
