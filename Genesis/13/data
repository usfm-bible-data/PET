\c 13
\s1 Abram and Lot parted ways
\p
\v 1 So Abram and Sarai left Egypt. Abram brought all his possessions, and Lot's nephew also came with him. He and his family went to the Negev— that is the desert region located in the southern part of the land of Canaan.
\v 2 As for Abram[,] he was very rich. He has a lot of cattle, silver and gold.
\v 3-4 Abram and his family lived [by/in a manner of] moving around. They moved from the Negev to live in several other places, which could produce food for them and for their livestock, so that they finally arrived at the place where Abram had once set up camp— that is between Bethel and Ai. That was the place where he previously built an altar of stones to offer some animals and ask the Lord for help.
\p
\v 5 Lot, who was on the move with Abram, also had many sheep and goats. Lot's camp was also extensive, because— like Abram, he had many slaves.
\v 6-7 Because of their increasing livestock, Abram and Lot were forced to no longer live in the same place. The land did not have enough water and green grasslands for all their livestock. Additionally, the Canaanites and Peres also lived there. So there was a dispute between Abram's and Lot's shepherds.
\p
\v 8 Abram said to Lot, “Because we are brothers, it is not good if your slaves and my slaves to fight with each other.
\v 9 So, let us separate, and let you be the first one to choose a place (to go). There are many areas that are still open to us. If you want the one over there, I'll stay here. If you want the one here, I'll go over there.”
\p
\v 10 Then Lot stretched his gaze and saw that the entire Jordan Valley reaching to Zoar was watered by many streams— like the Eden garden and the Egyptian land near the Nile. (This was happenning before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
\v 11 So Lot chose land in the area. He moved eastward from Abram's place. Thus the two separated.
\v 12 So Abram settled in the area of Canaan, while Lot settled in the Jordan valley near the city of Sodom.
\v 13 But those who lived in the city of Sodom were extraordinarily evil and sinful in the LORD's sight.
\s1 Abram moved to Hebron
\p
\v 14 After they separated, God said to Abram, “Stretch your gaze east, west, north and south from where you stand.
\v 15 I will give all the land that you see to you and your descendants forever.
\v 16 I will give you very many offspring, like the amount of earth-dust of the world! As people cannot count the amount of earth-dust, so your total number will not be possible to count.
\v 17 Now go and explore all the land, for I will give it to you.”
\p
\v 18 So Abram moved from that place closer to Hebron and settled near the oak trees that were considered sacred,\f + \fr 13:18 \fk trees that were considered sacred \ft See the footnote at Gen. 12:6.\f* belonging to a man named Mamre, near Hebron. In that place he built an altar to worship the LORD.
