\v 1 To my beloved Brothers and Sisters in the faith in the church of God at Corinth, and to all of God’s people in the whole region of Achaia:
\p Greetings from Paul, who became an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and from Timothy, our brother in Christ.
\p
\v 2 I pray that God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to each of you, and watch over you so that you live calmly under our Father’s and our Lord’s protection!
\s Paul gives thanks to God
\p
\v 3 Praise God, the Father of our Lord Christ Jesus, the Father who is full of compassion, and He who always encourages us!
\v 4 He’s the One who encourages\f + \fr 1:4 \fk encourages \ft translates the word ‘parakaleo’ in Greek. This word is often used in this letter. The PET usually translates this word with ‘encourage’, but its meaning can also be to comfort, urge, exhort and teach.\f* us so that we’re able to face all the suffering that we experience. For when we’re strong, we can encourage other people who are experiencing various kinds of suffering. They’re encouraged when we testify to them of how God has encouraged us through the sufferings that we experience.
\v 5 For just like Christ suffered in this world, we who serve Him also suffer. And if we suffer more and more for Christ, He also encourages us more and more, so that we can encourage other people.
\v 6 For example, if we’re made to suffer, that is to encourage you and is for your salvation too. And when Christ encourages us, that also gives encouragement to you, so that you endure patiently when you experience suffering like we experience.
\v 7 We have great hopes for you, for we know that you suffer too, just like we suffer. So you’ll be encouraged by Him too, of course, just like we’re always encouraged.
\p
\v 8 Brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the persecution that we experienced in the province of Asia. We had a heavy burden there, beyond our strength, so that we gave up on life.
\v 9 In fact, at that time we thought, “We’ll soon be killed!”, as if we’d already been sentenced to die. This happened so that we wouldn’t rely on our own strength, but on God ,who makes the dead live again.
\v 10 He’s the one who released us from that terrifying danger of death. And we keep hoping completely in Him to keep saving us.
\v 11 That help came about because each of you keeps supporting us in your prayers. And God will keep helping us, in answer to the prayers of many people, so that many people will thank Him.
\s Paul’s change of plans
\p
\v 12 This is what we’re proud of, and with my whole heart I say that this is true. Everything that we’ve done in this world, we’ve done with an honest and pure conscience which comes from God. And that’s becoming more clear in the work we’ve done with you. We’ve done it based on God’s kindness, not based on the wisdom of this world.
\v 13-14 We’re only writing things to you that you can read and understand. But just as you already partially understand us, I hope you’ll also understand us more completely. In that way, on the day our Lord Christ Jesus returns, I hope that you’ll also be proud because we’re the ones who carried on the ministry among you, just like we’re also proud of you!
\p
\v 15-16 So I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and also on my way back, full of hope to be able to go and serve you. I planned this so that you would be blessed twice, and to give you the opportunity to send me to Judea.
\v 17 But I have to change that plan. When you hear that, do you think I made plans thoughtlessly? Or maybe you think that I make plans like worldly people do who can’t be trusted because their plans are often thoughtless. For a while they say, “Yes, this is the plan”, and a while later say, “No, that’s not the plan.”
\p
\v 18 I promise you by God, who is always faithful, my attitude wasn’t like that!
\v 19 For in agreement with the news of salvation about the Son of God, our Christ Jesus, His plans were never thoughtless. The news about Him that Silas,\f + \fr 1:19 \fk Silas, \ft Literally, “Silvanus.”\f* Timothy and I myself tell is that Jesus isn’t a Person who will say “Yes” for a while, and a while later say “No.” He’s not that kind of a person! He’s very trustworthy!
\v 20 For to those of us who are one with Him, Christ Himself has proven that God will always be faithful to fulfill His promises to His people. And because of that, in Christ we also give thanks while glorifying God, and saying “Amen!”
\v 21 God Himself is the One who adds more proof of His faithfulness. He encourages you and encourages us so that we keep standing firm as followers of Christ, and He’s the one who has anointed us with His Spirit so that we’re able to serve Him.
\v 22 The Holy Spirit, who is in each of us, is like a stamp or a sign which shows that we’ve officially become God’s property, and the Spirit is the one who guarantees that God will fulfill all of His promises to us.
\p
\v 23 But now before God, I promise that what I’m telling is true. My reason for not returning to Corinth at this time is because I didn’t want my visit to make you even sadder and more ashamed because the problem in the church hadn’t been settled yet.
\v 24 My purpose, and that of the other apostles of Christ, isn’t to command how each of you in the Corinthian church live out your faith. We believe that each of you will keep standing firm in your faith. We just want to work with you so that you are more joyful because of living according to your faith.
