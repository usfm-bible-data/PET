\s1 Daniel in the royal court of Babylon
\p
\v 1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon with his war army came to invade Jerusalem and besiege that [town/city].
\v 2 And the Lord gave victory to Nebuchadnezzar over Jehoiakim, king of Judah and allowed him to loot some of the [objects/items of value] that were used in the House of God, to take back to the land of Babylon to put at the place of worship of his gods as part of his god's treasury.
\v 3 Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, head of the royal household to take some of the people of Israel who were decendants of the king or and of the nobility,
\v 4 that is youths which were healthy/without blemish, good appearance, han skills in various areas, wise, of knowledge, and suitable to work in the king's palace. They must be taught the language and literature of Babylon.
\v 5 The king commanded that those youth be given rationed food, that is food and drink that was the same as what the king ate and drank. They must [undergo/go through] education for three years, before serving the king in the palace.
\v 6 Among these young men were Daniel, Hananya, Misael, and Azarya who came from the tribe of Judah.
\v 7 So the head of the royal household gave them each names. Daniel changed names to become Belteshazzar, Hananya became Shadrah, Mieshael became Meschach, and Azariah became Abednego.
\v 8 But Daniel resolved that he would not eat the food or drink the drinks of the king because that would make him defile/not clean inaccord to religion. He asked permission from the head of the royal household to eat other food.
\v 9 God made the head of household in favor and compassionate towards Daniel.
\v 10 Then the head of the royal household said to Daniel, "I fear my lord the king, who has assigned what you must eat and drink. Why must he see if when your condition weakens and is not the same as the other young men of your age? You are putting my life at risk in the pressence of my lord the king."
\v 11 Then Daniel said to the supervisor who had been been assigned by the head of royal household to keep an eye on Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah,
\v 12 "As a test, give us vegetables to eat and water to drink for ten days.
\v 13 Afterthat, compare our being with that of the others that have eaten the kings food and make a decision based on your observation."
\v 14 The supervisor agreed and tested them for ten days.
\v 15 After ten days, they looked/appeared better and healthier compared to the other young men who had eaten the king's food.
\v 16 So the steward did not
