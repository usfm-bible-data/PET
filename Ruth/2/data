\s1Ruth works in Boas' field
\p
\v 1 In Bethlehem there was a rich and influential person named Boas. He had a family connection with Elimelech, Naomi's husband.
\p
\v 2 One day, Ruth the woman from Moab, said to Naomi, "Mother, because it is the harvest season now, may I go to a field to ask permission to gather barley heads that scatter and are permitted by the owner of the field to be taken?
\x+ Lev. 23:22\x* Who knows, there may be a kind-hearted person who will permit me to gather barley."
\p Naomi answered, "Good, go my child."
\v 3 Then Ruth went to gather barley heads that scattered from the bundles of barley. Not intentionally, Ruth worked in Boas' field— the relative of Elimelekh that was mentioned.
\p
\v 4 While Ruth was in the field, Boas arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the people who were harvesting his field, "The LORD be with all of you!"
\p Then they answered, "The LORD be with you too!"
\p
\v 5 Then Boas asked the foreman who was overseeing those people, "Who is the young woman over there and who are her family?"
\p
\v 6 The foreman answered, "She is the young woman from Moab that came back with Naomi.
\v 7 Earlier this morning she asked permission to gather heads of barley that scattered from the bundles of barley. She came very early, worked hard and only rested for a short while in the hut.
\p 8 Boas approached Ruth and said, "Listen to me my child. Stay here with us to gather the barley heads. You don't need to work in other people's fields. Stay close to the female workers that work in my field.
\v 9 Pay attention to the place they are working, then follow them. I have warned the male workers not to bother you. If you are thirsty, take water from the place water is kept."
\p
\v 10 Ruth knelt down before Boas saying, "I am not worthy to receive all of your kindness and mercy, Sir. I'm just a foreigner."
\p
\v 11 Boas answered, "My child, I know all that you've done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband. In fact you left both of your parents and the land of your birth in order to live here as a foreigner.
\v 12 Because of your generosity, may the LORD reimburse all of your hard work. May the LORD God of Israel bless you, because you came to be protected by Him.\f + \fr 2:12 \fk protected \ft Literally, “came (to be protected) under His wings.”These words of Boas' picture the Lord as a bird that protects its young under its wings.\f*
\p
\v 13 Ruth answered, "I hope to keep pleasing your heart, Sir! Even though I'm not a worker here, you have encouraged me by showing mercy.
\p
\v 14 At lunch time, Boas called Ruth, "Come here, and take this food for yourself. You can dip your bread in this vinegar." She sat with the workers and Boas gave her wheat that had been roasted. She ate until satisfied, and there still was leftover food.
\p
\v 15 When Ruth began to work again, Boas ordered his workers, "Let her gather heads of barley from the bundles of barley that have already been tied up.
\v 16 In fact, help her by intentionally dropping heads so that she can easily take them. Don't forbid her or stop her!"
\p
\v 17 Ruth worked all day gathering barley, and when she threshed it she got a basketful— more or less than twenty two liters. \f + \fr 2:17 \fk twenty two liters \ft Literally, “more or less than one ephah.”\f*
\v 18 She brought the produce of threshing barley home to the city and showed the produce to her mother-in-law. Ruth also gave her the left-over roasted wheat from her lunch.
\p
\v 19 "Where did you gather this much wheat?" Naomi asked. Where did you work? May the Lord bless him who paid attention to you!"
\p Then Ruth told what she had experienced, about the field owner where she worked. She said to her mother-in-law, "The owner of the field where I worked all day is Boas."
\p
\v 20 And Naomi said to Ruth, "May the LORD bless Boas! For it's clear that Boas \f + \fr 2:20 \fk Boas \ft This blessing that Naomi expressed ini can also be translated, “May he (Boas) be blessed by the Lord, who remains faithful …” It isn't clear in Hebrew if Naomi meant Boas or the Lord who was faithful to them.\f* is still faithful to us and to your husband who died. He is one of our closest relatives— one of those responsible for our family."
\p
\v 21 Then Ruth \f + \fr 2:21 \fk Ruth \ft Literally, “Ruth the Moabite woman.”\f* said, "Boas also said that I should come back and work with the workers the whole harvest season."
\p
\v 22 "Good!", said Naomi. "Do whatever he said, my child. Work with Boas' female workers the whole harvest season. You might just be bothered by people if you work in the field owned by another person. For that, do whatever he said."
\p
\v 23 So that's how Ruth kept working with the women workers in Boas' field until the barley harvest ended. After the barley harvest ended, Ruth continued her work gathering wheat heads that scattered during the wheat harvest season. She kept living with her mother-in-law.
