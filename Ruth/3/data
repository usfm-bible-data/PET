\s1 Ruth in the threshing place
\p
\v 1 One day Naomi said to Ruth, "My child, the time has come for me to find a husband for you, so that there is someone to watch over you.
\v 2 Boas is our close relative, and during this time he has been very kind-hearted to you by allowing you to work with the female workers. Tonight he will oversee the workers who clean the barley at the threshing place.\f + \fr 3:2 \fk clean the barley at the threshing place \ft The stalks with the heads were threshed using the force of an ox so that the seeds came out of the husks and the straw was cut into small pieces. Then all the produce of threshing was winnowed to seperate the seeds. That meant that by using a winnowing fork the produce of threshing was thrown into the air so that it was blown by the wind. The wind blew away the husks and pieces of straw, and the seeds fell back down to be gathered.\f*
\v 3 Now bathe, put on your best outer robe and wear perfume. Then go to the threshing place. However don't let Boas see you before he has eaten and drunk with other people.
\v 4 Take note of where he lies down to sleep. Then go close and lift the blanket from his feet and lay there. He will tell you what you must do.
\p
\v 5 Ruth answered, "I will do all that Mother has said."
\v 6 Then Ruth went to the threshing place and did all that her mother-in-law said.
\p
\v 7 After Boas was full of food and drink and feeling happy, he lay down at the edge of the pile of barley. After that Ruth quietly approached Boas, lifted the blanket from his feet and laid herself down.
\v 8 In the middle of the night, Boas woke up and was surprised to find a woman lying down near his feet!
\v 9 Boas asked, "Who are you?"
\p Ruth answered, "I'm Ruth, your simple servant! Take care of me, because you are the person responsible for my husband's family, Sir."
\p
\v 10 Boas answered, "May the Lord always bless you, my child! By coming to me like this, you truly show faithfulness to your husband's family, more than what you formerly showed to your mother-in-law, Naomi. You actually could look for a young man as a potential husband— whether rich or poor. But you have chosen me.
\v 11 Now don't worry, my child. I will do what I have to do, because everyone in this city knows that you are a woman who guards the family respect.
\v 12 It's really true, I am one of the persons responsible for your husband's family, but beside me, there is still a person who has a closer relationship to your husband.
\v 13 Now stay here tonight. Tomorrow morning if that person is ready to take responsibility for your life, let him take that responsibility. If not— by the LORD who lives, I will take the responsibility! Sleep here until morning."
\p
\v 14 Ruth lay there until early morning. But she got up while it was still dark so that other people didn't see her. Boas said to her, "Don't let anyone know that a woman came to the threshing place."
\v 15 Then Boas said to her again, "Spread out your outer robe and hold it so that I can fill it with barley." Then Boas took six measures \f + \fr 3:15a\fk six measures \ft The volume of the measure mentioned isn’t known.\f* of barley and poured it into Ruth’s outer robe. Then he helped Ruth so that she could carry it on her shoulders. Then Ruth f + \fr 3:15b \fk Ruth \ft Most of the Hebrew texts us he, but some of the Hebrew texts, the Syriac and Latin Vulgate use she.\f* returned to the city.
\p
\v 16 When Ruth went home to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "What happened, my child?"
\p Ruth told about all that Boas did for her,
\v 17 and Ruth added, "Boas gave me six measures of barley saying, 'You can't go home to your mother-in-law empty handed!'"
\p
\v 18 Naomi said, "Be patient my child, until we know what will happen. Boas will quickly finish this thing today."
