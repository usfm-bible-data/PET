\s1 Elimelech moves his family to the land of Moab
\p
\v 1- 2 At the time the judges ruled Israel, a famine came on all that region. Then a man named Elimelech moved from his home town— which was Bethlehem in the district of Judah, to a region in the land of Moab together with his wife and their two sons. His wife's name was Naomi. Their two sons were named Mahlon and Chilion. They came from the tribe of Ephrathites who lived in the town of Bethlehem in the district of Judah. They planned to live temporarily in the region of Moab.
\p
\v 3 Then Elimelek died, leaving Naomi and her two sons.
\v 4 Then the two sons married with two women who came from Moab. The two women were named Orpah and Ruth. But more or less ten years later,
\v 5 Mahlon and Chilion died. Finally Naomi was left all alone.
\s Naomi and Ruth go home
\p
\v 6 While Naomi was still in Moab she heard news that the LORD had blessed Israel— who are His chosen people in the region of Judah with a good harvest. So Naomi decided to leave the mountainous area of Moab and return to her land. Her two (daughter-)in-laws also decided to go with their (mother-)in-law.
\v 7 On the way from where they had lived while in Moab to Naomi's town in the region of Judah,
\v 8 Naomi said to her two (daughter-)in-laws, "Both of you, go home to your own mother's house! May the LORD return your kindness toward your husband who has died and also to me!
\v 9 And I hope the Lord will bless you so that you can return to live a peaceful life with a new husband." Then she kissed her two (daughter-)in-laws, and the three of them began to cry and mourn.
\p
\v 10 Orpah and Ruth said, "No! We will go with you to return to your family."
\p
\v 11 But Naomi answered, "Why do you want to return with me? It's not possible for me to give birth again to two sons to replace your husbands that have died!
\v 12 -13 Go home to your own parents' homes, because I'm already too old to marry again and give birth to two sons to replace your husbands. It's useless for both of you to hope that I will give birth to your replacement husband! Even if I got married tonight with a new husband, it's impossible for me to give birth again! It's better for your families to find you new husbands than for you to suffer along with me in a very difficult and bitter situation because the LORD has forsaken me!"
\p
\v 14 They also cried again with mourning, then Orpah kissed her (mother-)in-law, said goodbye and left. But Ruth kept hugging her (mother-)in-law.
\v 15 Naomi said to her, "Look, your older (sister-)in-law has already gone home to her family and will return to worshiping their gods. You should do the same thing too.
\p
\v 16 But Ruth answered,
\q1 "Don't order me to leave you.
\q2 Wherever Mother goes, I will also go;
\q1 Wherever Mother lives, I will also live there.
\q2 Your people will become my people
\q2 and your God will become my God.
\q1
\v 17 And where Mother dies, I will die also and be buried there.
\q2 I ask the Lord to punish me if I don't fulfill this promise of mine!
\q2 Only death will separate the two of us!"
\p
\v 18 Because Naomi saw that Ruth was determined not to change her decision to go with her, then she stopped ordering her to leave.
\p
\v 19 Then the two of them continued their journey. When they arrived in Bethlehem, all of the residents were astonished. The group of women asked, "Is this really Naomi?!"
\p
\v 20 Naomi answered them, "Don't call me Naomi, but call me Bitter, \f + \fr 1.20 \ft Naomi...Bitter The name Naomi means 'happy' or 'pleasing'. For the name 'Bitter', Naomi literally said 'Mara'. Besides meaning 'bitter', in the Hebrew language 'mara' also can be translated 'make sad'. \f* because The Almighty has made my life very bitter."
\v 21 When I left this place, I was content with what I had. But now the Lord has brought me home with empty hands. So why do you greet me with that first name of mine? For the LORD Almighty himself has brought misery to me\f + \fr 1.21 \ft brought misery to me These words can also be translated "has testified against me." \f* and made my life very bitter.
\p
\v 22 So that's the story of Naomi's return from the district of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth who came from Moab. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. \f + \fr 1.22 \ft barley Barley can be compared to unharvested rice. It's stalks are tall like stalks of rice and the seeds grow in a head. Barley grains are small, round and dark brown in color. Barley is often used for animal feed. Barley is also ground to make coarse flour, and baked to become coarse bread. Barley bread was usually only eaten by poor people. \f*
