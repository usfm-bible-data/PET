\s1 Boas marries Ruth
\p
\v 1 That morning Boas went to the meeting place at the city gate. Then the man whom Boas told Ruth about passed by— that is the one who had the closest relationship to Ruth's husband. Boas said to him, "My brother, sit here." So the man turned and sat with him.
\v 2 Then Boas gathered ten leaders of the city together as witnesses.
\v 3 Boas said to that man, "Naomi, the wife of the deceased Elimelech, our relative, has returned from Moab and wants to sell a piece of land.
\v 4 In front of these witnesses, I want to ask you brother about your readiness to redeem that land. If you want to redeem that land, then do it now. If not, let me know right away because after you, Brother, I'm the next responsible person.
\p Then the man answered, "Good, I will redeem that land."
\p
\v 5 Then Boas said to him, "Good, however you need to know Brother that beside redeeming a piece of land from Naomi, you also have to marry her (daughter)-in-law— who is Ruth the woman from Moab. In that way, when Ruth gives birth to her first son, the descendants of the family of Elimelech will not be lost from among us and that child will inherit the land in the name of the deceased Mahlon.
\p
\v 6 The man answered, "If that's so, I can't redeem the land mentioned, because that would make it difficult for the heir of the land that I already own. \f + \fr 4:6 \fk difficult for the heir\ft It isn't known now why the relative said that a child with Ruth would "endanger his inheritance." The reason may be because he wasn't rich like Boas and wasn't able to pay the finances tied up with buying the land and adding a wife. Or, if the person didn't yet have a first born child with another wife, if Rugh gave birth before his other wife, then Ruth's child would have the right as the firstborn child and inherit a greater portion of the person's possessionsand also inherit all that Mahlon owned. If after that the other wife gave birth to a son for him, then the child from that wife would only inherit as the second heir.\f* Brother you can just take the responsibility, because I can't.
\v 7 (Apparently the custom in Israel at that time was that whoever made an agreement to give up his right to another person, as a sign of that agreement he took off and gave one of his foot wear to the person who was ready to take the right mentioned. In general this thing made an agreement legitimate.
\v 8 So that man took off his foot wear and surrendered it to Boas while saying, "Brother, you just redeem that land."
\p
\v 9 Then Boas said to the leaders of the people and also to everyone who had gathered in that place, "Today, you are witnesses that I have redeemed Naomi's land and taken the transfer of responsibility of Elimelech, Chilion and Mahlon's land.
\v 10 Along with the land mentioned, I have gotten a wife— that is Ruth, the woman of Moab, the widow of my relative Mahlon. With the hope that Ruth will give birth to a son to continue the name of the family of her deceased husband and inherit the family owned land in his place of origin."
\p
\v 11 The leaders of the people and those who were at the city gate answered, "We are witnesses! Like the people of Israel who are the descendants of Rachel and Lea, may the LORD be pleased to bless the woman who enters your home! May you brother be blessed in your hometown of Ephrathah, and become well known in Bethlehem.
\v 12 May the Lord always give you descendants from this young woman like our ancestor Perez, the son of Tamar and Judah."

\s1 Boas' descendants
\p
\v 13 Then Boas took Ruth as his wife. The LORD blessed Ruth so that she conceived, then she gave birth to a son.
\v 14 The group of women in the city said to Naomi, "Praise God, who has blessed you with the birth of a son to carry on the family name! May this child be respected in all of Israel.
\v 15 You are very fortunate to have a (daughter)-in-law like Ruth who really loves you, because she is far more valuable than seven sons. She has now given birth to a grandchild for you who will make you happy. And when you are old, he will take care of you.
\p
\v 16 Naomi took her grandchild and held him full of compassion. She took care of him as if he was her own child.
\v 17 Her neighbors said, "Finally Naomi has a son!" And they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse and grandfather of king David.
\p
\v 18 Here is their line of descent, beginning with Perez— their ancestor:
