\c 9
\s Rights as an apostle which aren’t used by Paul
\p
\v 1 I’m speaking like that even though I’m free from obligations to anyone. I’m an apostle. I’ve seen Jesus our Lord. All of you are the result of my work as a representative of the Lord.
\v 2 There may be other people who don’t accept me as an apostle, but you certainly accept me! For all of you are proof that I work with the Lord’s authority.
\p
\v 3 This is my answer to the people who want to criticize me because the way I work is different than the way the other apostles of Christ work.
\v 4 Why are only Barnabas and I considered to be unworthy to be guests at one of your homes \f + \fr9:4 |fk guests … \ft literally "eat and drink."\f* when we visit?
\v 5 If, for example, Barnabas and I each have wives who are also of the same faith as us, are we the only ones who don't have the right like Peter, the other apostles and the younger siblings of the Lord Jesus to bring wives along on our trips?
\v 6 Or are just Barnabas and I forced to work to meet our living expenses?
\p
\v 7 Think about these examples. No soldier pays his own salary. It’s the same for a person who plants grapes in a vineyard, he has the right to eat the fruit of that vineyard. A shepherd has the right to drink milk from his flock.
\v 8 Of course these things make sense to everyone, but even more so because Moses’ Law says the same thing.
\v 9 For it’s written there, “Don’t muzzle the mouth of an ox that is used to trample wheat.\f + \fr 9:9 \fk trample wheat \ft Wheat was threshed to separate the grains of wheat from the stalk. During Bible times, wheat was threshed by an ox trampling it, or by an ox pulling a heavy tool that crushed it.\f* Allow it to eat the wheat while it’s working.”\x + \xo 9:9 \xt Deut. 25:4\x* Of course, when God said that, He didn’t just mean oxen.
\v 10 He was really talking about us apostles of Christ too. Everyone who works in the Lord’s field, both those who plow the ground as well as those who thresh the harvest, feel they have a right to enjoy something from the results of their work.
\p
\v 11 So if we’ve planted spiritual seeds among you, it’s natural for us to get some of the produce for our physical needs. Why not?!
\v 12 You give contributions to other teachers who preach in the church, and they have a right to receive those contributions, of course. That means that we certainly have more right to receive help than other people do. But we’ve never demanded that right! We bear the responsibility for all of our needs and are willing to face all kinds of difficulties instead, so that nothing will hinder others from receiving the Good News about Christ.
\p
\v 13 For example, remember that the priests who work in God’s House get food from what’s offered to the Lord. And those who serve at the altar of the Lord get part of the meat that’s sacrificed.
\v 14 In the same way, the Lord has determined that we who work to tell the Good News have the right to receive pay for our living expenses from that work of ministry.
\p
\v 15 But I’ve never demanded even one of those rights that are usually received by every apostle! And I’m not writing this to demand that you start giving something to me. For I take pride in the fact that I tell the Good News without being paid. And I would rather die than lose what I’m proud of!
\v 16 In my duty as an apostle, if I tell the Good News, it isn’t proper for me to brag about myself, because telling the Good News is my obligation. And I would really neglect my duty if I didn’t tell the Good News!
\v 17 If I were a wage earner, then it would be proper for me to expect wages. But I didn’t become the Lord’s servant by my own choice. It was the Lord who chose me as His servant and entrusted this task to me.
\v 18 So, what is my reward in this work of ministry? This is my reward, that I’m happy to tell the Good News without being paid and without demanding any physical reward as my normal right for the spiritual work that I do.
\p
\v 19 So I work free of all thoughts about physical rewards and am not obligated to anyone at all. Even so, I make myself like a servant who serves everyone, so that I can win as many people as possible for Christ.
\v 20 So when I’m with Jewish people, I live like a Jew. I do that in order to win them. And even though I myself have been set free from the bonds of the Law of Moses, yet when I’m with people who are still bound by Moses’ Law I also live like them. I do that so that I can win those whose lives are bound by Moses’ Law.
\v 21 But when I’m with those who live without thinking about the Law of Moses, that is the non-Jews, I also live like a person who doesn’t think about Moses’ Law. (I don’t actually forget God’s Law but I’m controlled by Christ’s Law.) I also live like that to win those who live without the Law of Moses.
\v 22 In the same way, when I’m with weak people I become like a weak person so that I can win them. So I try to adapt myself to various kinds of people with the hope that as many people as possible will be saved through my way of life.
\v 23 And I do all of that so that the Good News spreads more widely, so that someday I will take part in being blessed with all of you through that news of salvation.
\p
\v 24 Remember that in a race, all of the participants run, but only one wins and gets the prize. For that reason, let’s run in this spiritual contest in the same way, so that we’re worthy to become winners.
\v 25 Remember that all the participants in the race have taken part in harsh training, and they have to control themselves, too. They do all of that with the hope of receiving a crown\f + \fr 9:25 \fk crown \ft In a sports contest, the crown at that time was made from a wreath of leaves.\f* of appreciation. And that crown is just a worldly object which won’t last long. But our crowns will last forever.
\v 26 So I don’t run in this spiritual race like someone who runs without a certain goal. As an example of a different contest, I don’t act like a boxer whose attempted punches and blows don’t hit their target.
\v 27 Instead, I’m like an athlete who purposefully takes part in harsh training so that he can control his body and mind. I do that so that I won’t fail to receive the victory prize after I’ve urged other people to enter this spiritual race.
