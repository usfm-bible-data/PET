\s God’s wisdom does not lead to divisions in the church
\p
\v 1 And brothers and sisters, I couldn’t speak to you before as if speaking to people who are already one with God’s Spirit. I was forced to speak to you as people who were still controlled by their own desires, as if you were spiritual babies in the matter of following Christ.
\v 2 The teaching that I gave you was like milk, not like solid food. I did that because you weren’t yet able to receive adult food. Even now you still aren’t ready to eat spiritual food like that,
\v 3 because you are still controlled by your bodies desires. The fact that you are still jealous of each other and quarreling proves that you aren’t yet free from those desires. It means that you are still living like worldly people.
\v 4 That is proved because there are those of you who say, “I’m a follower of Paul,” and others say “I’m a follower of Apollos.” When you talk like that, you act just like worldly people.
\p
\v 5 Is Apollos an important person? No. Am I, Paul, an important person? No. We’re just servants of the Lord who are carrying out His tasks, and who help you to fully believe in Him.
\v 6 So I’m the one who planted the seed, Apollos is the one who watered it. But the One who makes that seed grow is God alone!
\v 7 Because of that, the servant who planted or the servant who watered aren’t important. God alone is important because He’s the One who makes that seed able to grow.
\v 8 So the servant who plants and the servant who waters actually have the same purpose and the same status. And each servant will receive a reward according to the work of his ministry.
\v 9 For we are equals as God’s servants, and you are like God’s own field.
\p And you are also God’s new House.
\v 10 According to God’s kindness which was given to me, I was given the task to lay the foundation of God’s House. That is, I was the one who taught you about Christ Jesus. So I was given the job of a builder. But now other people are building on top of the foundation that I made. For that reason, each person should be careful about the way he builds on top of that foundation.
\v 11 No one should try building on another foundation! Christ Jesus is the only foundation!
\v 12-13 On the Judgment Day\f + \fr 3:12-13 \fk the Judgment Day \ft Literally, “that day.”\f* God will test the value of the work of each person who built on top of that foundation. Then it will be seen whether or not the materials used to build will stand the test. It will be seen if the person built a room with materials that stand the test, like gold, silver or gem stones. And it will also be obvious if a person built a room with materials that are just temporary in nature, like wood, grass or straw, because each person’s work will be tested by fire on the Judgment Day.
\v 14 If the room that was built still remains standing after being tested, the person who built it will receive a reward.
\v 15 If his room burns up, he’ll feel the loss. Even so, he’ll be saved, but he’ll be like a person who runs away when his house is burned.
\p
\v 16 So you must understand that we are all God’s House, and God’s Spirit lives in us.
\v 17 If a person destroys God’s House, then God will also destroy him. For God’s House is holy, and we God’s people, are like His House.
\p
\v 18 Don’t let any of you deceive yourselves. If any of you feels that he’s wise according to the world’s standard, let him be stupid according to the world’s standard, so that he can be truly wise according to the Lord’s standard.
\v 19 For the world’s wisdom is stupidity to God. As it is written in the Holy Bible, “God uses the craftiness of wise people like a trap to catch them.”\x + \xo 3:19 \xt Job 5:13\x*
\v 20 And it is also written, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of wise people are useless.”\x + \xo 3:20 \xt Ps. 94:11\x*
\v 21 For that reason, don’t brag anymore about being followers of me, or Apollos, or another teacher. Because for us who are one with Christ, everything becomes our possessions.
\v 22 Everything is ours - Paul, Apollos, Peter,\f + \fr 3:22 \fk Peter \ft Paul literally wrote Peter's name as Cephas, like it is in Hebrew.\f* this world, life and death, things that are present now, and things that will come.
\v 23 That is true because we are all Christ’s possessions, and Christ is God’s possession.
