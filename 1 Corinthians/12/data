\s Special abilities given by God’s Spirit
\p
\v 1 Now, Brothers and sisters, I want you to understand about the special abilities that are given by God’s Spirit.
\v 2 You yourselves remember that before you became believers, you let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols which aren’t alive and don’t speak.
\v 3 So because of that, I want you to realize that it isn’t possible for a person who is led by God’s Spirit to say, “Jesus is cursed.” And a person can’t possibly say, “Jesus is Lord,” without the help of God’s Spirit.
\p
\v 4 There are many kinds of special abilities which are given by God’s Spirit as signs of God’s kindness,\f + \fr 12:4 \fk special abilities... God’s kindness \ft Literally translates one word in the Greek language. The root word also translates ‘kindness’, and also has special meaning as a term for the abilities that are given by God’s Spirit.\f* but all of those come from God’s Spirit alone.
\v 5 And even though there are many kinds of ministries, all of them come from the same Lord.
\v 6 In that way, God works in different ways in each brother in the faith, but the One and Only God alone does all of that.
\p
\v 7 Each of those abilities are given to us as visible signs from God’s Spirit and should be used to strengthen each other.
\v 8 For example, to some of us God’s Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice. To some others the same Spirit gives the ability to tell amazing knowledge.
\v 9 To others that same Spirit gives amazing certainty.\f + \fr 12:9 \fk amazing certainty \ft This word in Greek is also translated as “faith’ or ‘fully believe’.\f* And that one Spirit also gives the ability to heal sick people.
\v 10 And to others of us, the Spirit gives the ability to do miracles. And to others the ability to deliver messages received from the Spirit of God. \f + \fr 12:10 \fk deliver messages...\ft See the note in 1 Cor. 14:1\f* And to others the ability to determine if the news given comes from God’s Spirit, or an evil spirit. Others of us each receive the ability to speak in a new language according to the leading of God's Spirit. While there are others who receive the ability to translate what was spoken in that new language.
\v 11 The one same Spirit of God does all of this! And He’s the one who determines what ability is given to each of our brothers or sisters in the faith.
\s All believers are like the body of Christ
\p
\v 12 So just like the human body is only one but has many parts, in the same way we who are many are one body, which is the body of Christ.
\v 13 So there is no problem if our members are Jews or non-Jews, slaves or free people. Each of us has been, as it were baptized \f + \fr 12:13 \fk baptized... \ft This verse has been translated according to the interpretation that Paul used the word ‘baptized’ with a spiritual meaning, in which God’s Spirit is illustrated twice as water, that is like the water of baptism and like the pure water which we have drunk. (John 1:33; Acts 1:5) But according to another interpretation, Paul used the word ‘baptized’ here not to illustrate something that has happened spiritually but with the meaning of one’s physical body being baptized in water. According to this interpretation, this verse can be translated as follows: when we were baptized in water, God’s Spirit unified us. So there is no longer a problem if our members are Jews or non-Jews, slaves or free people. When we believe in Christ, that one Spirit already lives inside each of us, as if we all drank the same pure water.\f* into that one Holy Spirit, or as if we each drank pure water from the same cup. This means that this one Spirit has made all of us become like one body, which is the body of Christ.
\p
\v 14 For of course, the human body doesn’t consist of just one part but has many parts.
\v 15 If for example, the foot could be jealous and say, “I’m not a hand, so I’m not part of this body,” those words don’t change the situation, and that foot remains part of the body.
\v 16 In the same way, the ear could say, “I’m not an eye, so I’m not part of this body.” But what the ear said wouldn’t change the situation. That ear is still part of the body.
\v 17 If the whole body consisted of just an eye, the body couldn’t hear anything. And if the whole body consisted of just an ear, the body couldn’t smell anything.
\v 18-19 So if the whole body consisted of only one part, then it couldn’t be called a body any more. God is the one who arranges each part so that it functions in the body according to His will.
\v 20 So the body is one body, but it has many parts.
\p
\v 21 That’s why the eye can’t say to the hand, “I don’t need you.” And the head can’t say to the foot, “I don’t need you.”
\v 22-23 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem weak, or are considered less respectable, are actually very important and are always given special attention. So we protect the parts of the body that aren’t fit to be seen with clothing. In that way, the parts of the body that are considered less respectable are always given special attention.
\v 24 But the parts of our bodies which are considered more respectable don’t need special attention. In that way, God has unified the body, so that the parts which are considered weak and less respectable are given attention and special respect.
\v 25 So the body isn’t divided, but each of the parts pays attention to, and cares for each other.
\v 26 If one part of the body suffers, then all other parts of the body also suffer. Or if one part of the body is praised, all other parts of the body feel glad too.
\p
\v 27 We’re all the body of Christ, and each of you is a part of His body.
\v 28 And in the whole unity of Christ’s church, God has set it up as follows:
\q1 first are those who’ve been chosen as apostles,
\q1 second, are those chosen to deliver messages from God,
\q1 and third, are those chosen to teach.
\q1 Then there are some of us whom God chooses to do miracles.
\q1 And there are some who receive the special ability to heal sick people,
\q1 or help other people,
\q1 or become leaders,
\q1 or speak in different languages according to the Spirit's leading.
\m
\v 29 So not every member is chosen to become an apostle, or to deliver messages from God, or to teach. And not all of us can do miracles.
\v 30 Not all of us have the ability to heal sick people, or speak in different languages according to the Spirit's leading. And not everyone can translate what’s given in those languages of the Spirit.
\v 31 But you should all long to receive the abilities that are most important.
\s Loving is more important than all of the special abilities
\p And now I will show you the thing that is greater than all of those special abilities!
