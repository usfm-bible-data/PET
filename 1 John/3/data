\s We are God’s children
\p
\v 1 You should know that God’s love for us is so amazing that we’re called God’s children! And we are His children, of course. But people in this world can’t recognize our status as God’s children because they don’t know Christ.\f + \fr 3:1 \fk Christ \ft Literally, “Him”, which can also be interpreted as ‘God.’\f*
\v 2 Brothers and sisters whom I love, we’ve now become God’s children, but it isn’t clear what our state will be like later. However, we know that when Christ returns, we’ll become like Him, because we’ll see Him in His true state.
\v 3 Everyone who hopes to see Christ purifies, himself just like Christ is pure.
\p
\v 4 Everyone who sins breaks God’s Law, because sin means breaking God’s Law.
\v 5 And I want you to remember that Christ came to wipe out the sin of people, and there is no sin in Him.
\v 6 So everyone who is one with Christ won’t keep on sinning. Everyone who keeps on sinning has never actually understood about Christ, and has never known Him.
\p
\v 7 Because of that my children, whom I love, don’t let anyone deceive you that we who are one with Christ are allowed to commit sin. Christ lives rightly. And to become like Christ, we should do what is right.
\v 8 But the devil has been sinning from the beginning, and people who keep sinning belong to the devil. The reason that the Son of God came into this world was to destroy all the works of the devil.
\p
\v 9 Whoever has received new birth from God the Father has become a child of God! And each of His children can’t possibly keep on sinning, because the new life given to them by God is within them. Each of us who has received new birth from God can’t possibly keep sinning.
\v 10 In that way, the difference between we who are children of God and the children of the devil is obvious. The children of the devil don’t do what’s right and can’t possibly love us who have become God’s children.
\s We should love each other
\p
\v 11 This is the message that you’ve heard from the beginning: we should love each other.
\v 12 Let’s not be like Cain, who was the son of the devil, and killed his younger brother. And why did he kill his younger brother? Because Cain did what was evil, whereas his younger brother did what was right.
\p
\v 13 Brothers and sisters, let’s not be surprised when people in this world hate us.
\v 14 We’re no longer included with those whose lives are spiritually dead, \x + \xo 3:14 \xt Eph. 2:1-3; Col. 2:13-14\x* but are included with those who have been made spiritually alive. We know that, because we do love our brothers and sisters. If we don’t love our brothers and sisters, then we’re still spiritually dead.
\v 15 Everyone who hates his brother is actually a murderer. And we know for sure that a murderer hasn’t been made spiritually alive, so he doesn’t have eternal life.
\p
\v 16 We know the meaning of love by this, Christ loved us to the extent that He sacrificed His life for us. So we should also be willing to sacrifice for our brothers and sisters.
\v 17 If one of us has enough earthly possessions and sees his brother suffering in need, yet closes his heart’s door to his brother, the birth from God which enables us to love our fellowman isn’t in that person’s heart.
\v 18 So my beloved children, let’s not just claim that we love our fellowman with our mouths, but we should sincerely love our fellowman with visible deeds.
\p
\v 19-20 Now if we love our fellowman, it means that we may be certain that we’re living according to the true teachings from God, and this will help us when we come to God in prayer. Sometimes we still feel guilty. But if we obviously love our fellowman, we can calm our hearts with the awareness that God is greater than our hearts, and He knows everything.
\v 21 Brothers and sisters whom I love, if our hearts don’t feel guilty, we can come to God in prayer without feeling afraid,
\v 22 because it’s obvious that we obey His commands and do what pleases His heart. When we make a request to Him in that condition, we’ll receive answers to our prayers.
\v 23 And this is His command that I stress, we should believe in\f + \fr 3:23 \fk believe in \ft Literally, “believe in the name.” According to Jewish culture, at the time of Jesus ‘name’ meant the whole identity of Christ Jesus.\f* His Son Christ Jesus, and love each other, according to the command that Christ gave us.
\v 24 We who keep obeying God’s commands remain one with God, and God remains one with us. And we know that we’re still one with God if His Spirit which He gave us is still in us.
