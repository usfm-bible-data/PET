\s Do not follow false teaching
\p
\v 1 My beloved brothers and sisters, don’t quickly believe someone who claims that he has received his teaching or his prophecy from the Holy Spirit. But first you have to test his teaching or prophecy to know whether it’s really from the Holy Spirit, or from another spirit. For there are already many false teachers and false prophets in the world.
\v 2-3 This is the way to test if the Spirit of God is in someone. If a person admits, “I believe that Jesus is the Christ\f + \fr 4:2 \fk Christ \ft See the footnote about the position of the name Christ in 1 John 2:22.\f* who has come from God into this world as a human with a normal body,” it means the spirit in him comes from God. But if a person doesn’t admit that, it means the spirit that’s in him isn’t from God. That person is a messenger of the antichrist.\f + \fr 4:2 \fk antichrist \ft See the footnote about the antichrist in 1 John 2:18.\f* And you know that the antichrist is coming, and is already in this world.
\p
\v 4 So my beloved children, we come from God, and we’ve overcome those false teachers. For the Spirit that’s in us is greater than the spirit of the antichrist\f + \fr 4:4 \fk spirit of antichrist \ft Literally ‘spirit’. Besides 'antichrist', there are those who interpret that this points to the devil.\f* which is now already in this world.
\v 5 Those false teachers come from this world. And because of that, their teachings agree with the thinking of worldly people. So only worldly people listen to them.
\v 6 But we belong to God, so the people who know God listen to us, while those who don’t belong to God don’t listen to us. In that way, we can know if a person has the Spirit of Truth, which is God’s Spirit, or a spirit that leads astray.
\s Love is from God
\p
\v 7 My beloved Brothers and Sisters, let’s love each other. For love is from God, and everyone who loves has received new birth from God, and knows God.
\v 8 If someone doesn’t love his brother in the faith, it means he doesn’t know God, because God loves everyone.\f + \fr 4:8 \fk verse 8 \ft Literally, the Greek language writes, "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love." The TSI made the object explicit, according to the theme in this part (1 John 4:7-5:5). The words 'God is love' are an idiom in the Greek language. (Usually, if A=B, it means B=A. But the meaning of this idiom, is not 'love' is the same as 'God'.) The words 'God is love' speaks about a personal trait of God, just like these two phrases speak about God's nature: 'God is light' (1 John 1:5) and 'God is Spirit' (1 John 4:21).\f*
\v 9 And this is the way God showed His love to us: He sent His only Son into this world, in order that we could receive eternal life through His Son.
\v 10 So this extraordinary love is obvious. This extraordinary love wasn’t when we loved God, but when God showed His love to us, that is when God sent His Son to become the peace-making sacrifice, which wiped away our sin in God’s sight, so that God was no longer angry with us.
\p
\v 11 My beloved Brothers and Sisters, if God loves us so much, then we also have to love each other.
\v 12 No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives as one with us, and His love is perfectly obvious through us.
\p
\v 13 This is how we know if we live as one with God, and He lives as one with us: through His Spirit, which has been given to us.
\v 14 We ourselves, who saw and witnessed Jesus, testify to you that this is true. God the Father has sent His Son to become the King of Salvation for mankind in this world!
\v 15 If anyone admits, “I believe that Jesus is the Son of God,” then God is one with him and he is one with God.
\v 16 So we know and believe the love of God for us.
\p God loves all mankind. And if we keep on loving our brothers and sisters in the faith, it means we remain one with God, and God is one with us.
\v 17 When we live as one with God, then the love of God is more perfectly obvious among us. For that reason, we aren’t afraid of the Judgment Day, because it’s proven that we live in this world just like Christ lived.
\v 18 If that love from God is in our hearts, it means that we won’t fear God’s punishment anymore, because that perfect love wipes out fear. Whoever is still afraid to be judged by God, still considers that he deserves to be punished. So the person who is afraid like that hasn’t yet experienced God’s perfect love.
\p
\v 19 We should love each other, because God loved us first.
\v 20 If someone says, “I love God” but still hates his brother, he is a deceiver. The person who doesn’t love his brother, who is visible, can’t possibly love God, who is invisible.
\v 21 And of course, God has given this commandment to us: whoever loves God has to love his brother also.
