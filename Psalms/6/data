\v 5 (6) Because a person who has died will not remember You,
\q2 and people who have entered into the pit of the grave\f + \fr 6: 5 \fk pit of the grave \ft Literally, the Hebrew says/writes ‘Syeol’. (In English, 'Sheol'.) Throughout the OT times, the Israelites imagined Sheol as a storage place for the souls of the dead, which was dark and where there is no joy. Its location was thought of as under the earth and far from God in heaven. Sometimes in OT poetry, the door to Sheol is said to lie on the deepest ocean floor. So Sheol is not identical with paradise, heaven, or hell. The word Sheol is often translated in a more generic way as ‘death’ or ‘pit of the grave’.\f* no longer praise You.
