\c 2
\q1
\v 1-2 How useless it is for the tribes and nations to oppose the Lord!
\q2 It is just useless that all the kings and rulers agree to rebel
\q2 against the Almighty and his anointed King!
\q1
\v 3 The rulers and the king shout, “Let us be free/independent from god and the king\f + \fr 2:3 \fk god and the king \ft Because these rulers and kings do not believe in God and His anointed King, their quotation does not use capital letters [for deity].\f* which he chose!
\q2 Let's not submit anymore to their orders!”
\b
\q1
\v 4 But in heaven where He sits enthroned, the LORD laughs as He [makes fun of//reviles] them.
\q2
\v 5 Then He will scare them when in his powerful wrath He says,
\q2
\v 6 “I have chosen and [crowned//formally installed] a King over you—
\q2 that is the One who is enthroned in Jerusalem,\f + \fr 2: 6 \fk Jerusalem \ft Literally, ‘Zion’.\f* My holy mountain.”
\b
\q1
\v 7 This is what the anointed King says:
\q2 “Let everyone know the covenant of the LORD to me—
\q3 ‘My [Son//Child], today I declare that I am Your Father,
\q3 and You are My Son.\f + \fr 2: 7 \fk My Son \ft This word uses the Hebrew term for an adopted son. In that culture, the adopted son is entitled to inherit as a biological son. In the Old Testament, every king of David's descendants was also called a son of God (2Sam. 7:14; Ps. 89:26-27). Those kings became a [picture/figure] of the chief Descent of David— who is Christ Jesus. He also became the Son of God not because of birth, but by the declaration of God in this verse.\f*
\q3
\v 8 Ask me for any inheritance whatsoever, and I certaily will give it.
\q3 Every nation— even those who are at the ends of the earth, will be Your possessions!
\q3
\v 9 No one can oppose the rule of Your government,
\q3 because your power can be pictured as like an iron rod
\q3 that easily breaks clay vessels.’”
\b
\q1
\v 10 Therefore, all you kings and rulers of the world,
\q2 be aware of this and act wisely!
\q1
\v 11 Repent and serve the LORD with full respect and fear \f + \fr 2:11 \fk fear \ft The Hebrew word translated here as fear, is more often translated ‘rejoice’. In this context, it is better to translate in the sense of ‘fear’.\f* of Him!
\q1
\v 12 Put down your feet at the feet of His Son.
\q2 And completely submit fully,
\q2 so that his Son will not be angry and destroy you!
\q1or His Son's anger is like a roaring fire,
\q2 but very blessed is everyone who takes refuge in that Son of His!
