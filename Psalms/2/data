\s1 The King annointed by the LORD\f + \fr 2:1 \fk King annointed … \ft Evidently King David was not just a psalmist who wrote poems, but was also a prophet. This psalm is the first psalm with messianic characteristics. This means that the theme of this psalm speaks of the King of Salvation, the descendant of David, who was promised to rule overall tribes and nations forever.\f*
\b
\q1
\v 1-2 How useless it is for the tribes and nations to oppose the Lord!
\q2 It is just useless that all the kings and rulers agree to rebel
\q2 against the Almighty and his anointed King!
\q1
\v 3 The rulers and the king shout, “Let us be free/independent from god and the king\f + \fr 2:3 \fk god and the king \ft Because these rulers and kings do not believe in God and His anointed King, their quotation does not use capital letters [for deity].\f* which he chose!
\q2 Let's not submit anymore to their orders!”
\b
\q1
\v 4 But in heaven where He sits enthroned, the LORD laughs as He [makes fun of//reviles] them.
\q2
\v 5 Then He scare them in his powerful wrath when He says,
\q2
\v 6 “I have chosen and [crowned//formally installed] a King over you—
\q2 that is the One who is enthroned in Jerusalem,\f + \fr 2:6 \fk Jerusalem \ft Literally, ‘Zion’. The TSI uses Jerusalem because that name is more recognized than Zion. But Zion is the name of Mount Zion— which is the place that Abraham offered up Isaac, and where God's House was built by Solomon. (Gen. 22:2, 14; 2Chr. 3:1)\f* My holy mountain.”
\b
\q1
\v 7 This is what the anointed King says:
\q2 “Let everyone know the promise of the LORD to me—
\q3 ‘My Child/Son, today I declare that I am Your Father,
\q3 and You are My Son/Child.\f + \fr 2: 7 \fk The LORD announces the identity of His Son \ft In this verse God's Son reveals the proclamation of God the Father about his Son. God's proclamation is similar with formal announcements for the adoption of a child in all Middle Eastern culture. In that culture, the adopted son is entitled to inherit an inheritance like a biological son. In the Old Testament, every king of David's descendants was also called a son of God (2Sam. 7:14; Ps. 89:26-27). Those kings became a picture of the chief Descent of David— who is Christ Jesus. He didn't become the Son of God by birth, but by God's announcement in this verse. For more information, see the footnote in the NET.\f*
\q3
\v 8 Ask me for any inheritance whatsoever, and I certaily will give it.
\q3 Every nation— even those who are at the ends of the earth, will be Your possessions!
\q3
\v 9 No one can oppose the rule of Your government,
\q3 because your power can be pictured as like an iron rod
\q3 that easily breaks clay vessels.’”
\b
\q1
\v 10 Therefore, all you kings and rulers of the world,
\q2 be aware of this and act wisely!
\q1
\v 11 Repent and serve the LORD with full respect and fear \f + \fr 2:11 \fk fear \ft The Hebrew word translated here as fear, is more often translated ‘rejoice’. In this context, it is better to translate in the sense of ‘fear’.\f* of Him!
\q1
\v 12 Kneel and lower yourself at the feet of His Son.
\q2 And completely submit fully,
\q2 so that his Son will not be angry and destroy you!
\q1 For the anger of that Son of His is like a roaring fire.
\q2 But very blessed is everyone who takes refuge in that Son of His!
