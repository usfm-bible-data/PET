\c 23
\s1 The life of someone shepherded by the LORD
\d (1) A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, I am like Your sheep, and You are my shepherd.
\q2 Because of that, I lack nothing at all.
\q1
\v 2 You provide a comfortable place for me to calmly rest—
\q2 like a shepherd who leads his flock of sheep into a green meadow and to a calm stream of water.
\q1
\v 3 You give new strength to me.
\q1 You lead me in the way that pleases You,
\q2 so that my life will always glorify You.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Even though I walk through a dark and dangerous place,
\q1 I will not be afraid of anything
\q2 because you are always with me.
\q1 And I am more confident in Your presence (with me)
\q2 because You use your two sticks to protect and correct my way of life.\f + \fr 23:4 \fk your two sticks \ft Two kinds of sticks are mentioned here— specifically the ‘syebet’ (rod) and the ‘misyaina’ (staff). The first is a stick for striking, which can be used to protect oneself from attacks of wild beasts or bad people. The second is a longer stick, which is used to help the shepherd walk in places where the road is not flat. This kind of stick is often pictured as having a hook at the top, which can be used to pull a sheep from a dangerous path, yang dapat digunakan untuk menarik domba dari jalan berbahaya. Jadi kedua macam tongkat menggambarkan bahwa Gembala kita siap untuk membela kita dan juga memperbaiki kita.\f*
\b
\q1
\v 5 Before all my enemies You receive me as an honored guest.
\q2 You anoint my head as a sign that You honor me,
\q2 then You serve me with food and drinks in abundance.
\q1
\v 6 My LORD, as long as I live,
\q2 I am sure You will continually be good and faithful to me,
\q1 and forever I will stay with You in your House!
