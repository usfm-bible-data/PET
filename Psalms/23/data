\c 23
\d (1) A psalm written by David
\q1
\v 1 O Lord, I am like Your sheep, and You are my shepherd.
\q2 That's why I don't lack anything.
\q1
\v 2 You provide a comfortable place for me to [calmly rest//rest in peace]â€”
\q2 like a shepherd who leads his flock of sheep into a green meadow and to a calm stream of water.
\q1
\v 3 You give new strength to me.
\q1 You lead me in the way that pleases You,
\q2 so that my life will always glorify You.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Even though I walk through a dark and dangerous place,
\q1 I'm not afraid of anything,
\q2 because you are always with me.
\q1 And I am more confident in Your presence (with me)
\q2 because You use your two sticks to protect and correct my way of life.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Before all my enemies You give abundant blessings to me.
\q2 You welcome me with an anointing as a sign of appreciation,
\q2 then serve me with food and drinks.
\q1
\v 6 My LORD, as long as I live,
\q2 I am sure You will continually be kind and generous to me,
\q1 and I will stay with You forever in Your Home!
