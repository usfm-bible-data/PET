\c 5
\s1 A prayer asking for protection from enemies
\s2 (1) This Psalm was written by David and directed to the choir deader, to be accompanied by flute.
\q1
\v 1 (2) Oh LORD, hear my prayer!
\q2 Take notice of my sighing complaints.
\q1
\v 2 (3) Hear my cry/shout asking for help,
\q2 because it is to You that I pray, oh my God and King!
\q1
\v 3 (4) Every morning I pray to You convey all my requests.\f + \fr 5:3 \fk convey all my requests \ft Literally, ‘I arrange/organize for You’. In Hebrew, what is being arranged or ordered is not clear. Because of that there are several translations that give the meaning of ‘sacrifices’ or ‘offerings’. But that can also be interpreted as ‘requests’, so that verses 1-3 continue in the context of prayer.\f*
\q2 I wait [with anticipation (reduplication)] for Your reply!
\b
\q1
\v 4 (5) You are a God who does not like people who do evil (things).
\q2 You will never allow them to enter into your presence.
\q1
\v 5 (6) You [do not favor/are not pleased with] conceited people.
\q2 You hate all those who do evil.
\q1
\v 6 (7) Yes/Oh, You will destroy every liar,
\q2 and consider revolting the people who kill their fellow (man/person), and all habitual liars.
\b
\q1
\v 7 (8) Because of the greatness of Your generosity/good-heartedness, I may come to Your House.
\q2 With fear and respect I bow at the House of the LORD and worship You.
\q1
\v 8 (9) O Lord, my enemies are looking for opportunities to harm me,
\q2 lead me so that I live rightly according to Your will.
\q2 Reveal the path You want me to follow.
\b
\q1
\v 9 (10) But everything that is said by my enemies is lies!
\q2 They always desire to destroy other people.
\q1 Their sweet words hide cunning intentions,
\q2 and their words lead to death!\f + \fr 5: 9 \fk words ... \ft Literally,“Their throats are like a grave pit."\f*
\q1
\v 10 (11) O Allah, judge them according to their deeds!
\q2 Let the evil they plan to happen to someone else fall on themselves.
\q2 Because their sins are so many they [like to/habitually] rebell against You,
\q2 drive them away from [before You/Your presence].
\b
\q1
\v 11 (12) But may those who take shelter in You rejoice!
\q2 May they joyfully [shout//cheer] forever!
\q1 Protect them,
\q2 so that those who are faithful to You will praise You with full rejoicing.\f + \fr 5:11 \fk You \ft Literally, ‘rejoice in your name’. The LORD’s name is used as a figure of speech that points to all of God's person.\f*
\q1
\v 12 (13) O Lord, you will bless every person who lives rightly,
\q2 and You are like a shield which protects them always!
