\c 5
\s1 A prayer asking for protection from enemies
\s2 (1) This Psalm was written by David and directed to the choir deader, to be accompanied by flute.
\q1
\v 1 (2) Oh LORD, hear my prayer!
\q2 Take notice of my sighing complaints.
\q1
\v 2 (3) Hear the moment I call out to You, oh God,
\q2 because it is only to You that I pray, oh my King!
\q1
\v 3 (4) Every morning, oh LORD, You hear my requests.
\q2 then I wait [with anticipation (reduplication)] for Your reply!
\b
\q1
\v 4 (5) You hate all kinds of evil,
\q2 and there is no way evil people are allowed to approach You.
\q1
\v 5 (6) Conceited people are not able to request something in your presence,
\q2 because You hate all those who do evil.
\q1
\v 6 (7) It is You, oh LORD, who desroys every liar,
\q2 and hate all murderers and deceivers.
\b
\q1
\v 7 (8) Because of Your abundant love, I may come to Your House.
\q2 With fear and respect I bow at the House of the LORD and worship You.
\q1
\v 8 (9) O Lord, my enemies look for ways to harm me,
\q2 lead me so that I live rightly according to Your will.
\q2 Reveal the path You want me to follow.
\b
\q1
\v 9 (10) But all that my enemies say are lies!
\q2 They always desire to destroy someone else.
\q1 Their sweet words hide cunning intentions,
\q2 and their words lead to death!\f + \fr 5: 9 \fk words ... \ft Literally,“Their throat is like a grave pit."\f*
\q1
\v 10 (11) O Allah, judge the based on their deeds!
\q2 Let the evil they plan to happen to someone else fall on themselves.
\q2 Because of sinning so much, drive them away from before You,
\q2 for they [like to//habitually] rebell against You.
\b
\q1
\v 11 (12) But may those who take shelter in You rejoice!
\q2 May they joyfully [shout//cheer] forever!
\q1 Protect them,
\q2 so that those who are faithful to You may rejoice in You.\f + \fr 5:11 \fk You \ft Liter Literally, ‘your name’. The LORD’s name is used as a figure of speech that points to all of God's person.\f*
\q1
\v 12 (13) O Lord, you will bless every person who lives rightly,
\q2 and You are like a shield which protects them always!
