\s1 Jonah's prayer
\p
\v 1-2 From within the fish's stomach, Jonah prayed to his God. He said,
\q1 “Oh LORD, as the writer of Psalms said,\f + \fr 2:1 \fk seperti penulis Mazmur berkata \ft Many people have asked why— if according to verses 1 and 10 he is still in the belly of the big fish— he prays as if he is saved from deadly danger? One good answer is that he is quoting from the experiences of the writer of the Psalms. Although Jonah's prayer doesn't quote exactly like verses in the Psalms, there are similarities with phrases in Ps. 2:9; 3:8; 18:4-6; 22:22-28; 32:5; 42:5-8; 50:13-17; 66:13-15; 69:1-2, 5-6, 13-15; 116:3-5. To see further information, see the article by Bob Deffinbaugh, “The Psalm of the Prodigal Prophet.”\f* I am in big trouble!
\q2 I cried to You for help, and You answered me.
\q1 When I was far away and as if already in the grave,
\q2 I cried to You,
\q2 and You heard my cry and saved me.
\q1
\v 3 You threw me into the middle of the deepest ocean.
\q2 There the flow of water surrounded me.
\q2 The waves and billows tossed me here and there.
\p
\q1
\v 4 I think You have driven me far from Your presence,
\q2 and how can ever again I see your holy House in Jerusalem?\f + \fr 2:4 \fk line 4b \ft This line can be translated as a statement of Jonah’s confidence, “still I am sure that I will again see your holy House.”\f*
\q1
\v 5 The wide ocean covered my whole body!
\q2 The ocean water drowned me,
\q2 and it was as if the seaweed wrapped around my head.
\q1
\v 6 I sank to the deepest ocean floor.
\q2 It was as if the gate of the world of the dead was locked and I was imprisoned there forever.
\q2 But You, oh LORD, you saved me from the hole of my grave and gave me my life back. \f \fr 2:6 \fk Verse 6 \ft Jonah felt that he himself had practically died. Obviously he was still alive in the stomach of the fish, and he prayed requesting merecy from the LORD. The LORD heard Jonah's prayer and saved his life.\f*
\p
\q1
\v 7 When I was at the threshold of death, You remembered me,
\q2 and my prayer reached to You, in Your holy House.
\p
\q1
\v 8 It's pointless when people worship false gods,
\q2 because they forsake You who love them with faithfulness.
\q1
\v 9 But I will sing praise and offer a sacrifice to You.
\q2 I will keep all my promises, oh LORD my Savior.’”
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD ordered the fish to vomit Jonah onto the land.
