\c 4
\s1 Jonah is mad because of God's kindness to Nineveh's residents
\p
\v 1 Jonah was offended and very angry because God didn't destroy Nineveh.
\v 2 This is how Jonah prayed to the LORD, "Oh LORD, before when I was still in my country I figured that You would do like this! That's why I ran away to Tarshish. You are All Loving, merciful, and very patient. When people do evil, You aren't quickly angry and always are ready to change your plan to (not) punish them.
\v 3 So, now oh LORD, because You it didn't happen to destroy Niniveh, let me die, because it's better that I die than live."
\p
\v 4 Then the LORD said, "Is it proper for you to be mad because I didn't destroy Niniveh?"
\p
\v 5 Then Jonah went to the east side of the city and built a small hut there, then sat in the shelter under it while waiting and watching for what would happen to that city.
\v 6 Then the LORD God caused a plant to grow that spread to protect Jonah's head from the sun's rays to make him feel more comfortable. Jonah was very happy with that plant.
\v 7 However the next day before the sun rose, God sent a worm to make a hole in the stalk of that plant so that it made it wilt.
\v 8 When the sun rose, God sent a wind that was very hot to blow from the east. Because the sun was very hot, then Jonah became weak and almost fainted. Jonah wanted to die and cried out, "It's better for me to die than live!"
\p
\v 9 So God answered Jonah, "Is it proper for you to be mad because of that wilted plant?"
\p Jonah answered, "Yes, it's proper for me to be mad enough to die!"
\p
\v 10 But the LORD said to him, "You yourself care about that spreading plant, right? However you didn't do anything to plant or care for what grew in just one night and then wilted the next night.
\v 11 How can I not pity Nineveh, that great city with more than one hundred twenty thousand resident's lives?!  They are still very immature spiritually and can't yet differentiate what is good and evil. And there are also many animals there."
