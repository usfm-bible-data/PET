\s Repentance of Nineveh's residents
\p
\v 1 For the second time the LORD spoke to Jonah,
\v 2 "Go to Nineveh, that great city, and tell the residents the message that I give you."
\v 3 This time Jonah obeyed the LORD's command to go there. The city of Nineveh was very big because itu took three days time for a person to walk across the city.
\p
\v 4 Jonah entered the city and after walking the whole day, he began to preach, saying, "Forty more days, Nineveh will be destroyed!"
\v 5 The residents of Niniveh believed the message of God that was delivered by Jonah. They decided to fastâ€” both great and small people, wearing sackcloth to show that they regretted their sins.
\p
\v 6 After the king of Nineveh heard that news, he immediately got down from his throne. He took off his royal robe and wore sackcloth, then he sat on ashes as a sign he regretted his sin.
\v 7 Then the King and the ministers put out a command to be announced to all the residents of Nineveh like this,
\pi "Every person, cow, sheep and other flocks are forbidden to eat or drink.
\v 8 Every person and animal has to wear sackcloth. As a sign of regret they have to pray genuinely to God and have to repent of their deeds and evil actions.
\v 9 Who knows? Maybe in that way God will change His decision and His wrath will subside so that we won't be destroyed."
\p
\v 10 When God saw Ninevah's residents' genuine regret and no longer doing evil deeds, then God stopped being angry toward the city of Nineveh and cancelled His decision to destroy them.
