\s1 Jonah rejects the LORD's command to go warn the residents of the city of Nineveh
\v 1 In the past, there was a prophet in Israel named Jonah. His father was named Amitai. The LORD gave this command to him,
\v 2 "God and warn the residents of the great capitol city Ninevah\f + \fr 1:2 \fk Niniveh \ft Niniveh was the capitol city of Asyria, a people group that were godless, cruel and unethical. (Nah.1:11; 2:12-13; 3:1,4,16,19). The Jews hated the Asyrians and viewed them as a threat. Jonah was very angry because the residents of Nineveh weren't descendants of Jewish people. Jonah hoped that the Lord wouldn't pity them.\f* that I will soon punish them, because their deeds are very evil."
\p
\v 3 But Jonah didn't go to Nineveh! Instead he ran away to Joppaâ€” a place in the opposite direction of the LORD's command. There, he found a ship that was headed to the city of Tarshish, paid the fare for the trip mentioned, and got on the ship.
\v 4 Then the LORD sent a very strong wind on the ocean and caused a storm that was huge and strong, so that the ship almost broke up.
\v 5 Because of that, the ship's sailors were so afraid and everyone prayed to his god to ask for help. They threw the cargo into the ocean to lighten the ship's load so that it wouldn't easily sink. At the same time, Jonah had gone down to the lowest level, then lay there, until he was sound asleep.
\v 6 When the ship's captain went down to the lowest level, he saw Jonah was sleeping soundly. Then the ship's captain woke up Jonah ans said, "How can you possibly sleep soundly in this situation? Get up, pray to your god! Maybe your god will have pity and save us from this disaster.
\p
\v 7 After the ship's captain and Jonah went up to the ship's top level, the ship's sailors said to one another, "In order to find out who actually caused this disaster, we will cast lots." \f + \fr 1:7 \fk lots \ft Lots were used to determine or choose (as to determine who had a certain right, who was first, etc.).\f* Then they cast lots, and Jonah was the one who was picked.
\v 8 The ship's sailors said to Jonah, "Is it true that you are the cause of this disaster?" What's your job? Where are you from and what's your people group?"
\p
\v 9-10 Jonah answered, "I'm a Hebrew. I worship the LORD who is on the throne of heaven and who created the sea and land. I am trying to run away from His command."
\p After hearing what was told by Jonah, then the ship's sailors became very afraid. Then they said to him, "What? So why did you do that?"
\p
\v 11 At the same time, the storm got worse and the waves got bigger. The ship's sailors said to Jonah, "What do we need to do to you so that this storm can calm back down?"
\p
\v 12 Jonah answered, "Pick me up and throw me into the ocean, then the storm will certainly be calm again. I understand now that I caused this storm."
\p
\v 13 But the ship's sailors didn't want to immediately throw Jonah into the ocean. They tried as hard as they could to row the ship back to land. However they weren't able to because the storm got bigger and attacked them.
\v 14 Because of that, they just cried out to the LORD, "Oh LORD, don't destroy us because of the life of this person, who didn't do any wrong at all to us. Oh LORD< You do whatever You desire!"
\v 15 Then they picked up Jonah and threw him into the ocean, and the ocean became calm again.
\v 16 The ship's sailors became afraid of the LORD's great authority. Because of that, they promised that later they would do things that please His heart and would offer a slaughtered sacrifice.
\p
\v 17 At the same time, the LORD brought a large fish to swallow Jonah. So Jonah stayed in the fish's stomach as long as three days and three nights.
