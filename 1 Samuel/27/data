\c 27
\s David forced to ally with the Philistines
\p
\v 1 Then David thought, â€œOne day, if I am still in this area, Saul will kill me. I'd better flee to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will stop chasing me throughout Israel, and I will be released from his hand."
\p
\v 2-3 So David and his six hundred soldiers and their respective families moved to the city of Gath in the land of the Philistines. They asked the king of Gath, Achish son of Maoch, to take refuge in his area. David brought his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, and Abigail the Carmelite, the widow of Nabal.
\v 4 When Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, he stopped chasing David.
\p
\v 5 David said to Achish, "If my Lord is pleased, please give a piece of land to your servant in a small town, so that I can move and live there. We will trouble my lord the king if we stay in this royal city."
\p
\v 6 So on that day King Achish gave the village of Ziklag to David. That is why it is an inheritance for the kings of Judah to this day.
\v 7 David lived in the country of the Philistines for one year and four months.
\p
\v 8 So David and his army raided and plundered the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. The territories of these three indigenous tribes began at the southern border of the Philistine region, and all the way across the wilderness of Shur to the land of Egypt.
\v 9 Every time David attacked an area, David did not leave a single person alive, either male or female. He plundered all the herd, livestock, donkeys, camels and clothing. Then when he returned to Philistine territory, he always reported to Achish.
\p
\v 10 If Achish asked, "Where did you plunder this time?"
\p David would answer, "In the southern region of the tribe of Judah," or, "In the southern part of the tribe of Jerahmeel," or "In the southern part of the Kenites."
\p
\v 11 That is what David did while he was living in the land of the Philistines. There is not a single male or female that he let live. For David thought, "If anyone was saved, they would report us and say, 'This is what David did to us.'"
\v 12 So Achish believed David, because Achish thought, "David really made himself hated by his fellow Israelites! Surely he will be my servant forever."
