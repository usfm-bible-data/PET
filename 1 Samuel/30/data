\s David defeats the Amalekites
\p
\v 1 After David and his troops left Achish’s army, they traveled two full days and arrived at the village of Ziklag on the third day. But a day or two before they arrived, the Amalekites had already plundered the southern region. They had already attacked Ziklag and burned it down.
\v 2 They also took the women of Ziklag into captivity, from the youngest to the oldest. No one was killed but they took everyone prisoners.
\v 3 When David and his troops arrived, they found their village on fire. Their wives, sons and daughters were taken prisoners.
\v 4 So David and his soldiers wept with a loud voice, and kept on crying until they could no longer cry.
\v 5 The two wives of David, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail the Carmelite (ex-wife of Nabal), were also taken prisoner.
\v 6 But the situation immediately became dangerous for David, because his troops were so angry and grieved at the loss of their family that some of them began to threaten to stone David. But David still believed in the LORD who gives him strength.
\p
\v 7 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here." So Abiathar brought it,
\v 8 and David asked the LORD, "Should I go after these looters? Will I succeed in catching up with them?" The Lord answered him, "Pursue them, for you will certainly catch up with them and save the captives."
\p
\v 9 So David and his six hundred soldiers pursued the plunderers. When they came to the bank of the Besor River,
\v 10 two hundred men were too tired to cross the river. David decided they should stay there. Then David and the four hundred other men pursued the plunderers.
\p
\v 11 On their way, David's troops found an Egyptian in a field, and brought him to David. They gave him food and drink,
\v 12 a slice of fig cake and two packets of raisins, for this man had not eaten or drunk for three days and three nights. After eating and drinking his strength recovered.
\p
\v 13 David asked the man, "Where are you from and who is your master?"
\p Then he replied, "I am Egyptian. I am the slave of an Amalekite. Three days ago my master left me because I was too sick to walk.
\v 14 We plundered the southern part of Judah, where the Kerethites live, and other parts of Judah, and then in the southern part of the City of Hebron, where the people of Caleb's descendants live. Lastly we also burned Ziklag."
\p
\v 15 David said to him, "Can you lead us to the looters?"
\p The man said, "I can, but swear to God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, then I will take you to them."
\p
\v 16 David agreed, so the Egyptian brought David and his army to the place where the Amalekites were. They were scattered everywhere and were feasting on food and drink because they got a lot of loot from the Philistine and Judean regions.
\v 17 From the beginning of the night until the evening came again, David and his army slaughtered them. None of them escaped, except for four hundred who managed to escape on camels.
\v 18 David took back all that had been taken by the Amalekites, including saving his two wives.
\v 19 David and his troops retrieved everything that was taken, including all family members and booty. Then they started bringing everything back to Ziklag.
\v 20 They gathered up all the flock and livestock and brought them before the whole company. Some rejoiced saying, "This is David's booty!"
\p
\v 21 Then David came to the River Besor, where the two hundred men of his army who were too tired to continue chasing the looters were still waiting there. When they came out to greet David and the whole group, David greeted them with joy.
\v 22 But several wicked persons and troublemakers in David's army said, “Since these two hundred men were not with us, we will not share this spoil with them. They can only take their wives and children and leave!”
\p
\v 23 But David said to them, “No! Realize that all these things are gifts from the LORD! He has already protected us and placed our enemy in our hands.
\v 24 No one will agree with what you said earlier! Both our members who participated in the battle, and those who were left to guard the supplies, will have an equal share of the loot."
\v 25 David even made this decision into law for the nation of Israel which is still in effect today.
\p
\v 26 When David arrived at Ziklag, David sent part of the spoil to the elders of Judah, that is, to his friends who had supported him. He gave a message to them, "These are gifts for you that we took from the enemies of the LORD!"
\p
\v 27 This is a list of the cities and territories where the inhabitants received gifts from David:
\li2 Bethel, Ramoth in the southern wilderness, and several cities in the region of Jattir.
\li2
\v 28 Gifts were also sent to the cities of Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa,
\li2
\v 29 Racal, and several cities in the area of the Jerahmeel and Kenite tribes.
\li2
\v 30 Gifts were also sent to the cities of Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach,
\li2
\v 31 and Hebron,
\li2 and to several other areas that David had visited with his troops.
