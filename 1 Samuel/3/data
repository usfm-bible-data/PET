\s1 The LORD raises Samuel up to become His prophet
\p
\v 1 Samuel continued serving the LORD with Priest Eli's guidance. The word of the LORD was seldom delivered at that time, and visions also seldom happened.
\v 2 One night Eli lay in his bed, Eli's two eyes were shortsighted because he had already lived long.
\v 3 As the day approached dawn, the large seven branched candle holder in the LORD's house was not yet extinguished.\f + \fk extinguished \ft obviously little Samuel became the guard so that the large seven branched candle holder in the LORD's house didn't die in the night and burned continuously until dawn approached, according to Moses' regulation from Ex. 27:21\f* Samuel was lying near the chest of promise of the LORD, in the Holy House of the LORD.
\v 4 The LORD called Samuel, and he answered, "I'm here!"
\v 5 Then he approached Eli and said, "I'm here, did Father call me?" But Eli answered, "I didn't call you. Go back and lie down. Then Samuel returned to lying.
\p
\v 6-7 And the LORD called again, "Samuel!" Samuel didn't know that who called him was the LORD because the LORD had never yet talked to him. So he got up, went to approach Eli and said, "Father called me? This is me." But Eli answered Samuel, "Child, I didn't call you, go back to sleep."
\v 8 Then the LORD called Samuel a third time. So he got up and met Eli and said, "I'm here, Father called me!" Then Eli was aware that the LORD was the one who had called Samuel.
\v 9 So Eli said to Samuel, "Lie down again in your place and sleep. If you hear the voice call you again, say, 'Speak oh LORD, your servant is listening.' Then Samuel went back and slept in his place.
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD came and stood near him, calling Samuel like before, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel answered, "Speak oh LORD, because Your servant is listening!"
\p
\v 11 The LORD spoke to Samuel, "Listen! I will do something great among the people of Israel and when they hear this news, they will be shocked and feel horrified and won't want to believe it.
\v 12 On that day I will fulfill everything that I have said about Eli's family! Not one thing will not happen!
\v 13 You have to tell Eli that I will bring judgement on his family forever because of the sins of Hophni and Phinehas that are known by him. Because Hophni and Phinehas do deeds that blaspheme God, and Eli doesn't stop or rebuke them harshly.
\v 14 Thats why I swore regarding Eli's family, 'The sin of Eli's family will not be forgiven \f + \fr 3:14 \fk will not be forgiven \ft According to Moses regulation in Ex. 17:12, Ex. 21:18-21, Lev. 24:11-16, Lev. 24:23, the punishment for people who look down on the priest's service, don't respect their parents and also blasphemy is the death penalty.\f* both with offering burned sacrifices or food offerings.'"
\v 15 So Samuel slept again until morning. Then he opened the door of the LORD"s house, but Samuel was afraid to tell Eli regarding that vision.
\v 16 However Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my child!" He answered, "I'm coming."
\p
\v 17 Eli asked, "What message did the LORD deliver to you? Don't hide it from me. God will punish you harshly if you hide anything that was spoken by Him to you!"
\v 18 So Samuel told Eli everything. He didn't hide anything from Eli. Eli said, "The LORD will do according to His will."
\p
\v 19 Samule continued to grow big, and the LORD was with him. The LORD fulfilled every word that was delivered by Him through Samuel.
\v 20 All of the Israelites who stayed in the area of Dan to Beersheba were aware that the LORD truly gave ability as a prophet of the LORD to Samuel.
\v 21 Then the LORD again revealed himself in Shiloh, because in that place the LORD declared himself to Samuel through the word of the LORD.
