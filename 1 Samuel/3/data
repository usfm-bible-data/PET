\s1 The LORD raises Samuel up to become His prophet
\p
\v 1 Samuel continued serving the LORD with Priest Eli's guidance. At that time, rarely there was prophet that delivered message from the LORD , and visions also seldom happened.
\v 2  Eli's two eyes were myopic because he had already continued age, one night Eli lay in his bed,
\v 3 and the lampstand branched in the tent of the LORD still burning, \f + \fk extinguished \ft obviously little Samuel became the guard so that the large seven branched candle holder in the LORD's house didn't die in the night and burned continuously until dawn approached, according to Moses' regulation from Ex. 27:21\f* Samuel was lying near the Holy Room  not so far from the Most holy Room and the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
\v 4 Suddenly the LORD called Samuel,
\p and Samuel answered, "I'm here!"
\v 5 Then he came to  Eli and said, "I'm here, Sir call me earlier."
\p But Eli answered, "I didn't call you. Go back and lie down. Then Samuel returned to lying.
\p
\v 6-7 And the LORD called again, "Samuel!"
\p Samuel didn't know that who called him was the LORD because the LORD had never yet spoke to him before. Then he got up, went to approach Eli and said, "Sir called me. This is me."
\p But Eli answered Samuel, "Son, I didn't call you, go back to sleep."
\p
\v 8 Then the LORD called Samuel a third time. So he got up and once again came to Eli and said, "I'm here, Sir called me!" Then Eli  realized that the LORD was the one who had called Samuel.
\v 9 So Eli said to Samuel, "Lie down again in your place and sleep. If you hear that voice call you again, say, 'Speak oh LORD, your servant is listening.' Then Samuel went back and slept in his place.
\p
\v 10 Then the LORD came and stood near him, calling Samuel like before, "Samuel! Samuel!" 
\p And Samuel answered, "Speak oh LORD, because Your servant is listening!"
\p
\v 11 The LORD spoke to him, "Listen! I will do something great among the people of Israel and when they hear this news, they will be shocked and feel horrified and hope that the news isn't true.
\v 12 On that day I will do all punishment that I have said against Eli and his family! Not one thing will not happen!
\v 13 I already repeatedly times warn Eli that I  will punish his family forever because of  their sins. the behavior of Hophni and Phinehas insulted Me, but  Eli doesn't take action to stop their behavior.
\v 14 Thats why I swore regarding Eli's family, 'The sin of Eli's family will never be forgiven \f + \fr 3:14 \fk will never be forgiven \ft According to Moses regulation in Ex. 17:12, Ex. 21:18-21, Lev. 24:11-16, Lev. 24:23, the punishment for people who look down on the priest's ministry, don't respect their parents and also blasphemy is the death penalty.\f* even tahy offer  burned sacrifices or food offerings.'"
\p
\v 15 So Samuel slept again until morning. Then like usual he opened the curtain of the LORD"s tent. Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the message that the LORD told.
\v 16 However Eli called him "Samuel, my child!" 
\p He answered, " Yes, Sir. I'm here."
\p
\v 17 Then Eli asked him, "What is the message that the LORD told you? Don't hide it from me! Let God punish you, even take your life,  if you hide anything that He told you!"
\v 18 So Samuel told him everything. He didn't hide anything. Finally Eli said, "Let the LORD do according to His will."
\p
\v 19 Samuel continued to grow big, and the LORD was with him. All prophecy that Samuel said always happened.
\v 20 Because of that all  people from the tip of the north of  Israel until to the tip of the south, which is from the region  of Dan to Beersheba, acknowledge  that  Samuel was proven as prophet of the LORD.
\v 21 And the LORD still continued to  reveal Himself  and telling many messages to Samuel in Shiloh. Then Samuel  report that things to the people of Israel. (4:1) So things that prophesied by Samuel was jeard in all Israel.
