\s1 Samuel's parting words
\p
\v 1 Samuel said to all the people of Israel, "I have done what you asked for by installing a king over you.
\v 2 From now on King Saul will lead you and my two sons are among you too. I have been your leader since I was young to this day, but now I am old and my hair is white.
\v 3 So judge me now before you all, and before the LORD, and the king he has chosen: If anyone wants to testify against me, do it now. Have I ever been corrupt or abused my position, so that I took your cow, donkey, or other treasure, or ever oppressed you? Say it now so that I can restore what I have taken or take responsibility for that action.
\p
\v 4 All Israel answered, "No! You never cheated or oppressed us, and never took bribes."
\p
\v 5 Samuel continued, "Today, the LORD and His anointed king testify that I have done nothing wrong to you." They answered, "Yes, the LORD is our witness."
\p
\v 6 Then Samuel said to the people of Israel, "Right! He is the one who chose Moses and Aaron to bring our ancestors out of Egypt.
\v 7 Now, stand here before the LORD and I will remind you how the LORD has done justice to you and our ancestors.
\p
\v 8 "When Jacob and his descendants lived in Egypt as migrants, our ancestors cried out to the LORD for help. Then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron to lead them out of slavery in Egypt, so that they could settle in this land.
\v 9 But our fathers forgot the LORD God, so that He allowed them to be defeated by Sisera, the commander of King Jabin's army at Hazor. And the judgment of the LORD fell upon the people of Israel through the hands of the Philistines, and the king of Moab.\x + \xo 12:9 \xt Jdg. 4; 15-16; 3:12-30.\x*
\p
\v 10 "Every time it happens they cry out to the Lord and say, 'We have sinned because we have left You, O LORD, and worshiped the gods Baal and Ashtoreth! But save us from our enemies, and we will be loyal only to You!'
\v 11 Then the LORD sent Gideon, Barak, Jephthah, and me, to free us from the enemies who have oppressed us from all directions, so that we can live safely.
\p
\v 12 "But when you see King Nahas leading the Ammonites to attack, you say to me," We want a king to rule over us."Even though you already have a King, the LORD God!
\v 13 So pay attention! This is the king you have chosen. According to your request, the LORD has appointed him.
\p
\v 14 "All things will go well if you and the chosen king remain afraid and respect the Lord, remain faithful and obey His commands, and do not rebel against His laws.
\v 15 However, if you disobey the LORD and rebel against the laws of the LORD, the LORD will punish you, as He has repeatedly punished our ancestors.\f + \fr 12:15 \fk as ...\ft TSI translates the last phrase according to the Masoretic Text. The Septuagint writes, 'and your king'.\f*
\p
\v 16 "As proof of that warning, stay standing and pay attention to the miracle that the LORD will perform before your eyes!
\v 17 Now it is the wheat harvest season, and rain usually does not occur. Even so, I will pray to the LORD that He will give thunder and rain. Through that miracle you will realize that you have committed a great evil before the LORD, when you asked to be led by a king."
\p
\v 18 Then Samuel prayed and begged the LORD, and on that very day the LORD sent thunder and rain, so that all the people were very afraid of the LORD and Samuel.
\v 19 Then everyone said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD God that we will not die. We realize that our sins have increased even more because of asking for a king."
\p
\v 20 Then Samuel answered them, "Don't be afraid! Even if you have committed this evil, do not turn away from the LORD. Stay true to the LORD with wholeheartedness.
\v 21 Do not deviate by worshiping idols. It is totally useless, because there are no idols who can help or save you from enemies.
\v 22 Remember that the LORD has chosen us as His chosen people. So He will not dishonor His glorious name by leaving us as His people.
\p
\v 23"As for myself, I will not sin against the LORD by stopping to pray for you! I will definitely continue to teach you everything that is good and right.
\v 24 Honor the Lord and remain faithful to him with all your heart. Never forget all the great deeds that He has done for us.
\v 25 But you need to know: If you continue to do evil things, the LORD will destroy you and your king."
