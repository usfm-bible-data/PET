\s1 The LORD's chest of promise returned to the Israelites
\p
\v 1 After the LORD's chest of promise was retained during seven months in the land of the Philistines,
\v 2 their kings called the priest of the temple of their gods and fortunetellers and asked, "What do we have to do about the chest of the LORD of Israel? Tell us how  is the manner to return to the nation of Israel."
\p
\v 3 They answered, “If you all want to return the chest of Israel's god, don't return it without giving something, but send it with an offering for the redemption of error. If you get healed, then you all will know that their god was the cause of the plague.”
\p
\v 4 Then the kings asked, "What redemption offering for the error must we have to send to the god of Israel?"
\p The priests and fortune tellers answered, "Because  you are five kings, give five bars of gold shaped like tumors that appeared on all of our bodies, and five bars of gold shaped like rats, just like the plague that already attack us and your fifth regions are ruled by you."
\v 5 Make tumor statues and rat statues that have destroyed our land and give honor to the god of Israel. May like this their god will take out his hand from us, and stop disaster that so great to all our pel all land and god.
\v 6 Do not you be stubborn like the King of Egypt and his people? remember that god repeatedly time gave heavy punishment  to them, until finally the King of Egypt and his people was forced let the Israelite nation go free?
\p
\v 7 So, we suggest, make a new chariot that will be pulled by two female cows that just birthed and have never been used to plow. Attach the two cows to the front part of the chariot, but return their calves to their corral.
\v 8 Place the chest of their god \f + \fr 6:8 \fk chest of their god \ft The Hebrew text has 'the chest of the LORD', but these speakers did not believe in God. They consider 'God' to be a divine name only. That's why TSI uses the word 'god' only, so that readers don't think of the speakers as believers.\f* above that chariot, And put in another chest filled with the gold shaped like tumors and rats next to it on the chariot. Then let the cows walk by themselves without being led.
\v 9 And pay attention to this situation, "If the cows pull the cart and go by themselves and up to the border of Beth Shemesh in the area of Israel, then that is a sign that the god of the people of Israel gave this punishment to us\f + \fr 6:9 \fk the cows … \ft The temple priests and fortune tellers made a test that required a miracle to happen. They used two inexperienced cows to pull weights. Because of this, it was highly unlikely that these two cows could walk together along the path, and moreover, no one was directing the both of them. In addition, cows who are still breastfeeding will not leave their calves. \f*. But if it doesn't happen like that, then all of these disasters are just a conincidence."
\p
\v 10 So the kings of the Philistine did exactly like the instructions that they received. They took two milk cows that were still giving milk and connected them to the front part of a chariot, whereas their calves were returned to their previous corral.
\v 11 Then people Philistines put the LORD's chest on the chariot, together with the trunk that was filled with the gold statues of rats and tumors.
\v 12 Then the two cows walked toward Beth Shemesh. The whole time on the road the two cows groaned,\f + \fr 6:12 \fk groaned \ft The sound that comes out of cattle like cows and buffalo.\f* and didn't turn to the left or to the right. During the journey toward border Beth Shemesh, th fifth kings of the Philistines nation walked quite far behind the chariot.
\p
\v 13 At that time the residents of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they saw that the LORD's chest of promise was being brought back to them they were very happy.
\v 14-15 The two cows brought the chariot toward to the field of the people of Beth Shemesh that was named Joshua, and stopped near a large rock. Then the residents of Beth Shemesh that were present took down the chest of promise from that chariot and also the trunk that was with it that was filled with the gold statues, and place the two of them on that large stone. After that they cut up the chariot and made it become fire wood. after that they offered the two cows as a burnt offering and other sacrifices to the LORD.
\v 16 The five kings of the Philistines people observed all thing from a distance, then  they returned to Ekron that day also.
\p
\v 17 There were five gold statues shaped like tumors that were offered by the Philistines people to ask forgiveness of the LORD, that is one statue for the five major cities: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
\v 18 The number of the gold statues shaped like rats were also according to the number of the cities of the Philistines kingdom, and represented the fortified cities and small villages in each region of the five great cities. The large rock in Beth Shemesh in the field of Joshua, where they placed the chest of promise of the LORD, is still be there until now, and that rock became a sign of remembrance of that happening.
\s1 The LORD's chest of promise was moved to Kiriath Jearim
\p
\v 19 However the LORD destroyed  so many man \f + \fr 6:19 \fk so many \ft the tex Masoretic and all ancient Hebrew manuscripts have 50,070 men. The number was thought to be impossible, but there was insufficient support from the ancient manuscripts to write just 70, like some translations. The TSI translation team felt we were more likely to think of this number as a symbolic number, so it was translated as so many"\f* of Beth Shemesh because they looked inside the LORD's chest of promise. Then a that time the people of the district of Beth Shemesh mourned for them, because the LORD punish them harshly.
\v 20 The residents of Beth Shemesh said, "Who can become mediator between us and the LORD God Most Holy? To whom shall we send the LORD"s chest of promise, so that all of us here don't die?"
\p
\v 21 Then the residents of Beth Shemesh sent messengers bringing a message to the residents of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the LORD's chest of promise. Come here and take this chest, and bring it home to your city."
