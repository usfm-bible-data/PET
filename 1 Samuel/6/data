\s1 The LORD's Chest of Promise returned to the Israelites
\p
\v 1 After the LORD's Chest of Promise was retained for seven months in the land of the Philistines,
\v 2 their kings called their gods temple priests and fortunetellers and asked, "What do we have to do to the LORD of Israel's Chest [of Promise]? Tell us in what way to return that Chest to the Israelites."
\p
\v 3 They answered, “If you all want to return the Chest [of Promise] of Israel's God, don't return it without giving something, but send it with an offering for the redemption. If you are healed, then you all will know that their idol was the cause of the plague.”
\p
\v 4 Then the Philistines asked, "What redemption offering sacrifice do we have to give to the God of Israel so that we are forgiven?"
\p The priests and fortune tellers answered, "According to the number of Philistine leaders give five bars of gold shaped like tumors that appeared on all of your bodies and five bars of gold shaped like rats, just like the plague that already struck you all and your five kings."
\v 5 Make tumor statues and rat statues that have destroyed your land and give honor to the God of Israel. Let it He will just stop judging all of the residents, gods and our land.
\v 6 Why are you hard headed like the King of Egypt and his people? Didn't God repeatedly toy with them and judge them so that in the end the King of Egypt and his people had to let the Israelite nation go free?
\v 7 For that, go and make a new cart that will be pulled by two female cows that just birthed and have never been used to plow. Attach the two cows to the front part of the cart, but return their calves to their pen.
\v 8 Place the LORD's Chest of Promise on the cart. And put in another chest filled with the gold shaped like tumors and rats next to the Chest of Promise on the cart. Then let the cows walk by themselves without being led.
\v 9 And pay attention to this situation, "If the cows pull the cart and go by themselves and up to the border of Beth Shemesh in the area of Israel, then that is a sign that the LORD of the Israelites gave this judgment to us. But if it doesn't happen like that, then all of these disasters are just accidental."
\p
\v 10 So the Philistine kings did exactly like the instructions that they received. They took two cows that were still giving milk and connected them to the front part of a cart, whereas their calves were returned to their previous pen.
\v 11 They placed the LORD's Chest of Promise on top of the cart, together with the box that was filled with the gold statues of rats and tumors.
\v 12 Then the two cows walked toward Beth Shemesh. The whole time on the road the two cows groaned,\f + \fr 6:12 \fk groaned \ft The sound that comes out of cattle like cows and buffalo.\f* and didn't turn to the left or to the right. The leaders of the Philistines walked quite far behind the cart the length of the road to the border of Beth Shemesh.
\p
\v 13 At that time the residents of Beth Shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they saw that the LORD's Chest of Promise was being brought back to them they were very joyful.
\v 14-15 The two cows brought the cart headed to the field of the people of Beth Shemesh that was named Joshua, and stopped near a large rock. Then the LORD's leaders from the tribe of Levi that were present took down the LORD's Chest of Promise from that cart and also the box that was with it— filled with the gold statues. They place the two of them on that large stone. After that the residents of Beth Shemesh cut up the cart that was made from wood and made it become fire wood. They offered the two cows as a burnt offering and other sacrifices to the LORD.
\v 16 The five leaders of the Philistines noticed from afar all that happened, then returned to Ekron that day too. \
\p
\v 17 Their were five gold statues shaped like tumors that were offered by the Philistines to ask forgiveness from the LORD— that is one for each of their major cities: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
\v 18 The gold statues shaped like rats were also according to the number of the cities of the Philistines, and represented the fortified cities and small villages in each area of the five large cities. The large rock in Beth Shemesh in the field of Joshua— where they placed the Chest of Promise [of the LORD]— is still there now, and that rock became a sign of remembrance of that happening.
\s1 The LORD's Chest of Promise is moved to Kiriath Jearim
\p
\v 19 However the LORD destroyed seventy\f + \fr 6:19 \fk seventy \ft The Hebrew text that is the best (MT) writes 50,070 men. But that number is considered to be impossible. Because of that, many translations write just 70. CSB translates "70 men out of 50,000 men."\f* men of Beth Shemesh because they looked inside the LORD's Chest of Promise. The people of the district of Beth Shemesh mourned for them, because the LORD judged them harshly.
\v 20 The residents of Beth Shemesh said, "Who can approach the LORD God Most Holy and still remain alive? To whom shall we send the LORD"s Chest of Promise?— so that all of us here don't die!"
\p
\v 21 Then the residents of Beth Shemesh sent messengers bringing a message to the residents of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the LORD's Chest of Promise. Come here and take that Chest, and bring it home to your city."
