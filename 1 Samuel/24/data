\s David lets Saul live
\p
\v 1 After Saul returned from fighting the Philistines, someone told him, "David is hiding in the wilderness at En Gedi."
\v 2 So Saul took three thousand chosen men from the army of Israel and went out to find David and his troops in the region of the hills of the Wild Goats.
\p
\v 3 When Saul and his troops came to a place where there were sheepfolds, Saul entered a cave to defecate. But at that time, David and his troops were hiding in a part of the cave that was a little deeper.
\p
\v 4 Those who were with David said to him, "This is the day the LORD meant when He said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hands, that you may treat him according to your will.'" Then David quietly approached Saul and cut off a little piece from the bottom of his robe.
\p
\v 5 After that, even though Saul was unaware of it, David's conscience was unsettled because he had done this.
\v 6 David said to those who were with him, “May the LORD prevent me from harming the king whom he has chosen! After all, the king is the chosen man of the LORD."
\v 7 With these words, David restrained his troops from directly attacking Saul.
\p Then Saul got up and left the cave and continued on his way.
\v 8 So David came out of the cave also and called Saul, "My Lord, O King!" When Saul looked back, David bowed down,
\p
\v 9 then said to Saul, "Why did my Lord listen to those who said, 'David is plotting to hurt my Lord'?
\v 10 Today my Lord can see with his own eyes how the LORD surrendered you just now into the hands of your servant in this cave. Some people urged me to kill you, but I refused saying, "I will not hurt him in the least, because he is the king chosen by God."
\v 11 Look at the hem of your robe that I am holding! In fact I could have killed you while cutting off the hem of this robe, but I didn't. So realize that I am not planning evil or rebellion. Even though I am innocent, my Lord always chases me to kill me.
\p
\v 12 Let the LORD judge among us, and let the LORD be the defender of your servant from my Lord's attacks! But I myself will never hurt you.
\v 13 As the old saying goes, 'It is a bad person who does evil.' But I myself will never hurt you Sir.
\v 14 Why should the king of Israel pursue me, an insignificant person. I am like a dead dog, or just a flea!
\v 15 Let the LORD judge and mediate among us. Let Him decide my case and release me from my Lord's hand!"
\p
\v 16 When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, O David, my son?" Then Saul wept aloud.
\v 17 Saul said to David, “You are more righteous than I am, because you treated me well, even though I had done something bad to you.
\v 18 Today you have shown how good you are to me. The LORD gave me into your hands, but you did not kill me.
\v 19 If someone's enemy fell into his hands, he would not have let him go safely! May the LORD repay the good deed that you have done to me earlier.
\v 20 I know now that you will become the king over Israel, and that the kingdom of Israel will stand firm under your government.
\v 21 So swear to me in the name of the LORD that you will not kill my family, nor take away all my descendants."
\p
\v 22 So David swore to Saul. Then Saul returned, and David and his troops returned to another refuge.
