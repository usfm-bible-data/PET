\s1 Hannah gives birth to Samuel
\p
\v 1 In the city of Ramah,\f + \fr 1:1 \fk city of Ramah \ft Literally the name of this city is 'Ramathaim-Zophim', but because in other verses the name is shortened to be just 'Ramah', so the TSI writes the general name that is usually used by the writer of the Bible mentioned. This book is indeed about Samuel's ministry, but most commentators say that Samuel was not the author.\f* in the hill district of Ephraim, there was a man of the tribe of Ephraim named Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, and Jeroham was the son of Elihu. Elihu was the son of Tohu, and Tohu was the son of Zuph.\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Zuph \ft In 1 Chron. 6:33-38 it is written that the family of Zuph was one of the descendants of Levi. So this explains that Samuel's connection in the LORD's tabernacle was because he was from the line of Levi's descendants.\f*
\v 2 Elkanah had two wives. The first was named Hannah and the second was named Peninnah. Penninah had several children, whereas Hannah didn't have children.
\p
\v 3 Every year Elkanah went from the city of Ramah to the LORD’s tent at Shiloh to worship and offer a sacrifice to the LORD the Ruler of the Armies of the Universe.\f + \fr 1:3 \fk Ruler of the Armies of the Universe \ft Literally, this phrase means 'LORD of the troops'. This phrase stresses that the LORD is the Authority over everything and has overwhelming military power.\f* The priests who served there were the two sons of the Priest Eli, that is Hophni and Phinehas.
\v 4 Every time Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he always gave several portions of the meat sacrifice to Penninah and her children.
\v 5 But Elkanah gave a meat sacrifice two times greater to Hannah, because he really loved Hannah, even though the LORD had shut her womb so that she didn't have children.
\v 6 Peninnah often looked down on and insulted \f + \fr 1:6 \fk looked down on and insulted \ft At that time it was a disgrace if a woman who was married couldn't give birth to descendants for her husband. \f* Hannah, because the LORD definitely had made Hannah unable to get pregnant.
\v 7 From year to year when Elkanah’s family was at the LORD’s tent, Peninnah always made Hannah bitter/despair, so that Hannah cried and didn't want to eat.
\v 8 Elkanah asked her, "Hannah, why do you cry and not want to eat? Why are you so sad? Aren't I, your husband, more valuable compared to ten sons?"
\p
\v 9 One time in Shiloh, after they had finished eating and drinking, Hannah stood up and went to pray near the the gateway to the yard of the LORD’s tent. At that time the Priest Eli was sitting in his chair beside the door of the that gateway.
\v 10 Hannah prayed to the LORD with great sadness while sobbing.
\v 11 And Hannah vowed to the LORD, "Oh LORD Ruler of the Armies of the Universe, please see the suffering of servant with full compassion, remember and don't forget this servant of Your's. If You give servant a son, then servant will surrender that child to You to serve you his whole life and his hair will never be cut."\f + \fr 1:11 \fk his hair will never be cut \ft This was a sign that Hannah surrendered her child fully to the LORD as a Nazarite. See Numbers 6:5\f*
\v 12 While Hannah prayed to the LORD, Eli watched her lips move.
\v 13 Hannah prayed in her heart, only her lips moved, but her voice wasn't heard. Because of that Eli thought that Hannah was drunk.
\v 14 So Eli said to Hannah; "How long will you continue to be drunk. Throw away your wine!"
\v 15 Hannah answered, "Servant isn't drunk, Master! Servant isn't drinking wine or hard drinks. Servant is very sad and is pouring out all of the contents of servant's heart to the LORD.
\v 16 Don't think servant is a contemptible woman. Since earlier servant only expressed all of servants sadness and suffering to the LORD."
\p
\v 17 Eli answered her, "Go with a peaceful heart. May the God of Israel grant what you requested of Him."
\v 18 Hannah said, “Thank you! May your servant be pleasing before you." Then Hannah left, ate and her face was no longer somber.
\v 19 The next day, while the day was still dawning, Elkanah and his family got up and worshipped the LORD. After that they returned to the city of Ramah. When Elkanah had sex with Hannah, the LORD remembered Hannah's request to have a child.
\v 20 Some time later, Hannah got pregnant and birthed a son. Hannah named the child Samuel,\f + \fr 1:20 \fk Samuel \ft The meaning of Samuel in the Hebrew language is 'God hears', and the way of expressing the word Samuel sounds almost like the word 'request' in the Hebrew language.\f* because she said, "I have requested him of the LORD."
\s Hannah surrenders Samuel to the LORD
\p
\v 21 The following year, Elkanah and his family returned to Shiloh to offer an annual sacrifice to the LORD and also a special sacrifice to complete their vow.\f + \fr 1:21 \fk their vow \ft Literally his vow. It isn't known clearly whether 1) Elkanah made a vow to the LORD that he had to finish, or 2) because Elkanah didn't forbid Hannah's vow, so the vow mentioned was considered to be Elkanah's. See Num. 30:6.|*
\v 22 But Hannah didn't go with them. She said to her husband, “After Samuel has stopped nursing, I will take him there to set him apart for serving the LORD, then Samuel will live from that moment onward at the LORD's house.”
\v 23 So Elkana said to her, "Do what you think is right. Stay here until you are done weaning him. May the LORD help you keep your promise."\f + \fr 1:23 \fk keep your promise \ft Keep your promise according to the Dead Sea text and LXX. In the Masoritic Text it uses 'May the LORD be pleased to keep His promise.'\f* So Hannah remained in Ramah and nursed Samuel until the time came for Samuel to be weaned.
\v 24 When Hannah finished weaning Samuel, Hannah and Elkana took him to the LORD's Tabernacle in Shiloh. He also brought a three year old bull for a sacrificial offering, ten kilograms of flour, and one skin bag full of wine.
\v 25 And after slaughtering the bull, they surrendered Samuel to Eli.
\v 26 Hannah said to Eli, “Sir, do you still remember me (yours servant)? I am the woman who stood here previously, near you (my Master) and prayed to the LORD.
\v 27 Servant requested to the LORD so that He would give me a child. And the LORD granted servant's request.
\v 28 Now I (your servantr) will surrender this child to the LORD. As long as he lives, he will serve the LORD.”
\p Then Samuel\f + \fr 1:28 \fk Samuel \ft The Hebrew says ‘he (singular), and that can mean Samuel, Eli, Elkana, or even Elkana and his family. TSI chooses Samuel as the closest ‘he’, so that the meaning is, even though he was so very young, Samuel started to worship and serve God from that moment. \f* bowed down and worshipped the LORD.
