\s1 Hannah gives birth to Samuel
\p
\v 1 In the city of Ramah,\f + \fr 1:1 \fk city of Ramah \ft Literally the name of this city is 'Ramathaim-Zophim', but because in other verses the name is shortened to be just 'Ramah', so the TSI writes the general name that is usually used by the writer of the Bible mentioned. This book is indeed about Samuel's ministry, but most commentators say that Samuel was not the author.\f* in the hills region of Ephraim, there was a man from the tribe of Ephraim named Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, and Jeroham was the son of Elihu. Elihu was the son of Tohu, and Tohu was the son of Zuph.\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Zuph \ft In 1 Chron. 6:33-38 it is written that the family of Zuph was one of the descendants of Levi. So this explains that Samuel's connection in the LORD's tabernacle was because he was from the line of Levi's descendants.\f*
\v 2 Elkanah had two wives. The first was named Hannah and the second was named Peninnah. Penninah had many children, but Hannah didn't have children.
\p
\v 3 Every year Elkanah went from the city of Ramah to the LORD’s tent at Shiloh to worship and offer a sacrifice to the LORD Almighty.\f + \fr 1:3 \fk LORD Almighty \ft Literally, this phrase means 'LORD above troops'. This phrase emphasize that the LORD is Sovereign above everything and especially above military power so tremendous.\f* The priests who served at the tent of the LORD were the two sons of the Priest Eli, that is Hophni and Phinehas.
\v 4 Every time Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he always gave portions of the meat sacrifice to Penninah and her children.
\v 5 But Elkanah gave portion of the meat sacrifice the best\f + \fr 1:5\fk the best \ft In the Hebrew text this word is difficult to understand, the literal translation is 'two faces'. That is why there are various ways of translating the portion that Elkanah gave to Hannah.\F* to Hannah, because he so loved Hannah, even though the LORD had shut her womb so that she didn't have children.
\v 6 Peninnah often humiliate and insult \f + \fr 1:6 \fk humiliate and insulted \ft At that time it was a disgrace if a woman who was married couldn't give birth to descendants for her husband. \f* Hannah, because the LORD indeed had made Hannah unable to get pregnant.
\v 7 From year to year when Elkanah’s family was at the tent of the LORD, Peninnah always hurt Hannah's heart, so that Hannah cried and didn't want to eat.
\v 8 Elkanah asked her, "Hannah, why do you cry and not want to eat? Why are you so sad? Am I not, your husband, more valuable compared to ten sons?"
\p
\v 9 One time in Shiloh, after they had finished eating and drinking, Hannah stood up and went to pray near the gate yard of the tent of the LORD. At that time the Priest Eli was sitting in his chair beside the door of the that gateway.
\v 10 Hannah prayed to the LORD with great sadness while sobbing.
\v 11 And Hannah vowed to the LORD, "Oh LORD Almighty, please see the suffering of servant with full compassion, remember and don't forget this servant of Your's. If You give servant a son, then servant will surrender him to You to serve You as long as he lives, and his hair will never be cut."\f + \fr 1:11 \fk his hair will never be cut \ft This was a sign that Hannah surrendered her child fully to the LORD as a Nazarite. See Numbers 6:5\f*
\p
\v 12 While Hannah prayed to the LORD, Eli watched her lips move.
\v 13 Hannah prayed in inside heart, only her lips moved, but her voice wasn't heard. Because of that Eli thought that Hannah was drunk.
\v 14 So Eli said to Hannah; "Untill when will you be drunk? Throw away your wine!"
\v 15 Hannah answered, "Servant isn't drunk, Sir! Servant isn't drinking wine or strong drinks. Servant is very sad and is pouring out all of the contents of servant's heart to the LORD.
\v 16 Don't think servant is a despicable woman. Since earlier servant only expressed all sadness and suffering of the servants to the LORD."
\p
\v 17 Answered Eli to her, "if is like that, go with a peaceful heart. May the God of Israel grant what you beg of Him."
\v 18 Hannah said, “Thank you! May your servant be pleasing before you." Then Hannah left, afterwards ate and her face was no longer somber.
\v 19 The next day, while the day was still dawning, Elkanah and his family got up and worshipped the LORD. After that they returned to the city of Ramah. When Elkanah had relations with Hannah, the LORD remembered Hannah's request to have a child.
\v 20 Some time later, Hannah got pregnant and gave birth a son. Hannah named the child Samuel,\f + \fr 1:20 \fk Samuel \ft The meaning of Samuel in the Hebrew language is 'God hears', and the way of saying the word Samuel sounds almost like the word 'request' in the Hebrew language.\f* because she said, "I have requested him of the LORD."
\s Hannah surrenders Samuel to the LORD
\p
\v 21 The following year, Elkanah and his family went again to Shiloh to offer an annual sacrifice to the LORD and also a special sacrifice to fulfill their vow.\f + \fr 1:21 \fk their vow \ft Literally his vow. It isn't known clearly whether 1) Elkanah made a vow to the LORD that he had to finish, or 2) because Elkanah didn't forbid Hannah's vow, so the vow mentioned was considered to be Elkanah's. See Num. 30:6.|*
\v 22 But Hannah didn't go with them. She said to her husband, “After Samuel has stopped nursing, I will take him there to set him apart for ministry of the LORD, then Samuel will live from that moment onward at the LORD's tent.”
\v 23 Then Elkana said to her, "Do what you think is good. Stay here until you are done weaning him. May the LORD help you to fufill your promise."\f + \fr 1:23 \fk fufill your promise \ft Fufill your promise according to the Dead Sea text and LXX. In the Masoritic Text it uses 'May the LORD be pleased to fufill His promise.'\f* So Hannah remained in Ramah and nursed Samuel until the time came for Samuel to be weaned.
\v 24 When Hannah finished weaning Samuel, Hannah and Elkana brought him to the LORD's tent in Shiloh. Hannah also brought a three year old bull\f + \fr 1:24 \fk three years old bull... \ft In the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Septuagint, and Syria it says 'a cow', but in the Masoretic Text it says 'three cows'. Most translators follow the three sources above.\f* for a sacrificial offering, nine kilograms of flour, and one skin bag full of wine.
\v 25 And after slaughtering the bull, they surrendered Samuel to Eli.
\v 26 Hannah said to Eli, “Sir, do you still remember this servant? I am the woman tahat some tima ago stood here , near Sir and prayed to the LORD.
\v 27 Servant begged to the LORD so that He give me a child. And the LORD have granted servant's request.
\v 28 Now servent will surrender this child to the LORD. As long as he lives, he will serve the LORD.”
\p Then Samuel\f + \fr 1:28 \fk Samuel \ft The Hebrew text wrote ‘he (singular), and that can mean Samuel, Eli, Elkana, or Elkana and his family. TSI chooses Samuel as the closest ‘he’ in the context. Even thoughSamuel possible was five years old, that moment Samuel started to worship and serve God. \f* The that moment bowed down and worshipped the LORD.
