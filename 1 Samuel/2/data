\s1 Hannah's expression of thanks to the LORD
\p
\v 1 Then Hannah prayed,
\q1 "Oh LORD, I am very grateful to You!
\q2 I lift high my face because you made me strong!
\q1 I laugh at my enemies because now I can answer my enemies who like to insult,
\q2 because I am grateful that You saved me.
\q1
\v 2 There is no one holy like You, LORD! There is no God but You!
\q2 And there is no protector like You— who is like a mountain of stone place where we shelter!
\b
\q1
\v 3 "Because of that I am brave to speak to my taunters, 'Stop being arrogant and haughty!
\q2 Your mouth can not be used anymore to boast about yourself!
\q1 Because the LORD knows all things,
\q2 and all of our actions will be judged by Him.'
\b
\q1
\v 4 [The bows owned by the heroes will be destroyed,// Oh, LORD, You destroy the bows owned by the people who depend on their own strength].
\q2 But [people who are weak and exhausted receive strength//You strengthen and equip us who are weak and stumble].
\q1
\v 5 Those who previously were always satisfied now have to work to get food.
\q2 But those who were previously often hungry, now are continuously satisfied.
\q1 In fact women who were previously barren, now are satisfied because they have complete families.
\q2 Whereas women who had many children, now feel lonely.
\q1
\v 6 You, oh LORD, are the one who takes life, and You also are the one who gives life to all.
\q2 You are the one also who [sends people to the grave and can resurrect//allow people to feel gravely ill until almost dead. But You also are the one who heals and resurrects them again].
\q1
\v 7 You are the one who makes people poor or rich.
\q2 There are rich people whom You humble to become poor, and also there are poor people whom You raise up to become rich.
\q1
\v 8 There are poor people whom You raise from a contemptible place,
\q2 then to them You give a very high status—
\q2 in fact there are those who become close friends of king's children.
\b
\q1 "These things happen because You are the one who builds the stone foundations of this earth,
\q2 then You placed the earth on top of those foundations!
\q1
\v 9 You certainly guard the people who are faithful to You, \2 whereas evil people will die in darkness.
\q2 Because not by our own strength then we can win over our enemies.
\q1
\v 10 You will show your anger to Your enemies with great thunder,
\q2 then destroy them!
\q2 Because you are the one who judges each person to the ends of the earth.
\q1 You certainly strengthen the person whom You choose to become our king,
\q2 and You will give victory to him and broaden his kingdom."

\v 11 Then Elkanah and Hannah went home to their house in Ramah. But Samuel— their child— remained serving the LORD in the worship place in Shiloh, guided by the Priest Eli.
\s The two children of Eli wrongly used their positions as priests
\p
\v 12 The two children of Eli—Hophni and Phinehas were not good people. They certainly had the job of priest, but didn't submit to the LORD's authority.
\v 13 They didn't follow the regulations that were determined in the Law for priests. For example, when a person was cooking a meat offering that he and his family could eat, while the meat was boiling, a priest helper\f + \fr 2:13 \fk priest helper \ft It's possible there was a group of Levite males who had the job of helping the priests serve in the LORD's Tent. Usually there were two or more people who had the job of helping each time a priest served the Israeli people who came to worship.\f* came with a long large fork with three teeth in his hand.
\v 14 That priest's helper stuck it into the basin, pot, kettle or pan, and everything that was skewered by the fork would be taken by him to give to Hophni and Phinehas. This is what Hophni and Phinehas usually did to all of the Israelites when they came to offer their annual sacrifices in Shiloh.
\v 15 In fact before the priest who had the job opportunity to burn all of the fat from the sacrificial offering of a person, the two helpers of Hophni and Phinehas would come and say to the person giving the sacrificial offering, "Give some of the raw meat to be roasted by my master! He won't receive meat that is boiled from you—only raw meat."
\p
\v 16 If the person who was doing the offering said to that helper, "According to the regulations the fat has to be burned by them first, then please take whatever part they want," then the helper would answer, "No! Give it now too! If you refuse, I will take it by force!"
\p
\v 17 The sin of Hophni and Phinehas were very great in the LORD's sight, because they insulted the offerings that were intended for the LORD.
\p
\v 18 Samuel— even though still a child, served the LORD dressed with an ephod shirt like a priest.
\v 19 Every year, Hannah and Elkanah still visited Shiloh to bring the annual offering. Before they left for Shiloh, Hannah always made a new robe for Samuel to give to him.
\v 20 And every year Eli always blessed Elkanah and Hannah by saying, "May the LORD give many children to Hannah to replace Samuel who was surrendered to the LORD!"
\p After that, they went home.
\v 21 Then the LORD was generous to Hannah, she got pregnant and birthed three sons and two daughters. From childhood time until adulthood, Samuel always was involved in serving in the LORD's tent.
\p
\v 22 The Priest Eli was already very old when he heard about all of the things that his two children— Hophni and Phinehas, did to the Israelites, and how they were one body with several women who received people who came to worship the LORD at the door of His tent.\f + \fr 2:22 \fk His tent \ft Literally, "tent of meeting."\f*
\v 23 Eli said to Hophni and Phinehas, "Why do you two do like this?! Often people come telling complaints that you do all kinds of evil!
\v 24 My children, this should not happen! Bad news about you continually is spoken by all the [LORD's] people!
\v 25 If a person sins against his fellowman, then we can ask God to heal the relationship between the two people. But if a person sins against the LORD Himself, there is no other person who can make peace between the LORD and that person!"
\p But Hophni and Phinehas didn't hear their father's rebuke, so that the LORD decided to destroy them.
\p
\v 26 Meanwhile Samuel increasingly grew to adulthood and was liked by the LORD and all people.
\p
\s Warning to the family of the Priest Eli
\p
\v 27 They were not only given a warning, but a prophet of God came and met Eli and said to him, "Listen to the news from the LORD! 'I revealed Myself to the forefathers of Aaron, when they were still slaves in the land of Egypt and under the power of the King of Egypt.
\v 28 I chose your forefathers from among all of the tribes of Israel to become My priests, to offer sacrifices at My altar, burn incense, and wear the ephod shirt before Me. I gave your forefathers all of the burned offerings that are made by the Israelites.
\v 29 Why do you look down on will sacrifices and offerings for Me? You respect your children more than Me by making yourself fat by taking the best part of all of the offerings that are brought by My people the Israelites.'
\p
\v 30 "Because of that the LORD God of Israel says, 'I certainly said that your family and your forefathers would serve Me forever.' But now the LORD says, 'It won't be like that anymore! Because I will respect whoever respects Me, but whoever looks down on Me I will curse!
\v 31 In fact, the time has come when I will end your life and your forefathers. There won't be any person who has a long life from your family!
\v 32 You will see trouble in the place I live! The Israelites will receive blessings, but forever their will not be a person who has a long life in your family.
\v 33 And whichever of the members of your family remain alive, I will make their eyes blind and make them languish. All who are born into your family will not ever reach old aage, but will die in youth.
\v 34 This is what will be a sign for you what will be fulfilled by your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: the two of them will die on the same day!
\p
\v 35 "'And I will raise up for Me a priest that is faithful He will do whatever is in My heart and My soul. I will raise up for him descendants that are firm and will serve My chosen people for all time.
\v 36 Everyone who lives from your family will come and kneel before him for a little money and bread. Everyone of them will say: Give me work priest so that I can eat a piece of bread.'"
