\s1 Hannah's expression of thanks to the LORD
\p
\v 1 Then Hannah prayed,
\q1 "Oh LORD, your servant greatly rejoice because of You!
\q2 I lift high my face because you made me strong!\f + \fr 2:1 \fk lift high my face \ft This line can be translated literally as ‘My horn is lifted high in the LORD’. In Hebrew the words ‘lift up horn’ is an idiom that illustrate a animal lifting its horn high because of feeling proud. This idiom can be compared with a pat in the chest, that the feeling of proud after someone achieve victory. Because of that it is translated as ‘give victory’ in Ex. 2:10.\f*
\q1 I laugh at my enemies, because now I can answer them that like to insult.
\q2 I rejoice because You saved me.
\q1
\v 2 There is no one holy like You, LORD! There is no God but You!
\q2 There is no mountain of stone like You!
\b
\q1
\v 3 "Because of that I dare to speak to my taunters, 'Stop being arrogant and haughty!
\q2 Your mouth can not be used anymore to boast about yourself!
\q1 Because the LORD knows all things,
\q2 and all of our deeds will be judged by Him.'
\b
\q1
\v 4 The bow of the heroes You broke,
\q2 but we who are weak and have no strength receive new power.
\q1
\v 5 They who previously were always satisfied now have to work to get food.
\q2 But we that were previously often hungry, now are continuously feels satisfied.
\q1 Even women that were previously barren, now are satisfied because they have complete families.
\q2 Whereas women who had many children, now feel lonely.
\q1
\v 6  LORD, You  are the one who takes life,
\q2 and You also are the one who gives life to everybody.
\q1 You can take someone to Sheol,\x + \xo 2:6 \xt Kej. 37:35\x*
\q2 but you can raise someone again.
\q2
\q1
\v 7 You are the one who makes people poor or rich.
\q2 You that humble some people, and also exalt other people.
\q1
\v 8 There are poor people that You take from a contemptible place,
\q2 then to them You give a very high status —
\q2 even there are that become close friends of king's children.
\b
\q1 "These things happen because You that builds the stone foundations of this earth,
\q2 then You placed the earth on top of tha foundation!
\q1
\v 9 You certainly guard the people that are faithful to You,
\q2 whereas evil people will be destroyed in misery.
\q2 Because not by our own power that we can win over our enemies.
\q1
\v 10 You will show your anger to Your enemies with great thunder,
\q2 then destroy them!
\q2 You that will judges each person to the ends of the earth.
\q1 You certainly strengthen the person that You choose to become our king,
\q2 and You will give victory to him and expand his kingdom."
\b
\p
\v 11 Then Elkanah and Hannah went home to their house in Ramah. But Samuel remained serving the LORD in the tent of the LORD in Shiloh, guided by the Priest Eli.
\s The two children of Eli wrongly used their positions as priests
\p
\v 12 The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas were  people that so bad behavior. They indeed worked as priests, but belittled the LORD.
\v 13 They didn't follow the regulations that were determined in the Law  Torat for the priests. For example, when a person was cooking a meat offering that he and his family could eat, while the meat was boiling, a priest helper\f + \fr 2:13 \fk priest helper \ft possibly that was meant is man from the tribe of Levite, that was assigned to help the priest that was serving in the altar of sacrifice. Usually there were some people of Levite tribe  or other priest who had the duty of helping each time a priest served the Israeli people offer sacrifice.\f* came with a long large fork with three teeth in his hand.
\v 14 That priest's helper stab it into the basin, pot, griddle or pan, and everything that was skewered by the fork would be taken by him to give to Hophni and Phinehas. This is what Hophni and Phinehas usually did to all of the person of Israel when they came to offer their annual sacrifices in Shiloh.
\v 15 even before the priest duty burn all of the fat from the sacrificial offering of a person, the helper of Hophni and Phinehas would come and say to the person giving the sacrifice, "Give some of the raw meat to be roasted by my master! He won't receive meat that is boiled from you, but only raw meat."
\p
\v 16 If the person that brought the offer say, "According to the regulations the fat must be burned first, after that please take whatever part you want," then the helper would answer, "No! Give it right now! If you refuse, I will take it by force!"
\p
\v 17 The sin of Hophni and Phinehas were very great in the LORD's sight, because they insulted the offerings that were intended for the LORD.
\p
\v 18 Meanwhile, Samuel who was still a child continued to serve the LORD. He also wore an ephod shirt like a priest.
\v 19 Every year, Hannah make new tunic to Samuel,  and bring it when she and Elkanah goes  to Shiloh to give offer annual.
\v 20 And every year Eli always blessed Elkanah and Hannah by saying, "May the LORD give many children to Hannah to replace Samuel that she surrendered to the LORD!"
\p After that, they went home.
\v 21 Then the LORD was generous to Hannah, so that  she conceive and gave birth three sons and two daughters. And Samuel, From childhood time until adulthood, always was involved in serving in the LORD's tent.
\p
\v 22 Eli was already very old when he heard about all evil that his two sons did to the people of Israel, For example, he already heard that Hophni and Phinehas had relations with several women that did many kinds of tasks in the gate yard of the tent of the LORD.\f + \fr 2:22 \fk yard of the LORD \ft Literally, "tent of meeting." see the note in Ex. 40:2 \f*
\v 23 Eli said to Hophni and Phinehas, "Why do you two do like this?! Often people come telling complaints that you do all kinds of evil!
\v 24 My children, this should not happen! Bad news about you continually is spoken by all the LORD's people!
\v 25 If a person sins against his fellowman, then we can ask God to restore the relationship between the two people. But if a person sins against the LORD Himself, there is no other person who can be a peacemaker between the LORD and that person!"
\p But Hophni and Phinehas didn't hear their father's rebuke, so that the LORD decided to destroy them.
\p
\v 26 Meanwhile Samuel increasingly grew to adulthood and was liked by the LORD and all people.
\p
\s Warning to the family of the Priest Eli
\p
\v 27 A prophet of God  met Eli and said, "Listen to the news from the LORD! 'I revealed Myself to your forefather  Aaron and all his descendants, when My people were still slaves in the land of Egypt and under the power of the King of Egypt.
\v 28 I chose Aaron from among all of the tribes of Israel to become My first priest, to offer sacrifices at My altar, burn incense, and wear the ephod shirt before Me. And to you, his descendants, I gave the ministry special to offer all sacrifice burned that are given by the Israelites.
\v 29 So why you and your children look down on sacrifices and offerings given to Me? You respect your children more than Me, and make yourself fat by taking the best part of all of the offerings that are brought by My people the Israelites.'
\p
\v 30 "Therefore the LORD God of Israel says, 'I certainly promised that the descendants of Aaron would serve Me forever.' But now I say, 'It won't be like that anymore! Because I will respect whoever respects Me, but curse the person that look  Me low!
\v 31 even, have arrived  the time that I will end your authority and your grandchildren as priest. There won't be any person who has a long life from your family!
\v 32 Even you will witness it when tragedy befall on my dwelling place! Starting now and forever, others among the people of Israel will get many blessings, but among your descendants there will not be one person who has a long life.
\v 33 Anyone of your descendants that  remain alive and allowed to eat the meat of the sacrifice of my altar, he will  cry and languish until his eyes become blind.  All your descendants will not ever reach old age, but will die in youth.
\v 34 This is what will happened to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, become a  sign for you! They will die on the same day!
\p
\v 35 "'But I will raise up  other great priest that is faithful serving me according to my will. And I will give many descendants and confirm them, so that all the time his descendants will serve me as priest. Even will be people that work as priest for king that I anoint in above my people.
\v 36 Ever man that still lives from your descendants will come and kneel before the great priest to ask for money and food saying, "Please give me work in the tent of the LORD, so that I can get food.'"
