\c 29
\s Philistine kings reject David from joining the Philistine army.
\p
\v 1 The Philistines assembled all their armies in the valley of Aphek, while the army of Israel camped at the spring in the city of Jezreel, in the same valley.
\v 2-3 Then the Philistine kings arranged their armies so that they were divided into groups of one hundred and groups of a thousand. When the other four Philistine kings saw David and his troops joining in at the rear of Achish's army, they refused, saying, "Why are the Israelites here!"
\p Achish replied, “This is David, who used to serve Saul. But he's been nearly two years \x + \xo 29:3 \xt 1 Sam. 27:7 \x* with me. I haven't found anything wrong with him since he left Saul and joined me until now! "
\p
\v 4 But they became angry with Achish and said to him, “Send him back to the place you gave him! He cannot go to battle with us. Don't let him turn to be our opponent. The reward that will surely please its first master is the beheaded heads of our troops!
\v 5 Remember this is David, the man to whom they sang and danced,
\p 'Saul has killed thousands of his enemies,
\q2 but David killed tens of thousands of enemies! '"
\p 6 So Achish called David and said to him, “I declare before the LORD of living Israel that you have been faithful in my service. I want us to enter this battle together. Because, since you joined me to this day, I have found no fault in you. But according to the opinion of the other four city kings, you cannot be trusted.
\v 7 So, come home with a calm heart. Please don't do anything to offend the four kings!”
\p
\v 8 But David said to Achish, "Why?! What fault have you found in your servant, since I came before you to this day, so that I may not fight against the enemy of my lord the king? "
\p
\v 9 Achish answered David, "I consider you almost like an angel, because you can always be trusted! However, the Philistine kings said, "He must not go to war with us."
\v 10 Early in the morning, you and your troops who have served the king of Israel will return to your residence. "
\p
\v 11 So early in the morning David and his troops returned to the land of the Philistines, while the Philistine army left for Jezreel.
