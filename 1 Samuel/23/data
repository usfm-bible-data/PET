\c 23
\s David saves the people of Keilah
\p
\v 1-6 When Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at the city of Keilah, he took the ephod with the Urim and Thummim. Some time later, David received news, "The Philistines are fighting against the city of Keilah and plundering the wheat crop from the threshing floor." Then David called Abiathar so that he would help ask the LORD for instructions, "Shall I go and attack this Philistine nation?"
\p The LORD answered him, "Go, attack the Philistines and save the inhabitants of Keilah."
\p But David's army said to him, “Behold, we are afraid of being attacked by Saul here in the land of Judah! Are we not in danger if we go to Keilah and attack that Philistine army?!”
\p So David asked the LORD again, and the LORD answered him again, "Go now to Keilah, for I will give you victory over the Philistines." So David and his army went to the city of Keilah and fought against the Philistines. David totally defeated them and took their livestock, and saved the people of Keilah.
\s Once again David avoids Saul
\p
\v 7 Soon Saul received news that David was in Keilah. Saul said, “God has given David into my hands! For he is trapped in a city surrounded by a fortress and the gates are closed. When my troops surround the city, he won't be able to escape!”
\v 8 So Saul assembled his entire army to besiege Keilah, to capture and kill David and his troops.
\p
\v 9 When David learned of Saul's plan, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod here!"
\v 10 Then David asked for instructions saying, "O LORD God of Israel, I have heard clearly that Saul is planning to come to Keilah to destroy this city because of me.
\v 11 Will the people of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come just as I heard? O LORD God of Israel, please answer me!”
\p The LORD answered, "Saul is coming."
\p
\v 12 David asked again, "Will the leaders of Keilah hand me and my troops over into Saul's hands?"
\p Then the LORD answered, "They will give you up."
\s David hides in the wilderness
\p
\v 13 Then David and his army, which numbered about six hundred, left Keilah. They moved from one place to another. When Saul was told that David had fled the city of Keilah, he stopped planning to pursue him there.
\p
\v 14 During he runanway, David lived in refuges in the wilderness and hills of Ziph. Saul continued to chase him, but God did not give David into his hands.
\p
\v 15 David realized that Saul would continue to hunt him to kill him. David was in a refuge near the city of Horesh in the wilderness of Ziph.
\v 16 But Jonathan came to David and strengthened him to keep relying on God.
\v 17 Jonathan said to David, “Don't be afraid! Because my father won't find you. You will rule over the Israelites, and I will be the second under you. Even my father realizes that."
\v 18 So David and Jonathan made their covenant of friendship before the Lord again. After this Jonathan returned, and David remained in Horesh.
\p
\v 19 However, some of the Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “David is hiding among us in a refuge in Horesh, which is on Mount Hakilah and south of Jeshimon.
\v 20 Now, if my Lord the King is pleased to come, please come at any time. Let us catch him and hand him over to you."
\p
\v 21 Saul answered them, “The LORD has blessed you, because you were merciful to me!
\v 22 Go and check again carefully. Make sure exactly where he is and who is with him, because I have been told that he is very cunning.
\v 23 Find all the hiding places he uses, then come back again with the correct information. Then I will go with you. If he is in that area, I will hunt him down, even if I have to search for him among the thousands of people of Judah.
\v 24 So the Ziphites went ahead of Saul to Ziph.
\p David and his army were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah Valley to the south of Jeshimon.
\v 25 When Saul heard about this, he and his army chased David there, but someone told David about it. So David moved to the rocky hills in the wilderness of Maon.
\p
\v 26 So Saul was chasing him on one side of the rock, at the same time David and his army were on the other side trying to escape them. Saul and his men almost saw David and his army.
\v 27 But at that very moment a message arrived to Saul, “Hurry back! The Philistines have attacked our land again!”
\v 28 That is why Saul stopped chasing David and went to war with the Philistines. Since then, the stone hill has been called: Rock of Escape.
\v 29 From that place David went and lived in a refuge in the caves of En Gedi.
