\c 18
\s1 David and Jonathan
\p
\v 1 When David finished talking with Saul, he met Jonathan. At that time the friendship between them immediately became very close. Jonathan loved David as himself.
\v 2 From that day on, Saul made David his steward and did not allow him to return to his father's house.
\v 3 So Jonathan and David made a friendship covenant, because Jonathan loved David as much as himself.
\v 4 As a sign of the covenant, Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David. Jonathan also gave him his sword, arrows, belt, and armor.
\p
\v 5 Wherever Saul sent David, David always won. Saul appointed David to be one of the commanders of the army. This was welcomed by all the people and also the commanders.
\p
\v 6 However, a few days after David killed Goliath, while the troops were returning from the battle, women from every city in Israel came to greet King Saul, dancing with joy, and singing along with tambourines and cymbals.
\v 7 The women sang to one another,
\p "Saul has killed thousands of enemies,
\q2 and David killed tens of thousands."
\p
\v 8 Then King Saul became angry, because the words of the song of the women irritated him. Saul thought, “David has killed tens of thousands, and they say I've only killed thousands. Soon, they will surely make David king!"
\v 9 From that time on, Saul became jealous of David.
\p
\v 10 The next day, a tormenting spirit from God took control of Saul, so that he was possessed and screamed like a madman in his house. Then David played his lute as he always did to calm Saul's heart. At that time Saul was holding a spear in his hand.
\v 11 Then Saul hurled his spear thinking, "I will stick David in the wall." But David dodged it twice.
\p
\v 12 Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David, but left Saul.
\v 13 So Saul sent David away from him, making him commander of a thousand soldiers. But whenever David led his troops in battle,
\v 14 the LORD was with him, so that he always defeated the enemy army.
\v 15 When Saul saw that what David did was always successful, he became even more afraid of David.
\v 16 The whole nation of Israel and Judah loved David, because he was so successful in leading his troops.
\s1 David marries Saul's daughter
\p
\v 17 Saul said to David, “I will join you in marriage to Merab, my oldest daughter, but you must continue to serve me as a mighty commander in the battles for the LORD.” For Saul thought, “Don't let me kill him. Let the Philistines do that."
\p
\v 18 But David answered, "Your servant is only an ordinary man, my Lord the King! My father's family also has no position among the Israelites. Your servant is not suitable to be the king's son-in-law!”
\v 19 But when the time had come for his wedding, suddenly Saul changed his plans and married Merab to Adriel from the city of Mehola.
\p
\v 20 Meanwhile, Michal, another daughter of Saul, fell in love with David. When Saul was told that, he was pleased
\v 21 because he thought, "I will use Michal as an instrument to get David killed by the Philistines." So Saul said to David a second time: "I will give you another chance to be my son-in-law."
\p
\v 22 So Saul secretly gave orders to his servants to say to David, "Behold, the king really likes you, and his servants are also pleased with you. Now is the right time for you to become the son-in-law of the king!”
\p
\v 23 When the message was delivered to David, David replied, "How can a poor person from a low-ranking family pay the bride price for a daughter of a king?!"
\p
\v 24 Saul's servants told him David's answer.
\p
\v 25 Then Saul said, "Say this to David, 'The king wants no bride price other than a hundred foreskin of the Philistines, as retribution against his enemies.'" But Saul's hope was for David to be killed by the Philistines.
\p
\v 26 When the king's servants told David about it, David agreed to be the king's son-in-law. So, before the appointed time has passed,
\v 27 David and his army went and killed two hundred Philistine men. David took the foreskins of the corpses and gave them all to the king as his bride price. Then Saul gave Michal to be the wife of David.
\p
\v 28 When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and how much Michal loved David,
\v 29 Saul grew more and more afraid of David. And he remained hostile toward David all his life.
\p
\v 30 Whenever the Philistine army attacked the Israelites, David was always more successful in defeating them than all of Saul's other commanders, so that David's name became famous.
