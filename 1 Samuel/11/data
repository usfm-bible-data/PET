\s1 Saul defeats the Ammonites
\p
\v 1 At that time, King Nahas\f + \fr 11:1 \fk Nahas \ft The meaning of the name Nahas was a snake. \f* from the Ammonites\f + \fr 11:1 \fk Ammonites \ft For background behind the war between the Ammonites and the Israelites, see Rights. 11.\f* led his army across the Jordan River and surrounded the city of Jabez in the territory of Gilead. The inhabitants of the city of Jabez said to King Nahas, "Make a peace treaty with us, then we will submit to you."
\p
\v 2 King Nahas answered, "I will make a pact with you, but on one condition, that is, each man's right eye must be gouged out with a sharp object so that he becomes blind. That way I will shame all the Israelites!"\f + \fr 11:2 \fk shame ... \ft Nahas wanted this based on his pride. In this way he would insult and weaken all the men and thus humiliate the nation Israel. By blinding each man's right eye, they would become useless and be considered weak, because they could not fight well, so that Israel would not have a line of defense. \f*
\p
\v 3 The elders of the city of Jabez replied to him, "Give us seven days to send messengers to all the territory of Israel to convey to everyone your(Sir) demands. If no one comes to help us, we will surrender ourselves to you(Sir)."
\p
\v 4 Nahas felt that no one would come, so he agreed to their offer. When the messengers from Jabez arrived in the city of Gibeah, where Saul lived, they conveyed what had happened and the conditions proposed by King Nahas. So all the inhabitants of the city wailed loudly.
\v 5 When the news was delivered, Saul was walking home from his field. He came home directing a pair of bulls he had used to plow. Arriving in the city he asked, "What's the matter? Why are you all lamenting?" Then they told him the news from Jabez.
\p
\v 6 When Saul heard the news, the Spirit of God controlled him, and Saul became very angry.
\v 7 He took the pair of cows, chopped up the two cows and ordered the messengers to deliver the pieces to all corners of Israel with the message, "Anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel in the war, his cattle will end up like these pieces of meat!" The LORD made all the Israelites afraid of what Saul could do if they did not obey him. So they all immediately gathered together.
\v 8 Saul gathered and counted them in Bezek. The army of Israel was as much as three hundred thousand people. And the army of the tribe of Judah was as much as thirty thousand.
\p
\v 9 Then Saul said to the messengers from Jabez, "Come back and deliver this to the inhabitants of Jabez, 'Tomorrow, when the sun is hot, you will be saved.'" When the messengers returned and delivered Saul's message, all the inhabitants of Jabez rejoiced.
\p
\v 10 Then the leaders of Jabez approached and said to Nahas, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you. Treat us as you wish."
\v 11 Saul divided the people who had gathered into three groups of troops. The next morning at sunrise, they stormed into the Ammon army camp, and slaughtered them all morning. Before noon, they had finished off almost all the Ammonite troops. The remaining enemy soldiers who managed to escape were scattered to get away, not even two of them were still together.
\s Saul is appointed king
\p
\v 12 Then the people of Israel praised Saul to Samuel, "If there are still people who do not agree for Saul to be our king, bring them here! We will kill them!"
\p
\v 13 But Saul answered, "No! Today I will not condemn anyone, because today the LORD has saved Israel."
\p
\v 14 Then Samuel said to the people of Israel, "Let us go together to Gilgal to confirm Saul's appointment as our king!"
\v 15 Then all the people of Israel went to Gilgal, and there before the LORD Samuel installed Saul for the second time as king. Then they offered a thanksgiving sacrifice for their peace with the LORD. Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced.
