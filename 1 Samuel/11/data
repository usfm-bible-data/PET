\s1 Saul defeats the Ammonites
\p
\v 1 At that time, King Nahash\f + \fr 11:1 \fk Nahash \ft The meaning of the name Nahas was a snake. \f* from the Ammonites\f + \fr 11:1 \fk Ammonites \ft For background of the war between the Ammonites and the Israelites, see Judge. 11.\f* led his army across the Jordan River and surrounded the city of Jabesh in the region of Gilead. The population of the city of Jabesh said to the King Nahash, "Make a peace treaty with us, then we will submit to you."
\p
\v 2 King Nahash answered, "I will make a agreement with you, but with on one condition, that is,the right eye of every man must be gouged out with a sharp object so that he becomes blind. That way I will make shame of all the nation of Israel!"\f + \fr 11:2 \fk shame ... \ft Nahas wanted this for his own pride. In this way he would insult and weaken all the men and thus humiliate the nation of Israel. By blinding each man's right eye, they would become useless and be considered weak, because they could not fight well, so that Israel would not have a line of defense. \f*
\p
\v 3 The elders of the city of Jabesh replied to him, "Give us time of seven days to send carrier message to all the territory of Israel to tell to all people Sir demands. If no one comes to help us, we will surrender ourselves to Sir."
\p
\v 4 Nahash felt that no one would come, so he agreed to their offer. When the messengers from Jabesh arrived in the city of Gibeah, which is the place Saul lived, they conveyed what had happened and the requirement requested by King Nahash. Then all the inhabitants of the city mourned with loud voice.
\v 5 When the news was delivered, Saul was walking coming home from his field. He came home guiding a pair of bulls he had used to plow. Arriving in the city he asked, "What's the matter? Why are you all mourning?" Then they told him the news from Jabesh.
\p
\v 6 When Saul heard the news, the Spirit of God possess him, and Saul became very angry.
\v 7 He took the pair of cows and chopped it up, then ordered the messengers to bring that pieces to all rimland of Israel with the message, "Each person that does not follow Saul and Samuel in the war, his cow will end up like these pieces of meat!" The LORD made all the people of Israel becaome afraid of what Saul could do if they did not obey him. So they all immediately gathered together.
\v 8 Saul gathered and counted them in Bezek. The army of Israel was as much as three hundred thousand people. And the troops of the tribe of Judah was as much as thirty thousand people.
\p
\v 9 Then Saul said to the carrier message from Jabesh, "Go back and tell this to the residentes of Jabesh, 'Tomorrow, when the sun is hot, you will be saved.'" When the carrir message returned and delivered Saul's message, all the inhabitants of Jabesh rejoiced.
\p
\v 10 Then the leaders of Jabesh approached and said to Nahash, "Tomorrow we will surrender ourselves to you. Treat us as Sir wish."
\v 11 Saul divided the people who had gathered into three groups of troops. The next morning at sunrise, they invade into the Ammon army camp, and slaughtered them all morning. Before noon, they had finished off almost all the Ammonite troops. The remaining enemy soldiers who managed to escape were scattered flee themselves, not even two of them were still together.
\s Saul is consecrated to become king
\p
\v 12 Then the people of Israel praised Saul to Samuel, "If there are still people who do not agree for Saul to be our king, bring them here! We will kill them!"
\p
\v 13 But Saul answered, "No! Today I will not condemn anyone, because today the LORD has saved Israel."
\p
\v 14 Then Samuel said to the people of Israel, "Let us go together to Gilgal to confirm Saul's consacration as our king!"
\v 15 Then all the people of Israel went to Gilgal, and there before the LORD Samuel set Saul for the second time as king. Then they offered a thanksgiving sacrifice for their peace with the LORD. Saul and all the nation of Israel rejoiced.
