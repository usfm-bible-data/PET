\c 16
\s1 David anointed as king
\p
\v 1 Finally the LORD spoke to Samuel, "You need not continue to be sad because of Saul, because I have rejected him as king over Israel. Fill your oil horn with olive oil and go to Bethlehem. I am sending you to meet Jesse, the Bethlehemite, because I have chosen on of his son to be king."
\p
\v 2 Samuel said, "How can I go there?! If Saul hears that, he will surely kill me."
\p The LORD answered, "Bring a young cow and say to the inhabitants of Bethlehem, 'I have come to serve you by offering this sacrifice to the LORD.'
\v 3 Invite Jesse to go to the sacrifice ceremony, and I will tell you what you must do. There I will show you the child you will anoint."
\p
\v 4 Samuel did everything according to the LORD's command to him. When he arrived in Bethlehem the elders in the city welcomed him with fear and trembling saying, "Sir, we hope you bring good news."
\p
\v 5 Samuel answered, "Yes, I have come to serve you by offering this sacrifice to the LORD. Purify yourselves\f + \fr 16:5 \fk Purify ... \ft See the note in Gen. 35:2 and an example of the custom of purification in Leviticus. 17:15-16. Since Samuel was holding a purification ceremony on this occasion, it is possible he was carrying water of purification that was provided according to the regulations contained in Num. 19:1-9.\f* so that you can attend this sacrifice ceremony." He invited Jesse and his children to the sacrifice and held a ritual of purification for them.
\p
\v 6 When they had gathered, Samuel saw Eliab, Jesse's firstborn son, and thought, "Surely this is the man whom the LORD has chosen!"
\p
\v 7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look at his face or height, for I have not chosen him. I don't judge someone the way humans judge. Humans judge based on appearance alone, but I judge the contents of the heart."
\p
\v 8 Then Jesse called his second son, named Abinadab, and made him walk before Samuel. But Samuel said, "This person is not the one chosen by the LORD."
\v 9 Then Jesse made Shammah walk in front of Samuel, but Samuel said, "He is not chosen by the LORD."
\v 10 Thus Jesse showed seven of his sons to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen any of them."
\v 11 Then Samuel asked, "Are they your only sons?"
\p Jesse answered, "There is still the youngest but he is tending our flock." So Samuel said, "Order someone call him because we will not sit and eat together before he comes."
\p
\v 12 So Jesse sent men to fetch David. It turned out that David was a handsome young man, his eyes were beautiful and his face reddish. As soon as David came, the LORD spoke to Samuel, "Here he is! Anoint him to be king."
\p
\v 13 Then Samuel took the horn of olive oil and anointed David before his brothers. From that moment onward, the Spirit of the LORD accompanied David with power. Then Samuel returned to Ramah.
\s1 David in Saul's palace
\p
\v 14 But by that time the Spirit of the LORD had left Saul and the LORD had sent another spirit to torment his mind.\f + \fr 16:14 \fk The LORD had sent another spirit ... \ft The Hebrew text clearly says that it was God who sent or ordered this 'spirit'. Some translations translate an adjective about this spirit as 'evil', but because the Sender of the spirit was not the devil, but the LORD, TSI interprets the adjective as 'tormenter' or 'disturber'. This case can be compared to the story in 1 Kings 22:19-24. \f*
\p
\v 15 Therefore, Saul's attendants said to him, "My Lord the king, apparently the spirit that came from God is tormenting your mind.
\v 16 Let us find someone who is good at playing the harp and bring him to my Lord the King. If the tormenting spirit comes to bother you, tell him to play the harp, then the sound of the harp will calm and heal you."
\p
\v 17 Saul said, "All right, look for someone who is good at playing the harp and bring him here."
\p
\v 18 His attendant answered, "A Bethlehemite named Jesse has a son who is good at playing the harp. He is also brave, articulate, and handsome looking. And the LORD is always with him."
\p
\v 19 Then Saul sent a messenger to Jesse with the message, "Send your son David, who is tending your flock."
\v 20 Then Jesse sent David to Saul, along with a gift for Saul, which was a donkey loaded with bread, an animal skin bag filled with wine, and a goat.
\p
\v 21 Thus David came to Saul and began serving him. Saul loved David very much, and appointed him as his weapon bearer.
\p
\v 22 Then Saul sent a messenger to Jesse to deliver the message, "Let David remain my attendant, because I like him very much."
\p
\v 23 From then on, if the tormenting spirit came from God and disturbed Saul, David immediately took the harp and played it. Then Saul immediately felt calm again, and the tormenting spirit left him.
