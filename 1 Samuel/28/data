\s Saul meets a sorceress at Ein Dor
\p
\v 1 One day during that time, the Philistines gathered their troops to fight against the Israelites. King Achish said to David, "Understand that you and your troops will be joined together with my troops in this battle."
\p
\v 2 David answered to Achish, "Very well! My master will see for himself what we can do!"
\p So Achish said to David, "Then you will be my personal bodyguard forever."
\p
\v 3 At that time Samuel was already dead. All Israel mourned and he was buried in Ramah, his hometown. And Saul had cast out all the sorcerers from the land of Israel.\f + \fr 28:3 \fk cast out... \ft Saul's actions in this verse are nearly in accordance with Exod. 22:18. Rather than 'casting out', the verse in Exodus says to put all sorcerers to death. The Hebrew language uses two terms which the TSI brings together in the term 'sorcerer'. The first means that a self-proclaimed person can summon a spirit and talk to it. And the second word means witch. These two words have the connotation of deception as well as a connection with evil spirits.\f*
\p
\v 4 Meanwhile, the Philistine army gathered and camped at Shunem. Saul assembled all Israel's army and camped at the foot of Mount Gilboa.
\v 5 When Saul saw how large the Philistine army was, he was very afraid.
\v 6 He asked the LORD for guidance, but the LORD did not answer him, either through dreams, or through the Urim and Thummim, or through the words of the prophets.
\v 7 So Saul said to his counselors, "Look for a woman for me who can summon a spirit so that I can ask for instructions."
\p They replied, "There is a sorceress at Ein Dor."
\p
\v 8 Then Saul disguised himself as a common man and went out with two of his soldiers.
\p They met the sorcereress at night and Saul said to her, "Call the spirit of the man I will mention."
\p
\v 9 But the sorcereress replied, “Surely you know what King Saul did. He has driven the summoners and sorcerers from this land! Maybe you are setting me up so that I will be killed!"
\p
\v 10 But Saul swore to her in the name of the LORD, "In the name of the LORD who lives, you will not be found guilty in this matter!"
\p
\v 11 So the sorceress asked, "Whom shall I call?"
\p Saul said, "Call Samuel for me."
\p
\v 12 When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed out loud and shouted to Saul, “Why have you tricked me? You are King Saul!"
\p
\v 13 Saul said to her, “Don't be afraid! What do you see?"
\p The sorceress replied, “I see a spirit appearing from the ground! It looks like a divine spirit!"
\p
\v 14 Saul said to her, "How does it look?"
\p She answered, “An old man has appeared! He's wearing a robe!" When he realized that it was Samuel, Saul bowed briefly to honor him.
\p
\v 15 Samuel said to Saul, "Why are you bothering me by calling me here?" Saul replied, “I'm in deep trouble! The Philistines are at war against us and God has left me. God does not answer me anymore, whether through prophets or through dreams. So, I called you to tell me what to do."
\v 16 Samuel said, “It's useless if you ask me if the LORD has left you and become your enemy!
\v 17-18 The LORD has done what He already told you through me. But because you disobeyed him and did not return his wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD is doing this to you today, that is, he has taken this kingdom out of your hand and has given it to David.
\v 19 Moreover, the LORD will deliver you and the Israelites to the Philistines. Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me in death. The LORD will also hand the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines!”
\p
\v 20 At that instant Saul fell on the ground and was terrified by Samuel's words. His strength was lost because he had not eaten anything all day and night.
\p
\v 21 Then the woman approached Saul and saw how afraid he was. So the woman said to Saul, “Your servant has done what my Lord the King asked. I risked my life to do what you asked me.
\v 22 Now it is my Lord's turn to listen to the words of your servant! Let me give you something to eat. Thus my Lord will be strengthened for the journey back there."
\p
\v 23 But Saul refused and said, "I don't want to eat!" The two soldiers and the woman kept inviting him to eat until Saul did what they said. Then Saul got up from the ground and sat on the mattress.
\p
\v 24 The woman had a fat calf that she immediately slaughtered. She cooked some of the meat and also made bread without yeast.
\v 25 Then she served the food to Saul and his slaves, and they ate. After that, they got up and went home that very night.
