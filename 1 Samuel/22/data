\s David at the cave of Adullam and the city of Mizpah
\p
\v 1 Then David left Gath and fled to a cave in Adullam.\f + \fr 22:1 \fk Adullam \ft Adullam is a hilly area in the territory of Judah, about sixteen kilometers southwest of the city of Bethlehem, where David's family lived. The word Adullam itself means "refuge".\f* When his brothers and entire family heard the news, they came to him.
\v 2 All those who were in trouble, such as owing debt, or feeling dissatisfied with Saul's govern, came and joined David. Eventually David became leader of about four hundred men.
\p
\v 3 From that cave David went to the city of Mizpah in the region of Moab, and he said to the king of the Moabites, “Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God's will is for me.”\f \fr 22:3 \fk Moabites… \ft David's great-grandmother was a Moabite named Ruth. Look at Ruth 1:4; 4:13, 21-22. \f*
\v 4 So his parents lived with the king of Moab while David was in the cave.
\p
\v 5 But one day a prophet named Gad said to David, “Do not remain in this hiding place. Go back to the land of Judea." So David set out for the forest in Hereth.
\s Saul kills the priests in Nob
\p
\v 6 Saul immediately heard that David and those who joined him had moved into the territory of Judah. The news came while he was sitting under a tamarisk tree\f + \fr 22:6 \fk tamarisk \ft is a shrub that thrives in the Mediterranean region, its height can reach five meters. The tamarisk tree has sturdy branches and lush leaves, so it is often used as a place to rest.\f* on a hill in Gibea. Saul was holding his spear and was surrounded by his servants and bodyguards.
\p
\v 7 Saul said to his servants, “Listen, people of Benjamin! Did the son of Jesse promise to give each of you a field and a vineyard? Did he promise to make each of you a commander of an army of a thousand or a hundred soldiers?
\v 8 For I thought you had allied against me! T, none of you told me that my own son was on the side of the son of Jesse! It turns out that none of you have been merciful to me! Nobody told me that David along with his rebel party was looking for an opportunity to kill me, and my own son supported him!"
\p
\v 9 Doeg, the Edomite, was there with the rest of Saul's servants, saying, “When I was in the LORD's tabernacle in Nob, I saw the son of Jesse when he came to Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub.
\v 10 Ahimelech gave instructions from the LORD to David and provided food supplies. And he also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
\p
\v 11 Then Saul ordered to summon Ahimelech to appear before him, along with all his family who served as priests in Nob. So they all came to the king.
\v 12 Saul said to him, "Hear, O son of Ahitub!"
\p He replied, "I am ready, my lord."
\p
\v 13 Then Saul continued, “Why are you and that son of Jesse conspiredagainst me?! You gave him bread and a sword and asked for instructions from God for him, so that he rebelled against me. And today he is waiting for the time to kill me!"
\p
\v 14 Ahimelech replied to the king, “My lord, which of your servants is more faithful than David? He is your son-in-law and leader of your bodyguard troop, a person who is highly respected among your entire family!
\v 15 Yes, it is not the first time your servant has asked God for instructions for him! My lord, do not accuse me or my family members. For we don't know anything about all these matters."
\p
\v 16 But Saul said, "Ahimelech, you and all your family must die!"
\v 17 Then Saul commanded the guards who were beside him, “Kill the priests of the LORD, for they are on the side of David! They knew that David was running away, but they didn't tell me." But his guards refused to do anything to the priests of the LORD.
\p
\v 18 So the king said to Doeg, "Kill them!" So Doeg killed all the priests present. On that day he killed eighty-five priests who were wearing the linen ephod.
\v 19 Then Saul sentenced the city of Nob to destruction, which was a special city for priests. His troops carried out the punishment by killing everyone, both men and women, children and babies, even all cows, donkeys and sheep.
\p
\v 20 But one of the Ahimelech son, named Abiathar, succed to escape and joined David.
\v 21 He told David that Saul had killed the LORD's priests.
\v 22 So David said to Abiathar, "On that day in Nob, when I saw Doeg, the Edomite, present there, I realized that he would certainly tell Saul! So I am responsible for the death of your entire family!
\v 23 Join me. Do not be afraid! The king who wants to kill me, also wants to kill you. You are safe with me."
