\s1 Samuel anoints Saul
\p
\v 1 Then Samuel took a small jug filled with olive oil and poured it on top of Saul's head and hugged\f + \fr 10:1 \fk hugged \ft Literally, 'kissed. According to the Israeli people's tradition in ancient times and until now, Samuel may have kissed cheek near the ear. In this context, Samuel's kiss was a warm blessing with the meaning, "May you have success as king."\f* Saul while saying, "The LORD has chosen you to lead His people the Israelites! You will rule over the LORD's people and you will free them from the enemies pressure that is around them. This will be a sign for you that the LORD has chosen you as leader over the special people of His:
\v 2 After we part today, you will meet two men near Rachel's grave in Zelzah— the border of Benjamin's district. They will say to you, 'Your donkeys that disappeared have been found. Your father isn't worried about those donkeys any longer but has become worried about you and your servant! Your father keeps saying, 'What must I do to meet with my child?'"
\v 3 And again Samuel said, "From there you all will walk continuously until the large tree that is very well known as a place of worship in Tabor. There you all will meet with three men that are going to Bethel to offer sacrifices to God. A person will bring three young goats, another person will bring three round pieces of bread, and yet another person will bring a leather bag filled with wine.
\v 4 They will ask about your news and will give you two pieces of bread which you will receive.
\v 5 After that, you will go to the hill of God in Gibeah, the center of the Philistine soldiers' encampment. When you enter the city, you will meet a group of prophets who have just descended from the hill. They play harp, tambourine, flute and lyre while dancing and shouting.
\v 6 Then the Spirit of the LORD will descend on top of you and you will prophesy along with them. Your nature and character will change and become different than yourself at this time.
\v 7 When these things that I say happen to you, do whatever you think is best, because God is with you.
\v 8 You will go before me to Gilgal. We will meet there to offer burnt sacrifices and peace sacrifices. You have to wait as long as seven days until I arrive and tell you what you must do."\f + \fr 10:8 \fk wait \ft Even though Samuel had already anointed Saul as God's chosen sign, Samuel was still the primary leader and judge among all of the people of Israel. Because of that, Samuel had to inaugerate Saul before the assembly of Israelites. \f*
\s Saul becomes King
\p
\v 9 When Saul turned around and left Samuel, God changed all of Saul's character. All of the signs that Samuel said to him happened to Saul himself on that day also.
\v 10 When Saul and his servant arrived at the hill of God in Gibeah, a group of prophets came out and met with him. Then the Spirit of God descended on top of Saul and he prophesied with them.
\v 11 People who knew Saul from the past were amazed to see him prophesy with the prophets. Those people asked each other, "What happened to that child of Kish?! How is it that Saul can prophesy like a prophet?"
\v 12 Then a resident of Gibeah said, "Prophesying like them is not a matter of being born as the descendant of a prophet."\f + \fr 10:12 \fk Prophesying … a prophet. \ft Literally, "Who is their father?" This question apparently refers to other prophets that were prophesying. It's quite possible also that they— like Saul, were not descendants of prophets. So the TSI follows the interpretation like BIS/BIMK, CEV, and NLT.\f* Even so, because this event was quite surprising, so the question mentioned is often called, "How is it that Saul prophesies like a prophet?"
\v 13 After Saul was done prophesying, he climbed up the hill.
\v 14 Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where are you all going?" Saul answered, "To seek the donkeys that disappeared, but we didn't find them, so we met Samuel to ask for directions."
\v 15 Then his uncle asked Saul, "What did Samuel say to you?"
\v 16 Saul answered his uncle, "Samuel assured us that the donkeys would be found." But Saul didn't tell his uncle about the Samuel's word that he himself would become king over the Israelites.
\v 17 Then Samuel called the Israellites to gather before the LORD in Mizpah.
\v 18 Samuel said to Israel, "This is what the LORD our God said, 'I have brought Israel out of Egypt and set you all free from the oppression of Egyptians and all of the kingdom that made you all suffer greatly.
\v 19 But today you have rejected God who saved you all from all of your troubles and hardship. You all have said, 'No! Appoint a king over us.' Now, take your position before the LORD according to your tribes and families."
\v 20 Then Samuel invited all of the representatives of the tribes of Israel to come close to the front, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.
\p
\v 21 Then Samuel ordered the families of the tribe of Benjamin to move to the front, and the family of Matri was chosen. Then Samuel ordered the family of Matri to move to the front, and Saul the child of Kish was chosen, but when they looked for Saul, he wasn't there.
\p
\v 22 Then they asked instruction of the LORD, "Is Saul already here?" And the LORD answered, "Saul is hiding among the goods."
\v 23 Then they ran to meet Saul and brought him out from there. When Saul stood among the nation, he was taller than all of his countrymen. The Israelites in general were only as tall as Saul's shoulders.
\v 24 Samuel said to all of the people there, "This is the person chosen by the LORD. Truly, there isn't another person like him of all of our countrymen!" All of the people cried, "Live king!"
\v 25 Then Samuel explained to the public about the rights and responsibilites of the king. He wrote all of it on a parchment\f + \fr 10:25 \fk parchment \ft is a media used to write that is made of animal skin, usually the skin of a goat or sheep.\f* and placed it before the LORD. Then Samuel ordered all of the nation to go home to their own houses.
\v 26 Saul also went home to Gibeah. And along with him followed together several people who were gallant whose hearts were moved by God to follow with Saul.
\v 27 But several evil people said, "This person isn't possibly able to save us." They underestimated Saul and didn't bring gifts to Saul. But Saul pretended not to hear them.
