\s1 Samuel anoints Saul
\p
\v 1 Then Samuel took a small jug filled with olive oil and poured it above the head of Saul and hugged him \f + \fr 10:1 \fk hugged him \ft Literally, 'kissed. According to the Israeli people's tradition in ancient times and until now, Samuel may have kissed the cheek near to the ear. In this context, Samuel's kiss was a warm blessing with the meaning, "May you have success as king."\f* and said, "The LORD already chose you to lead His people, the nation of Israel! You will rule over the LORD's people and you will free them from the enemies power that is around them. This will be a sign for you that the LORD has chosen you as leader over the special people of His:
\v 2 After we separate today, you will meet two men near Rachel's grave in Zelzah, in the border of Benjamin's region. They will say to you, 'Your donkeys that disappeared have been found. Your father isn't worried about those donkeys any longer but has become worried about you! He keeps asking, 'What happened to my son?'"
\v 3 Then from there you will walk  continuously until  in the tree that is considered sacred in near to the Mountain Tabor. There you all will meet with three men that are travelling to Bethel to offer sacrifices to God. A person will bring three young goats, another person will bring three round loaves of bread, and yet another person will bring a leather bag filled with wine.
\v 4 They will ask your news and offer you two loaves of rounded bread. Receive that from them.
\v 5 After that, you will go to the hill of Gibeah, there will be a place od worship to God, and also a post guard of the Philistine. When you arrive in the city, you will meet with a group of prophets who have just come down from the place of worship. They will prophesy while playing the lute,  tambourine, flute and harp.
\v 6 Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you and you will prophesy along with them. Your traits and character will change and become different than yourself at this time.
\v 7  After this things that I say happen to you, do whatever according to you is good, because God is with you.
\v 8 You will go before me to Gilgal. We will meet there to offer burnt sacrifices and peace sacrifices. You have to wait  me as long as seven days until I arrive and tell you what you must do."\f + \fr 10:8 \fk to wait \ft Even though Samuel had already anointed Saul as God's chosen sign, Samuel still was the main leader and judge among all of the people of Israel. Therefore, Samuel had to officialize Saul before the nation of Israel. \f*
\s Saul becomes King
\p
\v 9 When Saul turned around and left Samuel, God changed all of Saul's character. All that signs that Samuel prophesied to him happened on that day also.
\v 10 When Saul and his slave arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met with him. Then the Spirit of God come upon Saul and he as well prophesied with them.
\v 11 People that knew Saul before were amazed to see him prophesy with the prophets. They asked each other, "What happened to the son of Kish?! How does Saul become a prophet?"
\v 12 Then a resident of Gibeah said, "Prophesying like them is not a matter of being born as the descendant of a prophet."\f + \fr 10:12 \fk Prophesying â€¦ a prophet. \ft Literally, "Who is their father?" This question apparently refers to other prophets that were prophesying. It's quite possible also that they like Saul, were not descendants of prophets. So the TSI follows the interpretation like BIS/BIMK, CEV, and NLT.\f* Nevertheless, because this event was quite surprising,  then this question mentioned is often said, "How Saul can become a prophet?"
\v 13 After Saul finished to prophesy, he climbed up to the worship place that in above hill in near there.
\v 14 Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where are you all coming from?" Saul answered, "To seek the donkeys that disappeared, but we didn't find them. So we met Samuel to ask for directions."
\v 15 His uncle asked again, "What did Samuel say to you?"
\v 16 Saul answered his uncle, "Samuel said that the donkeys were already found." But Saul didn't tell he will become king over the nation Israel.
\v 17 Then Samuel called the nation of Israel to gather before the LORD in Mizpah.
\v 18 Samuel said to the people of Israel, "This is what the LORD our God said, 'I have brought Israel out of Egypt and set you all free from the the hands of the people of Egypt and all of the kingdom that oppressed you.
\v 19 But today you have rejected God who saved you all from all of your troubles and hardship. You all have said, 'No! Appoint a king over us.' Now, take your position before the LORD according to your tribes and families."
\v 20 Then Samuel invited all of the representatives of the tribes of Israel to come close to the front, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.
\p
\v 21 Then Samuel ordered the families of the tribe of Benjamin to move to the front, and the family of Matri was chosen. Then Samuel ordered the family of Matri to move to the front, and Saul the child of Kish was chosen, but when they looked for Saul, he wasn't there.
\p
\v 22 Then they asked instruction of the LORD, "Is Saul already here?" And the LORD answered, "Saul is hiding among the goods."
\v 23 Then they ran to meet Saul and brought him out from there. When Saul stood among the nation, he was taller than all of his countrymen. The Israelites in general were only as tall as Saul's shoulders.
\v 24 Samuel said to all of the people there, "This is the person chosen by the LORD. Truly, there isn't another person like him of all of our countrymen!" All of the people cried, "Live king!"
\v 25 Then Samuel explained to the public about the rights and responsibilites of the king. He wrote all of it on a parchment\f + \fr 10:25 \fk parchment \ft is a media used to write that is made of animal skin, usually the skin of a goat or sheep.\f* and placed it before the LORD. Then Samuel ordered all of the nation to go home to their own houses.
\v 26 Saul also went home to Gibeah. And along with him followed together several people who were gallant whose hearts were moved by God to follow with Saul.
\v 27 But several evil people said, "This person isn't possibly able to save us." They underestimated Saul and didn't bring gifts to Saul. But Saul pretended not to hear them.
