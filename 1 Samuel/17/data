\s1 Goliath challenges the Israelites
\p
\v 1 Then the Philistines gathered their armies to fight the Israelites. They were preparing to attack the city of Socoh in the land of Judah. Their encampment began in the town of Socoh and reached the city of Azekah, which was in an area called Ephes Dammim.
\v 2 Saul also gathered the army of Israel and camped in the Valley of Elah. They prepared to face the Philistine forces.
\v 3 The Philistine army was on a hill and the Israelite army was on the hill next to it, with a valley stretching between them.p 
\v 4 Then out of the Philistine army came a war hero named Goliath the Gittite. He was three meters high.
\v 5 He wore a bronze helmet on his head, and wore bronze armor. The weight of the that armor was 57.5 kilograms.
\v 6 He wears a bronze covering on his feet and bears a javelin on his shoulder.
\v 7 The handle of the spear was as big as a weaver's beam, and the spear's eye weighed seven kilograms. The shield bearer walked in front of him.
\p
\v 8 Goliath stood up and shouted at the Israeli troops, "Why are you just standing in the line of battle?! Am I not a Philistine and you are Saul's servants? Choose one of you to fight me.
\v 9 If he is able to defeat and kill me, our nation will become your slaves. However, if I defeat and kill him, then your nation will be our slaves.
\v 10 I challenge the Israeli army today! Give me just one person so we can fight one on one. "
\v 11 When Saul and all the Israelites heard Goliath's words, they were very worried and afraid.
\s1 David was at King Saul's camp
\p
\v 12 David was the son of Jesse, one of the Euphrates families who came from Bethlehem, the tribe of Judah. Jesse has eight sons. When Saul became king, Jesse was very old.
\v 13-14 The three oldest children of Jesse, Eliab, Abinadab, and Shama, went to war with Saul. And David is the youngest.
\v 15 David often commuted from Saul's camp to Bethlehem to herd his father's sheep.
\p
\v 16 But every morning and evening for forty days, Goliath continued to challenge the Israeli army very arrogantly.
\p
\v 17 One day Jesse said to David, "My child, hurry up and bring ten kilograms of roasted wheat and ten loaves of bread to your brothers in the camp.
\v 18 Also give ten of these cheeses to their commander. Look at the situation of your brothers and bring the letter they wrote for me. "
\v 19 At that time Saul and the army of Israel were still in the valley of Elah ready to fight the Philistines.
\p
\v 20 The next day, David got up early and left his flock to a guard. Then he went to bring the food, as his father had instructed him. When David arrived at the Israeli camp, the troops were arranging their battle lines while shouting the battle cry.
\v 21 The Israeli army and the Philistine forces have arranged their line. They face each other and are ready to fight.
\v 22 David handed the food over to the chief of supplies, then he ran to the battlefield to meet his brothers.
\v 23 While David was talking to them, Goliath came out of the champion of the Philistine army. He shouted to insult and challenge Israel as was his custom. David also heard it.
\p
\v 24 When Israeli troops saw Goliath, they began to run scared.
\v 25 An Israeli soldier said, "Have you seen that giant man?! Every day he comes out to insult us. The king had promised that those who succeeded in killing him would be given abundant wealth, and also the daughter of King Saul would be his wife. He and his family will also be exempt from tax.‚Äù
\p
\v 26 David said, "Who is the idol worshiper, so that he is left to continue to insult the living God and his army?!" Then he asked the others who were standing near him, "What will be given to the person who killed the Philistines and removes the insult to Israel?"
\p
\v 27 They told him the same thing, like the words he had just heard by affirming, "Yes, those are the gifts for the person who killed him."
\p
\v 28 When Eliab, his oldest brother, heard David talking to them, Eliab became angry with David and said, "Why did you come here?! Who is guarding our father's flock in the wilderness?! I know the pride and evil of your heart! You came here just to see this war! "
\p
\v 29 Then David answered, "What is my fault? I just asked them! "
\v 30 Then David left Eliab and approached several others. He asked the same thing and get the same answer too.
\v 31 Finally, David's words were conveyed to King Saul, and the king called David.
\s1 David killed Goliath
\p
\v 32 David said to Saul, "Let no one be discouraged by Goliath. Your servant will go against that Philistine. "
\p
\v 33 But Saul answered, "There is no way you can defeat him, because you are still young, whereas he has been used to fighting since his youth."
\p
\v 34 Then David said to Saul, "Your servant is used to pasturing my father's flock. When a lion or a bear comes, and poisons a sheep,
\v 35 then the servant chased and struck him, then released the sheep from his mouth. When he attacks me, I catch his jaw, then beat him to death.
\v 36 I have killed both lions and bears, and I will treat the idolaters as animals, for he has insulted the living God and his army.
\v 37 The Lord who has delivered me from the claws of a lion and a bear will also deliver me from the hands of the Philistines. " Then Saul answered, "Go, and may the Lord be with you."
\p
\v 38 Then Saul put his armor on David, and put a copper cap on his head and put on his armor.
\v 39 David fastened his sword on the outside to his armor, and tried to walk a few steps, because he had never before worn armor. Then David said to Saul, "I cannot walk in these clothes, because I have never worn them." Then David removed all the equipment.
\v 40 After that, David took his staff and went to the river, chose five slippery stones and put them in his bag. Holding a sling, he went to where Goliath was.
\p
\v 41 Goliath walked closer to David, and in front of him was his shield bearer.
\v 42 Goliath looked and insulted him, because David was young, reddish, and beautiful.
\v 43 Goliath shouted at David, "You think of me as a dog, so you come to me with a piece of wood?!" Then he cursed David on behalf of his gods.
\v 44 Goliath challenged David, "Come forward! Oppose me and I will give your flesh to birds and wild animals. "
\p
\v 45 But David answered, "You come to me with swords, spears and javelins. But I come to you in the name of the LORD Almighty, that is the God of Israel, whom you despised.
\v 46 Today the LORD will deliver you into my hands, and I will defeat you and cut off your head. Your bodies and the corpses of the Philistine soldiers will become food for birds and wild animals, so that the whole world knows that Israel serves the living God.
\v 47 And every army gathered here will know that the Lord does not need swords and spears to save His people. Because this war is under the Lord's own authority. He will surrender all your troops to our hands. "
\p
\v 48 When Goliath came forward to attack again, David ran quickly to face him.
\v 49 David took a stone from his bag and put it in his sling. Then he swung the sling and threw the stone right at its target. The stone sank on Goliath's forehead, so he fell face to face with the ground.
\p
\v 50 Thus David defeated and killed Goliath with only a sling and a stone, without holding a sword.
\v 51 Then David ran to the place where Goliath fell, pulled Goliath's sword from its scabbard, and then cut off his head.
\s1 Israeli forces defeated the Philistine forces When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they fled.
\p
\v 52 Israel and Judah troops shouted and pursued the Philistine forces near the city of Gath and the gates of Ekron. The bodies of the Philistines lay along the road from Saaraim to Gath and Ekron.
\v 53 After the Israeli army returned from pursuing enemy troops, they looted the Philistine camp.
\v 54 David took the head of Goliath which he had beheaded and brought it to Jerusalem, while keeping the armor of Goliath in his tent.
\p
\v 55 As Saul watched David come forth against Goliath, he said to Abner, the commander of his army, "Whose son is the young man?"
\p Abner answered, "My lord, in fact I do not know either."
\p
\v 56 The king gave orders, "Seek information from those who know him: Who is his father?"
\p
\v 57 Then, while David was still holding Goliath's head, Abner brought David to King Saul.
\v 58 Ask Saul to David, "Whose son are you?" David answered, "I am the son of your servant Jesse, the Bethlehemite."
