\c 13
\s1 The battle continues against the Philistines
\p
\v 1 Saul was an adult\f + \fr 13:1 \fk adult \ft In the Masoretic Text the number of years indicating Saul's age has disappeared. Only a few texts from the Septuagint say about 30 years old. The Masoretic text also does not say how many years Saul reigned. Usually the translation of the Bible follows the 'how many years' information given to him to govern, see Acts. 13:21.\f* when he began to rule as king, and he ruled the nation of Israel for about forty years.
\p
\v 2 From the army of Israel that had defeated Ammon, Saul chose three thousand people from the nation of Israel to become an army that remained ready to fight. And he ordered those who were not chosen to return to their respective homes. Of the three thousand soldiers, two thousand served with him in Micmash and the entire hilly area of Bethel. Another thousand people were on duty with Jonathan, his son, in Gibeah, in the territory of Benjamin.
\p
\v 3 Then Jonathan and his army attacked and destroyed the Philistine army post at Geba.\f +\fr 13:3 \fk Geba \ft The city of Geba is located between the two cities of Gibea and Michmash.\f* News of the attack was heard by other Philistines. Therefore, Saul sent messengers with the command, "Go all over Israel. Ring the trumpet and shout, 'Let all the people stand by!'"
\v 4 So all the Israelites heard, "Saul has defeated the Philistine army post in Geba. Thus the Philistines must really hate the Israelites." So the Israelite army was told to gather and follow Saul at Gilgal.
\p
\v 5 Meanwhile, the Philistine army had gathered to attack the Israelites at Michmash, which was east of Beth Aven. They came with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and a large army of foot soldiers, like sand on the beach.
\v 6 When the Israelites saw that they had been pushed back by an enemy that was larger in number, many of the Israelite soldiers hid in caves, among thick bushes, in crevices between large rocks, in deep holes in the ground, and in dry wells.
\v 7 There were even soldiers who fled until they crossed the Jordan River then headed to the territory of Gad and Gilead.
\s Saul's disobedience and Samuel's rebuke
\p Meanwhile, Saul himself was still in Gilgal along with members of his army who were trembling in fear.
\v 8 Saul waited seven days, according to the time determined by Samuel. But on the seventh day Samuel had not yet come to Gilgal. Saul realized that many of his troops were leaving him.
\v 9 Finally Saul said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the thanksgiving sacrifice." Then Saul himself offered the burnt offering to ask the LORD for help.
\p
\v 10 Once Saul had finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived at Gilgal, and Saul left the altar to welcome him.
\v 11 But Samuel said, "What have you done?!"
\p Saul answered, "I saw the soldiers starting to leave me, and you did not come according to the time you set. Moreover the Philistine army had gathered at Michmash.
\v 12 Therefore, I thought, ‘The Philistines will attack us in Gilgal and I have not yet asked for the LORD's blessing.’ So I felt I had to offer a burnt sacrifice."
\p
\v 13 Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted very foolishly! The LORD has commanded you to destroy the enemy! Indeed, if you obey His commands, the LORD has planned to establish your kingdom over Israel forever!
\v 14 But now, your kingdom will not last. Therefore, the LORD has chosen a person who is pleasing in His heart, and has appointed that person to be king over His people, because you disobeyed the commandments that the LORD gave you."
\s A dangerous situation for Israeli troops
\p
\v 15-16 Samuel left Saul at Gilgal. Philistine troops camped at Michmash. Then Saul brought all the soldiers who were still with him from Gilgal to join the army led by Jonathan in Gibeah, in the territory of Benjamin. When the numbers were counted, there were only about six hundred people.
\v 17 Philistine soldiers sent three groups from Michmash with the task of plundering. One group went to Ophrah in the Shual area.
\v 18 Another group headed to Beth Horon. And the other group headed to the border overlooking the Zeboim valley towards the wilderness.
\p
\v 19 At that time no one from Israel was a blacksmith, because the Philistines said, "Don't let Israel make swords and spears."
\v 20 Thus, all Israelites were forced to go to the Philistines if they wanted to sharpen their plowshares, pickaxes, axes and sickles.
\v 21 They had to pay 8 grams of silver to sharpen plows or pickaxes, and 4 grams of silver to sharpen axes, sickles, and stick tips to control cattle.
\v 22 So on the day of battle no one on the side of the Israelites had a sword or spear, except Saul and Jonathan.
\s Jonathan's courage against the Philistine army
\p
\v 23 Meanwhile, the Philistines had sent a group of their guards to the mountain crossing in Michmash.
