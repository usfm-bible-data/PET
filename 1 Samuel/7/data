\v 1 Then the residents of Kiriath Jearim came and took the LORD's chest of promise. They brought the chest to the house of Abinadab that was located on a hill. Then they purified Eleazarâ€” son of Abinadab to become the guardian of the LORD's Chest of Promise.
\s1 The Israelites return to war with the Philistines
\p
\v 2 The LORD's Chest of Promise was two years in Kiriath Jearim, however during that time also all of the Israelites mourned and cried out asking the LORD for help, because He for so long had allowed Israel to still be colonized by the Philistines.\f + \fr 7:2 \fk because... colonized \ft This phrase is implicit information that is made explicit in the TSI. See Judges 13:1\f*
\v 3 Then Samuel said to all of the Israelites, "If you all truly want to return to worshipping the LORD with [your//] whole hearts, then throw away all of the foreign gods and statues of Ashtoreth that are among you all. Be truly devoted to the LORD and serve only Him, then He will free you all from the colonization of the Phillistines."
\v 4 Then the Israelites threw away the foreign god statues and the statues of Ashtoreth from their area, and served only the LORD.
\p
\v 5 Then Samuel said, "Gather all of the Israelites to Mizpah, then I will pray to the LORD for you all."
\v 6 After the Israelites gathered at Mizpah, they took water and poured it out as a sign of repentance that truly symbolized their souls which were surrendered to the LORD. All day long they fasted and truly confessed, "We have sinned against the LORD."
\p In this place Samuel begins to become judge for the Israelites.
\p
\v 7 When the Philistines heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, then the five kings of the Philistines gathered their troops, and went to attack the Israelites. When they heard that the Philistine army was coming, all of Israel was afraid.
\v 8 They said to Samuel, "Pray continuously to the LORD our God, so that He helps and saves us from the attack of the Philistines!"
\v 9 Then Samuel took a lamb that was still nursing and offered it entirely as a burnt sacrifice to the LORD. Samuel prayed to the LORD for the Israelites, and the LORD heard him.
\p
\v 10 At the time Samuel offered the burnt sacrifice, the Philistines approached to attack the Israelites. But at that time also, the LORD sent a load roar from the sky in the area of the Philistines, so that they became panicked, and the Israelites defeated them.
\v 11 The Israelites went out from Mizpah to chase the Philistines, killed and defeated them to downstream of Beth-car.
\s1 Making peace with Israel's enemies, and Samuel's service
\p
\v 12 Samuel raised a large tall stone and placed it between Mizpah and Shen. He named that monument Ebenezer, because he said, "Until now the LORD has helped us."
\p
\v 13 In that way the Philistines were defeated, they didn't attack the Israelites any more. The LORD continued to help the Israelites defeat the Philistines in battle as long as Samuel lived.
\v 14 The Israelites succeed to take back all of the cities that had previously been taken by the Philistines, starting with the city of Ekron up to Gath. In that way the Israelites were able to return to all of their districts. Peace also happened between the Israelites and the Amorites.
\p
\v 15 Samuel ruled as a judge over the Israelites until he died.
\v 16 Every year Samuel went around from Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah. In each city Samuel settled cases that happened among the Israelites.
\v 17 Then Samuel returned to his house in Ramah. There Samuel became judge and settled cases among the Israelites. There he raised an altar to the LORD.
