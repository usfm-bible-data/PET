\s1 Samuel dies
\p
\v 1 Not long after that Samuel died, and all the people of Israel gathered together and mourned for him. They buried him in his home in Rama.
\s Nabal angered David
\p After that David moved again to the wilderness in the area of Maon. \f + \fr 25: 1 \fk Maon \ft The Masoretic text has 'Paran'. The TSI and various other translations choose that it is more appropriate to follow the Septuagint, which has Maon. This also fits the storyline in the following verses. \f*
\v 2-3 There is a man from the tribe of Kaleb, named Nabal, \f + \fr 25: 2-3 \fk Nabal \ft The meaning of the name Nabal is 'stupid' or 'no sense of mind'.\f* stay in the same area and owns land near the city of Carmel. \f + \fr 25: 3 \fk city of Carmel \ft The city of Carmel is located in the north near the city of Maon. This city is also called in 1Sam. 15:12 and Joshua 15:55. Mount Carmel is another place.\f* He was a very wealthy man, who owned 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. At that time he was in Carmel shearing his sheep. Nabal has a wife named Abigail. Abigail was wise and beautiful, while her husband was rude and his actions were evil.
\p
\v 4 When David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
\v 5 then David sent ten men from his army saying, "Go to Nabal in Carmel and give him my greetings.
\v 6 Tell him this, 'I wish you prosperity, your family, and all that belongs to you.
\v 7 I heard that your workers are shearing your sheep. When your shepherds were with us in Carmel, we never bothered them, and they never lost anything while there.
\v 8 Ask them, because they can be a witness for you about our behavior! On the day of this feast, let us be pleasing to your eyes and considered like your servants. Give us, your servants and your son David, whatever is left of your party. '"
\v 9 So David's messengers went to deliver all these messages to Nabal and waited for his answer.
\p
\v 10 But Nabal answered, "Did David the son of Jesse think who he was? In this age there are many like him, who are merely slaves who rebel against their masters!
\v 11 Shall I take my bread, my water, and my lamb \f + \fr 25:11 \fk my bread, my water, my lamb \ft all things that he calls have my last word, showing how stingy and greedy he is.\f* I slaughtered to feed my sheep-cutters and give it to a group like you? I don't even know where you came from! ”
\p 12 So the messengers returned to David and said all that Nabal had said.
\v 13 So David said to his whole army, "O all of you, prepare your sword and put it on your loins!" So David and his troops prepared and took their swords. About four hundred people followed David, while another two hundred stayed to guard their belongings.
\p
\v 14 But one of Nabal's shepherds told Abigail, Nabal's wife, “David sent a messenger from the wilderness to give blessings to Lord Nabal, but he insulted them.
\v 15 But David's army was very kind to us. They did not disturb us, and not one of our possessions was lost while we were with them in the fields.
\v 16 Both day and night, they are like strongholds that guard us while we are tending the sheep.
\v 17 Think and act immediately. Because calamity is approaching Nabal and it could destroy his entire family. Master is very annoying! He will not listen to any advice from anyone! ”
\p 18 So Abigail hurriedly sent his slaves to two hundred loaves of bread, two bags of wine, five lambs that had been slaughtered, thirty liters of roasted wheat, one hundred packets of raisins, and two hundred figs. They wrapped the things, and put them on the donkeys.
\v 19 Then Abigail said to them, “Go ahead of me. I will follow you. " But he didn't tell Nabal about his actions.
\p
\v 20 Abigail was riding a donkey on the winding road in the hills. At that very moment, ahead of him, David and his army were traveling down the same road, so that they met.
\v 21 David had just said, “I am in vain to protect all this flock in the wilderness! There wasn't a single thing my troops stole from him. But he repaid my good deeds with evil!
\v 22 Let Allah punish me, even take my life, if I let a man who lives in Nabal's house still be alive until tomorrow morning! "
\p
\v 23 When Abigail saw David, she immediately got down from her donkey and bowed down before David.
\v 24 At David's feet, Abigail said, “My lord, let me bear the wrongs that have happened! Therefore, let your servant speak to you! Please listen to the words of your servant!
\v 25 My lord, pay no attention to Nabal, the evil man. His behavior really lives up to his name, which is 'fool'. He sure is stupid! But apologize, your servant did not see the Lord's messengers.
\p 26 "Therefore, I say before the LORD who lives and before my Lord: The LORD Himself holds back my Lord's hand, so that my Lord does not repay Nabal's wickedness or kill anyone, let the LORD punish Nabal alone! And let all the Lord's enemies have the fate of Nabal!
\v 27 Let this gift that I bring please my lord and all who follow you.
\v 28 Forgive the guilt of your servant, for the LORD will certainly build up your family and make them strong descendants, because the LORD has appointed you to lead his people in warfare against his enemies. Therefore, let the Lord not be accused of any crime in your lifetime!
\p
\v 29 "If someone pursues and wants to kill you, then your life will always be protected by the Lord your God, as if He had wrapped you in a special place. But let the life of your enemies take away, like a stone that is thrown with a sling!
\v 30 Thus, when the LORD kept every promise he had to the Lord, and he made my lord king of Israel,
\v 31 your conscience will not be burdened with guilt because your own hands quickly take revenge or shed people's blood without honest reason. And when the Lord has fulfilled all these good things for you, please remember your servant. "
\p
\v 32 David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me!
\v 33 Praise the Lord for the wisdom given to you! May you also be blessed by Him, because today you prevented me from taking revenge and shedding people's blood with my own hands!
\v 34 For I have sworn before the LORD the living God of Israel, who has prevented me from hurting you: If you had not come quickly to meet me, then at dawn there would not have been a man living in Nabal's house. life!"
\v 35 So David took all the gifts that Abigail brought. David said to her, “Go back to your house feeling calm. Rest assured that I have listened to you and have agreed to your request. "
\p
\v 36 When Abigail returned to Nabal, Nabal was having a big banquet at his house, which was as luxurious as a feast thrown by a king. Nabal had fun and was very drunk. So Abigail didn't tell him anything until the next day.
\v 37 In the morning, when Nabal woke up, Abigail told him everything that had happened. Nabal was immediately hit by a heart attack and his body became rigid.
\v 38 About ten days after this incident, the Lord punished Nabal and he died.
\s David married Abigail
\p
\v 39 When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Praise the Lord, who has prevented me from taking revenge for the insult I received from Nabal! God has repaid Nabal for his sin. " So David sent messengers to Abigail to beg him to become his wife.
\p
\v 40 When the messengers arrived in Carmel, they said to Abigail, "David sent us to ask you to be his wife."
\p
\v 41 So Abigail bowed down and said, "I am his servant, and I am willing to wash the feet of my master's servants."
\v 42 Abigail immediately prepared herself, and climbed onto her donkey, accompanied by her five female slaves. He followed David's messengers. Then she became one of David's wives.
\v 43 Before marrying Abigail, David had also married Ahinoam of Yisreel.
\v 44 Whereas Saul's daughter Mikal, who was David's first wife, had already been given by Saul to a Galim named Paltiel, \f + \fr 25:44 \fk Paltiel \ft Paltiel's name is spelled 'Palti' in this verse in the Hebrew text . Meanwhile, at 2Sam. 3:15 the name is spelled completely. The name Paltiel means "salvation of Allah".\f* son of Lais.
