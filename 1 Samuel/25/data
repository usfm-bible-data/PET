\s1 Samuel dies
\p
\v 1 Not long after that Samuel died, and all the people of Israel gathered together and mourned for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah.
\s Nabal makes David angry
\p After that David moved again to the wilderness in the area of Maon.\f + \fr 25:1 \fk Maon \ft The Masoretic text has 'Paran'. The TSI and various other translations have chosen that it is more appropriate to follow the Septuagint, which has Maon. This also fits the storyline in the following verses. \f*
\v 2-3 There was a man from the tribe of Caleb, named Nabal,\f + \fr 25:2-3 \fk Nabal \ft The meaning of the name Nabal is 'stupid' or 'no sense of mind'.\f* who lived in the same area and owned land near the city of Carmel.\f + \fr 25:3 \fk city of Carmel \ft The city of Carmel is located in the north near the city of Maon. This city is also mentioned in 1 Sam. 15:12 and Joshua 15:55. Mount Carmel is a different place.\f* He was a very wealthy man, who owned 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. At that time he was in Carmel shearing his sheep. Nabal had a wife named Abigail. Abigail was wise and beautiful, while her husband was rude and his actions were evil.
\p
\v 4 When David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
\v 5 then David sent ten men from his army saying, "Go to Nabal in Carmel and give him my greetings.
\v 6 Tell him this, 'I wish prosperity for you Sir, your family, and all that belongs to you.
\v 7 I heard that your workers are shearing your sheep. When your shepherds were with us in Carmel, we never bothered them, and they never lost anything while there.
\v 8 Ask them, because they can be a witness for you about our behavior! On the day of this feast, let us be pleasing to your eyes and considered like your servants. Give us, your servants and your son David, whatever is left of your party.'"
\v 9 So David's messengers went to deliver the whole message to Nabal and waited for his answer.
\p
\v 10 But Nabal answered, "Did David the son of Jesse think about who he is? In this age there are many like him, who are merely slaves who rebel against their masters!
\v 11 Shall I take my bread, my water, and my lamb\f + \fr 25:11 \fk my bread, my water, my lamb \ft all the things that he mentions are modified with 'my', showing how stingy and greedy he is.\f* that I slaughtered to feed my sheep shearers and give it to a group like you? I don't even know where you came from!”
\p
\v 12 So the messengers returned to David and conveyed all that Nabal had said.
\v 13 So David said to his whole army, "All of you, prepare your sword and put it on your loins!" So David and his troops prepared and took their swords. About four hundred people followed David, while another two hundred stayed to guard their belongings.
\p
\v 14 But one of Nabal's shepherds told Abigail, Nabal's wife, “David sent a messenger from the wilderness to give blessings to master Nabal, but instead he insulted them.
\v 15 But David's army was very kind to us. They did not disturb us, and not one of our possessions was lost while we were with them in the fields.
\v 16 Both day and night, they were like strongholds that guarded us while we were tending the sheep.
\v 17 Think and act immediately. For calamity is approaching Nabal and it could destroy his entire family. Master is very irritating! He will not listen to any advice from anyone!”
\p
\v 18 So Abigail hurriedly sent her slaves to take two hundred loaves of bread, two wineskins, five lambs that had been slaughtered, thirty liters of roasted wheat, one hundred packets of raisins, and two hundred fig cakes. They wrapped the items, and put them on the donkeys.
\v 19 Then Abigail said to them, “Go ahead of me. I will follow you." But she didn't tell Nabal about her actions.
\p
\v 20 Abigail was riding a donkey on the winding road in the hills. At that very moment, ahead of her, David and his army were walking down the same road, so that they met.
\v 21 David had just said, “It was useless for me to protect this whole flock in the wilderness! There wasn't a single thing my troops stole from him. But he repaid my good deeds with evil!
\v 22 Let God punish me, even take my life, if I let a man who lives in Nabal's house remain alive until tomorrow morning!"
\p
\v 23 When Abigail saw David, she immediately got down from her donkey and bowed down before David.
\v 24 At David's feet, Abigail said, “My lord, let me bear the wrongs that have happened! Therefore, let your servant speak to you! Please listen to the words of your servant!
\v 25 My lord, pay no attention to Nabal, that evil man. His behavior really lives up to his name, which is 'fool'. He sure is stupid! But I apologize, your servant did not see your messengers earlier.
\p
\v 26 "Therefore, I say before the LORD who lives and before you: The LORD Himself held back your hand, so that you would not repay Nabal's wickedness or kill anyone, let the LORD alone punish Nabal! And let all the your enemies have the fate of Nabal!
\v 27 Let this gift that your servant has brought please my lord and all who follow you.
\v 28 Forgive the guilt of your servant, for the LORD will certainly build up your family and establish your descendants, because the LORD has appointed you to lead his people in warfare against his enemies. Therefore, let my lord not be accused of any evil in your lifetime!
\p
\v 29 "If someone pursues and wants to kill you, then your life will always be protected by the LORD your God, as if He had bundled you in a special place. But let the life of your enemies be taken away, like a stone that is thrown with a sling!
\v 30 Thus, when the LORD has kept every promise he has made to you Sir, and he makes my lord king of Israel,
\v 31 your conscience will not be burdened with guilt because your own hands quickly took revenge or shed people's blood without an honest reason. And when the LORD has fulfilled all these good things for you, please remember your servant."
\p
\v 32 David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me!
\v 33 Praise the LORD for the wisdom given to you! May you also be blessed by Him, because today you prevented me from taking revenge and shedding people's blood with my own hands!
\v 34 For I have sworn before the LORD, the living God of Israel, who has prevented me from hurting you: If you had not come quickly to meet me, then at dawn there would not have been a man still alive in Nabal's house!"
\v 35 So David took all the gifts that Abigail brought. David said to her, “Go back to your house feeling calm. Rest assured that I have listened to you and have agreed to your request."
\p
\v 36 When Abigail returned to Nabal, Nabal was having a big banquet at his house, which was as luxurious as a feast thrown by a king. Nabal had fun and was very drunk. So Abigail didn't tell him anything until the next day.
\v 37 In the morning, when Nabal woke up, Abigail told him everything that had happened. Nabal was immediately struck with a heart attack and his body became rigid.
\v 38 About ten days after this incident, the LORD punished Nabal and he died.
\s David marries Abigail
\p
\v 39 When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Praise the LORD, who has prevented me from taking revenge for the insult I received from Nabal! The LORD has repaid Nabal for his sin." So David sent messengers to Abigail to ask her to become his wife.
\p
\v 40 When the messengers arrived in Carmel, they said to Abigail, "David sent us to ask you to be his wife."
\p
\v 41 So Abigail bowed down and said, "I am his servant, and I am willing to wash the feet of my master's servants."
\v 42 Abigail immediately prepared herself, and climbed onto her donkey, accompanied by her five female slaves. She followed David's messengers. Then she became one of David's wives.
\v 43 Before marrying Abigail, David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel.
\v 44 Whereas Saul's daughter Michal, who was David's first wife, had already been given by Saul to a man from Gallim named Paltiel,\f + \fr 25:44 \fk Paltiel \ft Paltiel's name is spelled 'Palti' in this verse in the Hebrew text, while at 2 Sam. 3:15 the name is spelled out completely. The name Paltiel means "salvation of God".\f* son of Laish.
