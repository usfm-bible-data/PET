\s1 The Philistines take the Chest of Promise
\p
\v 1 The Israelites fought against the Philistines. The Israelites camped in Ebenezer, and the Philistines camped in Aphek.
\v 2 The Philistines arranged their army to fight against the Israelites. When the battle got fiercer, the Philistines could defeat the Israelites. The Philistine soldiers killed about four thousand Israelite soldiers on the battle field.
\v 3 When the soldiers returned to the camp, the elders of the Israelites asked, "Why did the LORD allow the Philistines to defeat us today? Let's take the LORD's Chest of Promise from Shiloh. When that chest is with us, that chest will certainly save us from the hands of our enemy.
\v 4 Because of that, several soldiers were sent to Shiloh to take the Chest of Promise of the LORD Commander of the Universe who is enthroned above the cherubim. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas came with the LORD's Chest of Promise to the camp.
\v 5 When the LORD's Chest of Promise arrived in the camp, all of the troops and the elders of Israel shouted so loudly that the ground shook.
\v 6 The Philistine troops heard the shouts and said, "Why are loud shouts heard in the camp of the Hebrew people?
\v 7 When the Philistine troops realized that situation, they became fearful and panicked because they thought, "The gods have come to the camp of the troops of Israel! This is really bad for us! We've never seen something like this!
\v 8 We're doomed! Who can free us from the hands of their mighty gods? These gods that destroyed the people of Egypt with different epidemics of disease in the wilderness!
\v 9 But, remain strong and act like men, you Philistines, or you will become the slaves of the Hebrew people like they have become our slaves! Let us act like men who are valiant and make war!
\p
\v 10 So when they fought again, the Philistine troops defeated the troops of Israel. A great many Israeli soldiers died, up to thirty thousand Israeli soldiers were killed. The Israeli soldiers ran off home.
\v 11 The LORD's Chest of Promise was taken by the Philistines, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas were killed.
\s The Priest Eli dies
\v 12 On that day a person from the tribe of Benjamin ran away from the lines of battle to Shiloh. His clothing was torn and his head was full of dust.
\v 13 When he arrived in Shiloh, Eli was sitting on a bench observing from the side of the road, because he was very worried about the situation of the LORD's Chest of Promise. When that person entered the city to give a report, the whole city cried loudly.
\v 14 Then Eli heard the crying, and he said, "What is this sound of commotion?" The person quickly came and told Eli.
\v 15 The age of Eli at that time was ninety eight years old and his eyes couldn't see clearly.
\v 16 That person said to Eli, "I've just come from the battle field! I managed to run away from the battle!" Eli asked, "How is the situation in the battle field, child?"
\v 17 The message bearer said, "The Israelites ran away from before the Philistines! The soldiers experienced a great defeat! Your two children, Hophni and Phinehas, died! The LORD's Chest of Promise was taken away by the Philistines!"
\v 18 When that person mentioned the LORD's Chest of Promise, Eli fell backwards from his seat beside the gate door. His neck broke and he died, because he was very old and fat. He had been a judge for the people of Israel for forty years.
\v 19 His daughter-in-law, wife of Phinehas, was far along pregnant and almost to give birth. When she heard the news that the LORD's Chest of Promise had been taken by force by the Philistines and her father-in-law along with her husband had died, then she labored and gave birth. However her labor pains felt too great for her.
\v 20 When she was dying, the person who helped her give birth said, "Don't be afraid! You've just birthed a boy child!" But she didn't answer or pay attention to those words.
\v 21 Phinehas' wife named the child Ichabod, because she said, "The glory of God is gone from Israel." She said that because the LORD's Chest of Promise had been taken and because of the death of her father-in-law and her husband.
\v 22 Once more the wife of Phinehas said again, "The glory of God is gone from Israel, because the LORD's Chest of Promise has been taken by the Philistines."
