\p
\v 1 When he was old, Samuel appointed his two sons to replace him as judges for the nation of Israel.
\v 2 The firstborn was named Joel and the youngest Abijah. They became judges in Beersheba.
\v 3 But they did not  establish justice,  because of doing corruption and receiving bribe. They did nor follow the example of heir father.
\p
\v 4 Because of that, the leaders of the Israel gathered together and approached Samuel in Ramah.
\v 5 They said to him, "We ask Sir to listen to us, Sir is already old, and both of two son's of Sir don't follow Sir example. So now, appoint a king for us. The king that will lead us, so that we will be like other nations around us."
\p
\v 6 But Samuel did no really agreed with their request, then he prayed asking direction from the LORD.
\v 7 The LORD said to him, "Do whatever they request. I am the one they reject as their king, its not you!\f + \fr 8:7 \fk I am the one they reject \ft The Israelites request didn't just make Samuel sad, but also God also was sad, evenin Deut. 17:14-20, the LORD already determine requirement appointment of a king to rule over them.\f*
\v 8 Since I led them out of Egypt until now, they left Me and worshiped various gods. What they have done to me, they have done just the same to you!
\v 9 Do whatever they request. But warn them with sincere, about how the king will rule over them."
\s Samuel warns the Israelites
\p
\v 10 Said the Lord to Samuel so he conveyed to the elders that asked him to lift up a king.
\v 11 He said, "This is what a king will do who will rule over each one of you all: He will oblige your children to become soldiers. Some will assigned as soldiers of chariot drivers and horsemen soldiers. Some other will became soldiers that  run in front of the chariot of his troops.
\v 12 There will be others that lifted as leaders over one thousand soldier, or above fifty. there will be also that  slave to plow his field, harvest his crop, and make weapons of war and chariot tools.
\v 13 The king will take your daughters and make them as slaves that work as perfume makers, chef, and bakers.
\v 14 Continuing he will take your best land,  including your fields, your vineyards, and field of olive of yours, then he will give it to his own officials.
\v 15 the King also will take ten percent of the wheat produced and your grapes and give it to his officials.
\v 16 He also will take your servants, both male and female, also your best cows and your donkeys for his personal interests.
\v 17 He will take ten percent from your flocks of livestock, and you all yourselves will become his servants.
\v 18 And will come the day when you all cry out asking help of the LORD because of the king you all chose, the LORD won't answer you all."
\v 19 But they that were present refused Samuel's warning. They said, "Even though  we still want a king to rule over us!
\v 20 In that way our nation will be like other nations. Our king will govern above us and lead us in war."
\p
\v 21 hearing everything that they said, then Samuel btold it to the LORD.
\v 22 Said the LORD  to him, "Do like taht they said, and consacrate a king that will rule over them." Then Samuel agreed to their request and said, "Return all of you to each of your cities."
