\c 8 The Israelites look for a King
\p
\v 1 When he was old, Samuel appointed his two sons to replace him as judges for the Israelites.
\v 2 Their names were Joel and Abijah. They became judges in Beersheba.
\v 3 However Joel and Abijah didn't follow Samuel's example. On the other hand, they acted corruptly, received bribes and didn't uphold justice.
\v 4 Because of that, all of the tribal leaders of the Israelites gathered together and approached Samuel in Ramah.
\v 5 They said to him, "We ask Father to listen to us, Father is already old, and Father's two son's don't follow Father's example. So now, appoint a king for us. That king will lead us, so that we are like other nations around us."
\v 6 But Samuel was really unhappy with their request, then he prayed asking direction from the LORD.
\v 7 The LORD said to Samuel, "Do whatever they request. I am the one they reject as their king, its not you that they reject!\f + \fr 8:7 \fk I am the one they reject \ft The Israelites request didn't just make Samuel sad, but also God Himself. However the LORD had already permitted in Deut. 17:14-20 for the Israelites to appoint a king to rule over them.\f*
\v 8 Since I led them out of Egypt until now, they left Me and worshiped various [gods//other worships]. What they have done to you, they have done just the same to Me also.
\v 9 Now do whatever they request. But warn them earnestly and tell them how a king will rule over them."
\v 10 So Samuel conveyed to them what was said by the LORD, to the people who requested a king of him.
\v 11 He said, "This is what a king will do who will rule over you all: He will oblige your sons to become soldiers and employ them as chariot drivers and horsemen. They will run before his chariot.
\v 12 The king will appoint a ruler over one thousand people and a ruler over fifty people. In that way also people to plow his land, harvest it, and make weapons of war and chariot tools.
\v 13 The king will take your daughters and make them as perfume makers, cooks and bakers.
\v 14 Continuing on the king will take your fields, your vineyards, and best olive gardens then give them to his own servants.
\v 15 He also will take ten percent of the wheat produced and your grapes and give them to the palace employees and his other helpers.
\v 16 The king will also take your servants, both male and female, also your best cows and your donkeys for his personal interests.
\v 17 He will take ten percent from your flocks of livestock, and you all yourselves will [be enslaved by the king//become his slaves].
\v 18 But the day will come when you all cry out asking help of the LORD because of the king you all chose, the LORD won't answer you all."
\v 19 But that nation rejected Samuel's warning, in fact they said, "No! We want a king to rule over us!
\v 20 In that way we will be like other nations. Our king will rule over us and lead us in war."
\v 21 Samuel heard everything that was said by that nation and conveyed it to the LORD.
\v 22 The LORD said to Samuel, "Do according to their words and inaugerate a king that will rule over them." Then Samuel said to the Israelites, "Return all of you to each of your cities."
