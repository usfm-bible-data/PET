\s David flees from Saul
\p
\v 1 One day, Saul ordered Jonathan and his servants to kill David. But because Jonathan loved David so much,
\v 2-3 he told David, “Be careful because my father is looking for an opportunity to kill you. Tomorrow morning you will hide in the field there. I will take him with me to the field. Then I will talk to him about you. When he returns to town, I'll let you know the results of the discussion.” So David hid in that place.
\p
\v 4 That morning Jonathan reminded his father about the good things that David had done in serving Saul well. Jonathan said, "Don't sin by punishing David, because he didn't do anything wrong to you. He always serves you very well.
\v 5 He risked his life against Goliath, and as a result the LORD gave Israel great victory. You were overjoyed to see these things happen! Don't sin by killing that innocent person! There is no reason to do that!"
\p
\v 6 Saul took Jonathan's advice and swore, "I promise before the LORD who lives that David will not be killed."
\p
\v 7 Then Jonathan summoned David and told him the whole conversation. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul and David returned to serve Saul as before.
\p
\v 8 When there was another battle between the Philistines and Israel, David's army hit the Philistine army so hard that they fled.
\p
\v 9 But one day after that, a tormenting spirit came again from the LORD and took control of Saul. He was sitting in his house holding his spear, and David was playing the lute.
\v 10 Suddenly Saul hurled his spear at David to stick him to the wall. But David dodged it, and the spear stuck in the wall. That night David fled.
\s1 Michal saves David
\p
\v 11 Then Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch over him, with plans to kill him the next morning. But Michal, David's wife told him, "If you don't run away tonight, tomorrow you will definitely be killed!"
\v 12 So Michal helped David down from the window, and he escaped and saved himself.
\v 13 After that, Michal took a statue of a god\f + \fr 19:13 \fk statue of a god \ft It is difficult to interpret why there was a statue of a god in David's house. We know for sure that David himself did not worship a god, but there is some evidence that some women in Israel still kept statues of gods with the hope of bringing good luck.\f* and put it on top of the bed. Then, so that it was similar to David's hair, she put a cloth made of goat hair on the head of the statue, and covered it with a blanket.
\p
\v 14 The next morning when Saul's messengers came to arrest David, Michal said, "David is sick."
\p
\v 15 When Saul heard the report, he said to the messengers, "Bring him to me along with his bed, so that I can kill him."
\v 16 Then the messengers entered David's house, but they only found a statue on his bed with a cloth made of goat hair on its head.
\p
\v 17 Saul said to Michal, “Why are you tricking me in this way? You have already let my enemy go, so he can escape.”
\p Michal answered Saul, "David said to me, 'Let me escape or you will die!'"
\p
\v 18 After David had fled, he went to meet Samuel in the city of Ramah. There he told Samuel all the things that Saul had done to him. Then Samuel and David went together to Naioth.\f + \fr 19:18 \fk Naioth \ft It turns out that from the following verse, Naioth is close to Ramah. The name Naioth means 'dwellings'. Some think that Naioth was the home of a group of prophets. \f*
\v 19 Then Saul received news that David was in Naioth, near the city of Ramah.
\v 20 Then Saul secretly dispatched a squad of soldiers\f + \fr 19:20 \fk a squad of soldiers \ft The Hebrew text in verses 20-21 only mentions 'messengers', but the people sent to catch David must have had weapons. The number of messengers is also unknown, but it is thought that it could have been like a squad. \f* to capture David. But when they came to Naioth, they saw a group of prophets who were prophesying and praising God. Then the Spirit of God also descended on the soldiers and they also prophesied and praised God.
\v 21 Saul received a report about this, so he sent another army, but they also prophesied. Then a third time Saul sent a squad of soldiers, and they too, prophesied.
\v 22 Finally, Saul himself brought a squad of soldiers to the city of Ramah. When he arrived near the big well at Secu village, he asked, “Where is Samuel and David?"
\p The man there answered, "They are in Naioth, near Ramah."
\v 23 As Saul approached Naioth, the Spirit of God descended on him and he prophesied the rest of his journey there.
\v 24 When he arrived, he took off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel. He laid down naked all that day and night. Therefore, other people who heard about the incident asked each other, “Wow! How did Saul become a prophet?!"
