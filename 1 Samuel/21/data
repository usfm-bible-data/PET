\s David at the city of Nob
\p
\v 1 Then David went to the city of Nob to seek guidance from the LORD through Ahimelech the priest. When David met him, Ahimelech trembled with fear and asked, "Why are you alone with no one with you?"
\p
\v 2 David answered him, "The king gave orders for me to do something, but he said, 'Keep secret from everyone the reason I sent you and also the orders that I have given you.' I told my soldiers to wait somewhere.
\v 3 Now, do you Sir have anything to eat? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is available."
\p
\v 4-6 Ahimelech answered, “I have no ordinary bread. There is only the showbread that has been taken up today from the table in the tabernacle of the LORD. You can eat it on the condition that none of you have recently had sex with a woman."
\p David said to the priest, “Don't worry, I never allow myself or my soldiers to defile ourselves by having relations with women, even in carrying out ordinary duties. Especially for this special task, we maintain our own holiness." So the priest gave the leftover show bread to David, because there was no more bread except that which was served to the LORD in the Holy Room in his tabernacle.
\p
\v 7 It so happened that on that day a servant of Saul had come to the tabernacle of the LORD to carry out an obligation before the LORD. This man was named Doeg, an Edomite, who served as overseer of Saul's shepherds. He watched from afar when David met Ahimelech.
\p
\v 8 While still with Ahimelech, David asked, “Do you  Sir have a sword or a spear here? Since the king's orders have to be carried out quickly, I didn't have time to take a sword or another weapon."
\p
\v 9 The priest replied, “There is only one sword here, which is the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it. There's nothing else here."
\p David said, “There is no other sword as good as that! Come, give it to me!"
\s David goes to the city of Gath
\p
\v 10 So from that day on David fled from Saul. He went to King Achish at the city of Gath.\f + \fr 21:10 \fk Gath \ft was the hometown of Goliath, the Philistine giant whom David killed. \f*
\v 11 Achish's servants suspected David and said to Achish, “My king, this man is named David! He was the hero of Israel whom they had praised by dancing and singing,
\q1 'Saul killed thousands of enemies,
\q2 and David killed tens of thousands!'"
\p
\v 12 David thought about what they said and became very afraid of Achish.
\v 13 So before them, David changed his behavior by pretending to be mad. He scratched the gate and let his saliva drip down his beard.
\p
\v 14 Then Achish said to his servants, "Look, this man is crazy! Why are you bringing him to me?!
\v 15 There are already enough crazy people in this city! You don't need to add one more! And don't let someone like this enter my house!"
