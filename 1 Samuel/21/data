\s David in the city of Nob
\p
\v 1 Then David went to the city of Nob to seek guidance from the LORD through Imam Ahimelek. When David met him, Ahimelek trembled with fear and asked, "Why are you alone with no one with you?"
\p
\v 2 David answered to him, "The king gave orders for me to do something, but he said, 'Keep a secret from anyone the reason I sent you and also the orders that I have given you.' I had told my soldiers to wait somewhere.
\v 3 Now, do you have anything to eat? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is available. "
\p
\v 4-6 Ahimelek answered, “I have no ordinary bread. There is only the present day bread that has been taken up from the table in the tabernacle of the LORD. You can eat it on the condition that none of you have just had sex with a woman. "
\p David said to the priest, “Don't worry, I will never allow myself or my soldiers to defile ourselves by having sex with women, even in carrying out ordinary duties. Especially for this special task, we maintain our own holiness. " So the priest gave the former of the showbread to David, because there was no more bread except that which was served to the LORD in the Holy Room in his tabernacle.
\p 7 It so happened that on that day a servant of Saul had come to the tabernacle of the Lord to carry out an obligation before the Lord. This man was named Doeg, an Edomite, who served as overseer of Saul's shepherds. He watched from afar when David met Ahimelek.
\p
\v 8 While still with Ahimelek, David asked, “Do you have a sword or a spear here? Because the king's orders had to be carried out quickly, I didn't have time to take a sword or other weapon. "
\p 9 The priest replied, “There is only one sword here, which is the sword of Goliath the Philistine, which you killed in the Valley of Elah. It was wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it. There's nothing else here. "
\p Said David, “There is no other sword as good as that! Come, give it to me! "
\s David went to the city of Gath
\p
\v 10 So from that day on David fled from Saul. He went to King Akis in the city of Gath. \f + \fr 21:10 \fk Gath \ft was the hometown of Goliath, the Philistine giant whom David killed. \f*
\v 11 Akis's employees suspected David and said to Akis, “My king, this man is named David! He was the hero of Israel whom they had praised by dancing and singing,
\q1 'Saul killed thousands of enemies,
\q2 and David killed tens of thousands! ""
\p
\v 12 David thought about what they said and became very afraid of Akis.
\v 13 So before them, David changed his behavior by pretending to be mad. He scratched the gate and let his saliva drip down his beard.
\p
\v 14 Then Akis said to his staff, "Look, this man is crazy! Why are you bringing it to me ?!
\v 15 There are already enough crazy people in this city! You don't need to add one more! And don't let someone like this enter my house! "
