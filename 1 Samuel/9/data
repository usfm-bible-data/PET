\s1 Samuel meets with Saul
\p
\v 1 Among the people of the tribe of Benjamin, there was a reputable man, named Kish, the son of Abiel. Abiel was the son of Zeror, Zeror was the son of Becorath, and Becorath was the son of Aphiah from the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 2 Kish had a son named Saul. Saul was young that was very handsome and had a body taller than the average people of Israel,  who in general only came to Saul's shoulders. There wasn't nayone inamong of the people of Israel that exceed his higher.
\p
\v 3 One day some donkeys owned by Kish disappear. Kish said to Saul, "My son, Take a slave man with you and go to find our donkeys."
\v 4 Then Saul along with his slave explores the regions of the mountains of Ephraim, untill the region of Shalishah. Then thay enter in the area of Shaalim, and searched in all the region of Benjamin. But they didn't find those donkeys.
\p
\v 5 When they arrived in Zuph, Saul said to his slave, "come one, lets go home. Lest my father worry more about us than those donkeys!"
\p
\v 6 The servant answered, "Oh! I suddenly remembered!In this city there is a servant of God. He is very respected  as prophet because everything he says truly happens. Let's go meet him, perhaps he can give directions to us where those donkeys are."
\p
\v 7 Then Saul said to him, "Well, we may go to meet him! But we don't have anything to give as a gift, even our food already finished. What can we give him?"
\p
\v 8 That slave answered, "I have a piece of silver of 3 grams.\f + \fr 9:8 \fk a piece â€¦ \ft Literally, 'a quarter shekel'. That is the same as about 3 grams of silver.\f* We can give it to him so that he tells us where we have to go."
\v 9 (At that time there, usually a prophet was called as the seer, if a person wanted to know the will of God, thye would say, "Come, let's go to the seer.")
\p
\v 10 Saul said to his servant, "well! Come on, let us go." So they went to the city where the servant of God lived.
\v 11 When through the way climbing the hill that goes to the city, they met with several young girls who were going out to the well to draw water. Saul and his slave asked to that young girls, "Is the seer here?"
\p
\v 12 The young women answered, "Yes, he is here. He just came to lead the ceremony of offering sacrifice to the LORD for the people, in the altar that is in the top of this hill.
\v 13 You can meet him when you all enter into the city, before he climbs the hill to eat. The invitees won't begin the ceremony before he arrives, because the he must bless the burnt sacrifice first. After that, the invitees will eat. It better you climb quickly, because this is the time you can meet him!"
\p
\v 14 When Saul and that slave were entering the gate of that city, they met with Samuel who was walking climbing toward the hill.
\p
\v 15 The day before Saul came, the LORD had told Samuel,
\v 16 "Tomorrow approximately at time that same like this time, I will send to you a young man from the land of Benjamin. You have to anoint him as king over My people Israel. He will save My people from the power of the Philistines. Because I have compassion on My people, and their cries have already heard by Me!"
\p
\v 17 When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is him that I told you! He will rule over My people."
\p
\v 18 that same moment Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate and asked to him, "Sir, can you tell me where is the house of the seer?"
\p
\v 19 Samuel answered Saul, "I am that seer! Go before me to the altar place in the top of the hill Today we will eat with together. Tomorrow morning I will answer your questions, then you you may go home.
\v 20 Don't worry about your donkeys that disappeared three days ago, because they have been found. But you and your family are the core of the hope of all the nation of Israel."
\p
\v 21 But Saul answered, "I am just a normal person from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe among all the tribes of Israel. And my family is considered the most low of all families that tribe. Why does Sir speak like that to me?"
\p
\v 22 Then Samuel brought Saul and his slave to a large meeting room that was there next to the altar and gave them the most important place to sit in front of all of the invitees. The number of invitees were about thirty people.
\v 23 Samuel said to the chef, "Give to him the portion of meat that I asked you to set aside to the honored guest."
\v 24 So the chef brought it and placed the chosen meat from the part of thigh in front of Saul. Samuel said to Saul, "This portion was prepared especially for you in this eating feast this! Eat with the  guests that I invited  to attend this feast." So Saul ate with Samuel on that day.
\p
\v 25 After that they returned to Samuel's house in the city, Samuel and Saul chatted on the roof of his house.\f + \fr 9:25 \fk roof of his house \ft At that time, the shape of the roofs of houses were flat and could be used to chat  without other people hear and as  a place to the guests sleep.\f*
\v 26 early in the morning at dawn, Samuel call Saul who was sleeping in the part of the roof of the house, "Get up! Is time to leave. I will bring you  to the border of the city." So Saul got up, and they leave.
\v 27 While they were walking to the border of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Order your slave to go before ust." Then Saul ordered his servant like that. Then Samuel said to Saul, "Wait a moment, because I want to tell a message from God to you."
