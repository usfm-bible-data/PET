\s David lets Saul live once again
\p
\v 1 The Ziphites came to Saul in Gibeah and told him, "David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah which is overlooking the wilderness."
\p
\v 2 Then Saul hurriedly set out for the wilderness of Ziph. He brought three thousand troops selected from the whole Israelite army to search for David there.
\v 3 Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hakilah and faced the wilderness, but David stayed in the wilderness. When David heard that Saul had come into the wilderness to hunt him,
\v 4 he sent some spies to verify that Saul had indeed arrived.
\p
\v 5 So David and some of his followers went to the place where Saul was staying the night. David saw that Saul was sleeping beside Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army. Saul and Abner slept in the middle, while the whole army slept around them.
\v 6 Then David asked Ahimelech and Abishai, "Which of you will come with me to the place where Saul is sleeping?" (Ahimelech was a Hittite, and Abishai was the son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab.)
\p Abishai answered, "I will."
\v 7 So that night David and Abishai passed among the sleeping soldiers until they found the place where Saul was fast asleep, with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers lay around him.
\p
\v 8 And Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered the enemy of my Lord into your hands. Let your servant act! With just one stab I will stick his own spear into his stomach until it reaches the ground!"
\p
\v 9 But David answered, “Don't kill him! For anyone who slays the LORD's anointed king will certainly be punished.”
\v 10 Again said David, "I swear to the LORD who lives, that the LORD Himself will kill Saul, whether he dies because the day arrives, or because he is killed in battle.
\v 11 But let the LORD always prevent me from slaying the king whom he has chosen! We'll just take the spear and the water jug, then we'll go!”
\p
\v 12 So David took the spear and the jug that were near Saul's head, and they went away. No one knew what they were doing, because the LORD had made Saul and all his troops fast asleep.
\p
\v 13 Then David and Abishai crossed the valley and stood on the top of the hill opposite Saul's army, so that there was quite a distance between them.
\v 14 Then David shouted to the troops of Saul and Abner son of Ner, “Abner! Can you hear my voice?"
\p Abner replied, "Who are you, that you dare to shout and wake the king from his sleep?"
\p
\v 15-16 David said to Abner, “Aren't you the strongest of all the army of Israel?! So why didn't you protect your lord the king, whom the LORD has chosen? Earlier an enemy had come who wanted to kill your lord the king, but you failed to guard him, Abner! Therefore, before the LORD who lives, I say that you and all your troops deserve the death penalty! Now look! Where's the king's spear and water jug that was near his head!”
\p
\v 17 Saul recognized David's voice, so Saul said, "Isn't that your voice, David my son?"
\p David replied, "Yes, it is I, my Lord the King."
\v 18 Then David asked, "Why is it that my Lord the King is chasing your servant?! What is your servant's fault? What evil have I committed?
\v 19 Let my Lord the King listen to the words of your servant. If it is the LORD who moves my Lord the King to fight against me, let Him accept a sin offering that I can offer. But if man moves my Lord the King to fight against me, let the LORD curse my enemies! Because of their actions, I was driven out of the land I inherited as a citizen of the LORD's people, and it was as if my enemies were telling me, 'Go to another land and worship their gods!'
\v 20 But I prayed, 'Let the LORD prevent my blood from being spilled in another land, far from your sight.' My Lord, is there any use for you to bring thousands of Israelite troops out just to hunt a partridge in a hilly area?! Even I am like a flea! What's the point of looking for me?!”
\p
\v 21 Saul answered, "I have sinned! Come back, my son David. I will no longer do evil to you, because tonight you have counted my life as precious. I was being stupid. I was completely wrong!”
\p
\v 22 David answered, “My Lord the King's spear is here! Send someone here to get it.
\v 23 The LORD will reward everyone according to his sincerity and faithfulness. Even though today the LORD has given the life of my Lord the King into my hands, I refuse to hurt the king whom He has chosen.
\v 24 So, as the life of my Lord the King is precious in my eyes tonight, may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all danger."
\p
\v 25 Then Saul answered David, "May the LORD bless you, my son David! You will certainly do great things and succeed in all your endeavors!" So David returned to his hometown, and Saul returned to his palace.
