\s1 Jonathan helps David
\p
\v 1 David fled from Naioth and went to Jonathan, and asked, "What was my fault or sin against your father that he wanted to kill me?"
\p
\v 2 Jonathan answered, “That's not true! I'm sure he didn't have such a terrible plan, because he always told me all his plans, both big and small matters. There was no way he could hide that from me. That can't be true! "
\p
\v 3 David answered, “Your father knows about our friendship. That's why he won't tell you, so as not to hurt your heart. I declare before the Lord who lives and before you that I am very close to death. ”
\p
\v 4 Then Jonathan said to David, "Well, then, tell me how I can help you!"
\p
\v 5 David said to him, “You know that tomorrow is the new moon, and I usually eat with the king on that day. But this time let me hide in the fields until evening on the third day.
\v 6 When your father asks about me, say, 'David asked me to go back to Bethlehem, because there is an annual sacrifice for his whole family.'
\v 7 If he says, 'OK,' then I'm not in any danger. However, if it makes him very angry, then you will find out that he has evil intentions towards me.
\v 8 Show your love and loyalty to your servant, because we have made a covenant of friendship before the Lord. If I'm guilty, you better kill me! But don't leave me to your father. "
\p
\v 9 Jonathan answered, “Never! If I found out that my father had a plan to kill you, I would have told you! "
\p
\v 10 Then David asked, "How do we organize a plan so that I can know when your father is angry with me?"
\p
\v 11 Jonathan answered, "Let us go out into the field." So they went out together into the field. 12 Then Jonathan said to David, “I promise before the Lord God of Israel, that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, around this time, I will investigate my father's feelings for you. When things are okay, I will send someone to share the news with you.
\v 13 But if my father is very angry and wants to kill you, I promise to tell you and send you away. Let the LORD punish me, even take my life, if I don't keep this promise! And let the LORD be with you, as he was with my father before.
\v 14 If I am still alive, remember our friendship covenant and show me your love and loyalty. But if I'm dead,
\v 15 I beg you to continue to show your love and loyalty to my descendants forever, even when the Lord has cut off all your enemies from the face of the earth. "
\p
\v 16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "Let the LORD destroy all your enemies."
\v 17 Then Jonathan asked David to repeat their oath of friendship again, because he loved David as himself.
\p
\v 18 Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is a new moon celebration, and you will certainly be questioned because your seat is empty.
\v 19 Then the day after tomorrow you will definitely be sought. Then go to the field where you had been hiding, and sit behind the rock there.
\v 20 I will shoot three arrows at the side of the rock, as if I were aiming for a target.
\v 21 Then I would say to my slave, 'Go and find the arrows.' If I then say, 'Look, the arrow is closer here,' then you are safe and you don't have to hide anymore. If I say this, I promise before the living God that nothing will harm you.
\v 22 But, if I say, 'Behold, the arrows are still further away,' then go away. It means that the LORD is actually sending you away.
\v 23 If that happens, may the LORD bear witness forever that we faithfully remember our covenant. "
\p
\v 24 Then David hid in the field. And at the celebration of the new moon, the king sat in his place.
\v 25 As usual he sits by the wall. Jonathan sat opposite him, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's seat was empty.
\v 26 That day Saul did not say anything, because he thought that perhaps David could not participate in the festival that day because he touched something that made him unclean.
\v 27 When David's seat was still empty the next day, Saul said to Jonathan, "Why didn't the son of Jesse come to eat yesterday or today?"
\p
\v 28 Jonathan answered, “He begged me earnestly to let him return to Bethlehem.
\v 29 He said, 'Let me go, because there was a sacrifice for our family there. My brother has given the message that I must attend. Thus, if I am pleased in your eyes, let me go to see my brethren. "That is why David did not come to the king's banquet."
\p 30 Then Saul was very angry with Jonathan and said, “You bastard rebellious son! Don't I know that you have sided with David and that you have embarrassed yourself and your mother?
\v 31 As long as the son of Jesse is alive, you will not be able to be king. Now go and bring him here, so that I can kill him! "
\p
\v 32 Jonathan answered, "Why should he be killed?! What has he done? " 33 Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan to kill him. So Jonathan was well aware that his father really intended to kill David.
\p
\v 34 Then Jonathan became angry, and he left the table. He did not eat anything on the second day of the new moon, because his heart was troubled and troubled because his father had insulted him and wanted to kill David.
\p
\v 35 The next morning, Jonathan went out into the field with his slave, a young boy, according to his promise to David.
\v 36 Jonathan said to his slave, "Run and look for the arrows that I have shot." While his slave was running, Jonathan fired an arrow which went further past the slave. 37 As the slave approached the place where the arrows had fallen, Jonathan exclaimed, "Isn't the arrow farther away?"
\v 38 Then Jonathan shouted again, “Come on, hurry! Don't just stand there! " Then the slave took the arrows and ran back to hand them over to his master.
\v 39 But the slave did not understand anything. Only Jonathan and David knew what this sign meant. 40 Then Jonathan gave the slave his bow and arrows and said, "Go and bring it back to the city."
\p 41 When the slave had departed, David emerged from his hiding place and bowed down three times before Jonathan. And they both hugged each other and cried together, but David cried even louder.
\p 42 Then Jonathan said to David, "Go away with a feeling of calm, for we have sworn before the Lord, saying, 'May the LORD keep our relationship, and our descendants, forever.'" After that, David left, and Jonathan returns to town.
