\c 14
\p
\v 1 One day, Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Let us go across to the Philistine outpost there!" But Jonathan did not tell his father what he would do.
\p
\v 2 At that time, Saul was still stayed in Gibea. He was sitting under a pomegranate tree in Migron, which was a place at the end of the Gibea region. Around six hundred people were there with him.
\v 3 Among these people were Ahijah, son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod. Ichabod was the son of Phinehas, and grandson of Eli, the LORD's priest at Shiloh. By this time Ahijah had succeeded Eli as the priest wearing the ephod.
\p They did not know either that Jonathan had left.
\v 4-5 Jonathan tried to reach the Philistine outpost. In order to reach it, he had to climb a narrow crossing between two steep cliffs. The cliff on the north side close to Michmash was called Bozez, while the cliff on the south side near Geba was called Seneh.
\v 6 Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Let us approach these idolaters!\f + \fr 14:6 \fk idolaters \ft Literally the Hebrew text writes,"uncircumcised people". According to Gen. 17:9-14, circumcision is a sign that every descendant of Abraham's men will obey all provisions in the LORD's covenant with Abraham. In a context like this, the word 'uncircumcised' is indeed a mockery, but actually refers to something more important than circumcision, namely that Goliath and the Philistines do not belong to Abraham's descendants, and do not know God.\f* Perhaps the Lord will help us! There is nothing that can prevent the Lord from saving, whether the number of our troops are many or few.
\p
\v 7 Then his armor bearer said, "Do as you wish, sir. I'm ready to support you!"
\p
\v 8 Jonathan said, "Alright! Let's approach the Philistine army to show ourselves to them.
\v 9 If they say to us, 'Wait there, until we come to you,' then we will remain in that place and will not rise again to come to them.
\v 10 But if they say, 'Come here and fight us,' then we will climb to attack them. That means the LORD has delivered them into our hands. That is the sign for us."
\p
\v 11 Then Jonathan and his armor bearer showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. Some of them mocked, "Look! There are some cowards Israelites who came out of their hiding places!"
\v 12 Then they shouted at Jonathan and his armor bearer, "You come up here, so we can teach you a lesson!"
\p Then Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come up behind me, because the LORD has handed them over to the Israelites!"
\p
\v 13-14 To climb the cliff they both had to crawl with their hands and feet, Jonathan in front and his armor bearer behind him. Jonathan immediately attacked the soldiers at the outpost with his sword, his armor bearer joined behind him and killed the enemies that Jonathan had injured. About twenty people were killed in a place that did not cover a quarter hectare. The attack initiated the defeat of the Philistines.
\p
\v 15 At that time panic struck all the Philistine troops, both those in the camp, and those who had taken position on the battlefield, at the outposts, and groups that were looting. Then God made the earth tremble, so that their fear increased.
\s Israel defeats the Philistines
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile, those who were on guard around Saul in Gibeah heard a commotion from the direction of the Philistine army camp. They also saw that many Philistine soldiers had fled in all directions.
\v 17 Then Saul said to the troops that were with him, "Gather a line and check who is not with us." And when they inspected the line,was known that Jonathan and his armor bearer were not with them.
\p
\v 18 After realizing that, Saul wanted to ask for guidance from God. Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ephod here!"\x + \xo 14:18 \xt Ex. 28:30\x* At that time Ahijah used the ephod in his service as a priest for the people of Israel.\f + \fr 14:18 \fk textual differences \ft Masoretic text writes, "'Bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD.' At that time the ark was there with the Israelites." TSI follows the Septuagint in this verse.\f*
\v 19 As Saul began to talk to the priest, the situation of the Philistine army encampment became even more chaotic. That influenced Saul to say to the priest, "There is no time to ask for guidance from God!"
\p
\v 20 Saul and all his troops ran to the battlefield. There they saw great chaos because fellow Philistine soldiers killed each other with their own a sword.
\v 21 The Israelites who had previously sided with the Philistines and stayed at their camp, rejoined the Israelite army to help Saul and Jonathan.
\v 22 Likewise the Israelites who had previously hidden in the hills of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines had fled, they joined again in chasing the Philistine soldiers who were fleeing from the battlefield.
\v 23 Thus the LORD saved the Israelites that day, and the battle spread to the area of Beth Aven.
\s Jonathan breaks Saul's oath
\p
\v 24 The day-long battle left the Israelite troops exhausted and hungry, because on that morning Saul had bound them with an oath, "May the LORD curse any of us who eat anything before sunset, and before I take revenge on my enemies!" So, none of the soldiers ate anything during the day.
\v 25 When they walked into the forest, they saw honey dripping on the ground.
\v 26 But no one took and ate the honey because they were afraid of breaking the oath that Saul had made.
\p
\v 27 But Jonathan did not hear when his father bound the entire troops in his oath. So, he stretched out his staff and dipped the tip of the staff into the honeycomb and tasted the honey. After that, he felt a new strength.\f + \fr 14:27 \fk felt ... \ft Literally, ‘his eyes became bright’. \f*
\v 28 Then a member of the troop told him, "Sir, your father have bound the troops with an oath, 'Let the LORD curse anyone who eats any food today!' That is why we are very tired."
\p
\v 29 So Jonathan answered, "Wow, in this way my father harmed us! Look, I'm getting stronger after just tasting this honey.
\v 30 If all the troops were allowed to eat the food they had taken from the enemy they met today, surely the defeat of the Philistines would have been even greater.”
\p
\v 31 On that day the Israelite troops defeated the Philistines from the city of Michmash westward to the city of Aijalon, so that the whole Israelite army became very tired and hungry."
\v 32 For this reason, in the evenings they took the plunder, such as sheep, cows and calves. They slaughtered the animals on the ground and immediately ate meat that still contained blood.
\v 33 Then it was reported to Saul, "Look, the members of the our army had sinned against the LORD by eating meat that still have blood in it."\x + \xo 14:33 \xt Gen. 9:4; Lev. 7:26-27; Lev. 17:10-14; Lev. 19:26; Deut. 12:23-25 \x*
\p Saul said, "Do not disobey the commands of the Lord! Roll a large rock here. Use it as a place to slaughter animals and drain their blood."
\v 34 Then Saul said again, "Distribute this command to the whole army, 'Bring the loot to this stone to slaughter it and drain its blood. Do not sin against the LORD by eating flesh that still has blood.'"
\p So, that night everyone took his bull and slaughtered it there.
\v 35 Then Saul built an altar for the LORD from stones. That was the first altar he had built for the LORD.
\p
\v 36 And Saul said, "Let's chase the Philistines tonight and plunder them until dawn. We will not let any of them live!"
\p Then all the troops said, "Do what is best according to you, sir."
\p But the priest Ahijah said, "Let us first ask for God's guidance."
\p
\v 37 So Ahijah used the Urim and Thummim\f + \fr 14:37 \fk Urim ... Thummim \ft Urim and Thummim are the two lottery items used by priests to know the will of the LORD. The form and method of drawing are not known with certainty. See Ex. 28:30; Num. 27:21. \f* for Saul to ask God, "Should I give orders to pursue the Philistine armies now? Will you deliver them into our hands?" But God did not answer Saul at that time.
\p
\v 38 Then Saul said, "All of you, leaders of the troops, come here! Let's find out who has sinned today.
\v 39 In the presence of the living LORD, who always saves Israel, I swear that those who committed sins will be put to death, even if it turns out to be my own son!" But none of the soldiers answered him.
\p
\v 40 Then Saul said to all the army of Israel, "You stand there, while Jonathan and I stand here." The army answered Saul, "Do what is best according to you, Sir."
\p
\v 41 Then Saul said, "LORD God of Israel, please show me why you did not answer my question today: If I or Jonathan have sinned, then show the Urim. But if this sin was committed by the Israelite army, show the Thummim."\f + \fr 14:41 \fk Saul's quote \ft TSI translates according to the Septuagint in this quote.\f* It turned out that the lottery pointed to Jonathan and Saul, while the soldiers were free from accusation.
\p
\v 42 Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan!" And the draw showed Jonathan guilty.
\p
\v 43 So Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done!"
\p Jonathan said, "I dipped the tip of my staff in honey to taste a little of it. Is that why I deserve to be sentenced to death?!"
\p
\v 44 Saul said, "Yes! Let God punish me, even take my life, if you are not condemned to die because of that sin!"
\p
\v 45 But the army said to Saul, "No! Jonathan must not be punished, because he is the one who brought a great victory for Israel today. No! Do not punish him! We promise before the living LORD that not a single hair will fall from his head, because God has used him today to do a very great thing." So the members of the army rescued Jonathan from the death sentence.
\p
\v 46 So Saul stopped pursuing the Philistine troops, so that the Philistines were allowed to return to their respective regions.
\p
\v 47-48 After Saul's position as king over Israel became stronger, he fought against all their enemies in all directions, including the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, the kings\f + \fr 14:47 \fk kings \ft TSI translates according to the Masoretic Text, but in the Text of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Septuagint is the word 'king'.\f* of Zobah, and the Philistines. Saul even released Israel from the oppression of the Amalekites. Wherever Saul went to war, he always won. By doing mighty deeds, he delivered the Israelites from the power of their enemies.
\s Members of Saul's family
\p
\v 49 Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua. While his daughters were Merab and Michal.
\v 50 Saul's wife was named Ahinoam, Ahimaaz's daughter. The commander of the army was Abner, Ner's son, Saul's uncle.
\v 51 Kish is the father of Saul, and Ner is the father of Abner. Kish and Ner are Abiel's sons.
\p
\v 52 There were intense battles between the Israelites and the Philistines during Saul's life. Therefore, if Saul saw a strong and brave young man, then he immediately made that person a member of his army.
