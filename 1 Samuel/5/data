\s1 Disaster for the Philistines because they took God's Chest of Promise
\p
\v 1 The Philistines had taken God's Chest of Promise and brought it from the City of Ebenezer to Ashdod.
\v 2 They brought God's Chest of Promise into the worship room of Dagon, the god they worshiped, and placed God's Chest of Promise next to the statue of Dagon.
\v 3 However the next morning, when the residents of the City of Ashdod entered into the worship room, they found the statue of the god Dagon had fallen down with its face facing down in front of God's Chest of Promise. Then they lifted the statue of Dagon and returned it to the former place.
\v 4 And the next day [again], when they got up, the statue of Dagon had returned to lying on the ground in front of God's Chest of Promise. However, this time, the head and two hands of the statue of Dagon had come off from its body and were on the door threshold. Only its body was before God's Chest of Promise.
\v 5 That's why, until this day, whoever enters the room of worship of Dagon in Ashdod is forbidden to step on the door threshold.

\v 6 The LORD [gave harsh punishment/judged] the residents of the City of Ashdod and the surrounding area. He made them suffer greatly, because they were struck by a disease that caused tumors\f + \fr 5:6\fk tumors \ft In the LXX text and Vulgate is added "And rats overran their land, and death along with destruction struck the whole city." It is thought that with the tumors in certain [on] parts of [their] bodies and many rats, then the disease that the residents of Ashdod suffered was the bubonic plague.\f* on certain parts [on] their bodies.
\v 7 When all of the residents of Ashdod saw what happened, they said, "The God of Israel's Chest of Promise can not remain with us! The God of Israel is [giving/sending] judgment that is heavy on usâ€” and our god!"
\v 8 Then the residents of Ashdod sent a message that all of the leaders of the Philistines gather. When they had gathered, the residents of Ashdod asked them, "What must we do with the God of Israel's Chest of Promise?"
\p After discussing the situation, they decided, "Let's move the God of Israel's Chest of Promise to Gath." Then they moved the God of Israel's Chest of Promise to Gath.
\v 9 But after God's Chest of Promise moved to Gath, the LORD also judged the City of Gath so that a great panic happened there. He judged the residents of that city also with the same disease.

\v 10 Then it was decided again to send God's Chest of Promise to Ekron. But when God's Chest of Promise arrived in Ekron, all of [it's residents//the City of Ekron] were afraid and protested, "They've brought the God of Israel's Chest of Promise here to kill us!"
\v 11 So the leaders of the Philistines gathered again and said, "Bring the God of the Israelites' Chest of Promise out of here! Return it to its former place so that God's Chest of Promise doesn't kill us and our people!" They said that because the shadow of death haunted the whole city. God judged them with great power.
\v 12 There were those who had already died. And those who still lived Were also attacked by the plague. Cries of help of the residents of that city could be heard from far because of the very loud noise.
