\c 15 God appoints the Amalekites to be destroyed
\p
\v 1 One day Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, Israel. Therefore, listen to the LORD's message.
\v 2 The LORD Almighty says, ‘I will repay the deeds of the Amalekites because they did not allow my people, Israel, to pass through their territory when Israel left Egypt.\x + \xo 15:2 \xt Ex. 17:1-16 \x*
\v 3 Therefore go and attack the Amalekites! I have appointed them all to be destroyed,\f + \fr 15:3 appointed\fk ...to be destroyed \ft The term "to appoint to be destroyed" is God's decision to execute a person or many people in total. All possessions of the person being punished must also be destroyed. See Ex. 22:20; Lev. 27:28-29; and Deut. 7:25-26. The LORD's command concerning the Amalekites was in accordance with Exod. 17:14-16.\f* so destroy everything, both them and everything they have, without exceptions. Kill all men, women, children and babies. Also kill the cows, sheep, camels and donkeys."
\p
\v 4 So Saul gathered an army in the city of Telaim. Their number were 200,000 soldiers on foot from Israel, and 10,000 soldiers from the tribe of Judah.
\v 5 After this Saul and his army entered the Amalekite territory and hid in a valley near one of their major cities, and set an ambush.
\v 6 Saul sent this message to the Kenites who lived close to the Amalekites, "Go and stay away from the Amalekites. If not, you will also be destroyed." Saul did not want to finish off the Kenites because they were kind to the people of Israel when they left Egypt. Hearing Saul's message, the Kenites left Amalek.
\p
\v 7 After this, Saul and his army fought and defeated the Amalekites from the city of Havilah to the city of Shur, east of Egypt.
\v 8 Saul and his army killed all the Amalekites, but Agag, the king of the Amalekites, was captured alive.
\v 9 Besides Agag, they also did not kill the healthy flocks of sheep and livestock, and did not destroy all the goods and animals they thought were valuable. They just killed everything that was not valuable.
\s The LORD rejects Saul as king
\p
\v 10 And the LORD said unto Samuel,
\v 11 "I am very sad that I have made Saul king, because he has forsaken me and not done all my commandments." This made Samuel very sad, and he prayed to the LORD while crying all night.
\p
\v 12 The next morning, very early in the morning Samuel went to meet Saul. But someone told him, "Saul went to the city of Carmel to erect a memorial to himself, and then Saul went to Gilgal."
\p
\v 13 Samuel finally met Saul at Gilgal. Saul greeted Samuel by saying, "May the LORD bless you! I have done what the LORD commanded."
\p
\v 14 So Samuel answered, "Then why do I hear the sound of sheep and cattle here?"
\p
\v 15 Saul answered, "That is the best sheep and cattle that were saved by the soldiers of the Amalekites to be offered to the LORD our God. But everything else we have destroyed."
\p
\v 16 So Samuel said to him, "Wait! Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night."
\p Saul answered, "Say it."
\p
\v 17 Samuel said, "You used to think that you were insignificant. But now you have become the leader of the tribes of Israel. The LORD has anointed you king over Israel.
\v 18 The LORD sent you with this command, ‘Because of the sins of the Amalekites, go and destroy them completely. Finish them off.'
\v 19 Why did you disobey the LORD's command?! You are even busy taking their property. Your deeds are evil in the eyes of the LORD!"
\p
\v 20 Saul answered Samuel, "But I have obeyed the LORD's command to go to war. I only brought their king here, while I killed all his people.
\v 21 But the soldiers brought the best booty of sheep and cattle here. Instead of destroying it, we want to offer it to the LORD your God in Gilgal."
\p
\v 22 Then Samuel said,
\q1 "Which one makes the LORD happy? - burnt sacrifices and offerings,
\q2 or obedience?
\q1 Indeed, obedience is far better than offerings.
\q1 Listening attentively is far better than offering fat rams.
\p
\v 23 Because rebellion is as great a sin as the sin of sorcery,
\q2 and disobedience like the sin of idolatry.
\q1 Because you have refused the commands of the LORD,
\q2 then He has already rejected you as king."
\s Saul begs for forgiveness
\p
\v 24 Then Saul answered Samuel, "That's right! I have sinned. I have disobeyed the LORD's commands and your words too, because I feared the soldiers and I followed their words.
\v 25 But now I sincerely beg you, forgive my sins! Come back with me so that I can worship the LORD."
\p
\v 26 Then Samuel said, "I will not return with you. You have rejected the LORD's command, so He has rejected you as king over Israel!”
\p
\v 27 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul grasped Samuel's robe so tightly that it was torn.
\v 28 So Samuel said, "Likewise the LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you and has given it to one of your fellow Israelites, who is a better person than you!
\v 29 The Glorious LORD God of Israel does not lie, and does not change His decisions. Because He is not like humans who always change their opinions."
\p
\v 30 But Saul said again, "Yes, sir! I have sinned. But I ask you to honor me before the elders and before the people of Israel. Come back with me so that I can worship the LORD your God."
\v 31 So Samuel returned to the site of worship along with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
\s Samuel kills Agag
\p
\v 32 Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag here, the king of the Amalekites." Agag came trembling because he thought, "How bitter it feels, facing my death!"\f + \fr 15:32 \fk Agag came... \ft The Hebrew text is very difficult in this sentence. The word TSI translates ‘trembling’ can be translated ‘shackled/bound’ or ‘confident smile’. And the quote of Agag's thought can be translated, "Surely the time to face the bitterness of death has passed." \f*
\v 33 But Samuel said to him, "Just as your sword has made the women of other nations lose their children, so your mother will now be a woman who has lost a child!" Then Samuel killed Agag and cut his body in pieces before the LORD at Gilgal.
\p
\v 34 Then Samuel returned to Ramah, and Saul returned to his home in Gibeah.
\v 35 From that time until Samuel died, he did not see Saul again. But Samuel never escaped the sadness he had because God had rejected Saul as king of Israel. And the LORD was very sad because he had made Saul king.
