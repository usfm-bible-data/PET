\c 19
\s When Paul was in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 While Apollos was still in the city of Corinth, in the province of Achaia, Paul visited several regions in the provinces of Galatia and Phrygia. Then he kept traveling through the interior of the province of Asia, and arrived again in Ephesus. There he met some believers.
\v 2 So he asked them, “When you believed in Jesus, did you also receive the Holy Spirit?”
\p They answered, “Not yet— in fact we haven’t even heard of the Holy Spirit.”
\p
\v 3 Then he asked again, “If that’s so, whose teaching about baptism are you following?”
\p They said, “What John taught.”
\p
\v 4 Then Paul said, “John baptized people as a sign that they had repented of their sins, and at that time he also told them that they must believe in the One who would come after him— namely Jesus.”
\p
\v 5 When they heard Paul say that, they asked him to baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 6 And when Paul laid his hands on each of them, God’s Spirit came down on them, and they began to speak in various languages of the Spirit, and prophesied.
\v 7 There were about twelve men in all.
\p
\v 8 For the next three months, while Paul stayed in Ephesus, he often entered the Jewish synagogue. He debated boldly, and convinced them about the news of salvation and God’s kingdom.
\v 9 But some of them hardened their hearts and refused to believe in Jesus, and they insulted the way of salvation through Jesus in public. Because of that, Paul left the synagogue, and he urged the other believers to separate themselves from the people who didn’t believe in Jesus. After that, he taught those believers every day in the meeting hall which was called the Discussion Hall of Tyrannus.\f + \fr 19:9 \fk Discussion Hall of Tyrannus \ft Tyrannus is the name of a person. It isn’t known now if he was the one who owned the hall, or usually taught there. The root word for the name Tyrannus means “authority.”\f*
\v 10 And Paul continued to teach in that place for two more years, so that all the people who lived in the province of Asia— both Jews and non-Jews, heard the news of salvation about the Lord Jesus.
\s Seven sons of Sceva imitate Paul
\p
\v 11 God did many unusual miracles through Paul at that time.
\v 12 If sick people couldn’t come to meet Paul, then people brought handkerchiefs or cloths that Paul had touched and laid them on the sick people, and they were healed. And there were also some who placed them on people who were possessed, and the evil spirits left them.
\p
\v 13 But there were some Jewish shamans who traveled from city to city. They tried to drive out evil spirits by using the name of the Lord Jesus. And several times they tried telling people who were possessed by evil spirits, “In the name of Jesus who Paul teaches, we command you to come out of this person.”
\v 14 Seven sons of a man named Sceva did it. (Sceva was the descendant of a Jewish priest, and he claimed to be the high priest.)
\p
\v 15 But once when they tried doing it again, the evil spirit answered them through the mouth of the possessed person, “I know who Jesus is, and I’ve heard about Paul, but who’re you?!”
\v 16 Then the person who was possessed by the evil spirit jumped up and attacked them. He overcame them and tore off their clothes so that they were wounded, and ran naked from that house.
\p
\v 17 When all the people who lived in Ephesus— both the Jews and non-Jews, heard what happened, they were very afraid, and truly honored the Lord Jesus.
\v 18 Then many people who had believed in Jesus came and confessed in public that they had been involved in sorcery.
\v 19 In fact, many of them gathered their sorcery books and burned them in front of everyone. The total value of those books was about 50,000 silver coins, if counted with money.
\v 20 That way the news of salvation about the Lord Jesus spread more and more, and increased in its effect.
\s Paul plans a trip
\p
\v 21 After all of that happened, Paul planned to go to Jerusalem by passing through Macedonia and Achaia. And he also said, “After I go there, I must visit Rome.”
\v 22 Then Paul sent two of his representatives— namely Timothy and Erastus, to go ahead of him to the province of Macedonia. Meanwhile, he himself stayed a while longer in the province of Asia.
\s The riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 23 At about that time, a great riot took place because people opposed the way of salvation taught by Paul.
\v 24 The problem began with a businessman named Demetrius. His business was making artistic objects from silver. There was a temple for the goddess Artemis in that city, and Demetrius, along with his coworkers, made small temples in the shape of the goddess’ temple. The small temples were sold to worshipers of the goddess, so everyone who was involved in that business made a lot of money.
\v 25 Demetrius gathered all the craftsmen who were involved in that business and said to them, “Brothers, you all know that we make a lot of money because of this business.”
\v 26 But now you see and hear for yourselves that Paul has changed the thinking of many people by saying, ‘The gods and goddesses made by human hands don’t live and don’t have power over anything at all.’ And he has succeeded in changing the thinking of many people— including the residents of Ephesus as well as residents of all the regions in Asia.
\v 27 So isn’t just unfortunate that our business will be considered useless, but the main center for the worship of our goddess will be considered useless later on too, and the greatness of the name of Artemis herself will be trampled on! How unfortunate! For she’s the goddess who’s worshiped by everyone in Asia and in the whole world.”
\p
\v 28 When they heard him speak like that, their hearts were inflamed, and they shouted, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”
\v 29 Then the whole city was in chaos, and two of Paul’s followers from Macedonia, Gaius and Aristarchus, were captured and dragged along when the crowd ran wildly into the stadium.
\v 30 At the time, Paul wanted to enter the stadium to speak to the crowd too, but the brothers and sisters in the faith wouldn’t allow him.
\v 31 Even some high officials of the province of Asia who had become close friends of Paul sent word that he shouldn’t enter the place.
\p
\v 32 The situation in the stadium was very chaotic because some people were shouting about one issue, and others were shouting about something else. So most of the people didn’t know why they were there.
\v 33 Then some Jews pushed a man named Alexander to the front, because they wanted him to explain that the people who caused this problem weren’t Jews. Because Alexander wanted to speak, he signaled with his hand so that they would be quiet.
\v 34 But when the crowd realized that he was a Jew, they shouted for about two hours, “Great is Artemis, the goddess of the Ephesians!”
\p
\v 35 Then the city secretary commanded the crowd to be calm. After that he said, “Hey you people of Ephesus, there’s no need for a commotion! Doesn’t everyone in the world know that we Ephesians are the ones who guard the main temple of our great goddess Artemis! And we’re the ones who guard her statue that fell down from the sky.\f + \fr 19:35 \fk statue... from the sky \ft Probably a rock or meteorite that the people thought looked like Artemis, the idol that they worshiped.\f*
\v 36 And no one will deny that, of course. Because of that we should be calm. Don’t rush to take action.
\v 37 You brought these two men here for no reason, because they haven’t stolen anything from the temple of our goddess, and they haven’t insulted her either.
\v 38 So if Demetrius and his coworkers are angry with someone, they should take that matter to the council of law— where the two parties can point out their own accusations before the judges in an orderly way.
\v 39 And if you still have other issues, we can settle those later in an official council of citizens,
\v 40 because our authorities in the Roman government could accuse us for making this disturbance today. If they ask, ‘Why did you cause that riot?’— we couldn’t give a reason.”
\v 41 After he said that, he ordered them to disperse. And they all left.
