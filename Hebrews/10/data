\c 10
\s Only Christ’s sacrifice fulfills God’s will and purifies us perfectly
\p
\v 1 So the way to worship God, which was written in the Law, was only a picture or shadow of the good things God planned to reveal to His people at the time set by Him. The old way of worshiping God didn’t show the true will of God. For under the old way, even though sacrifices of animals were offered every year, they couldn’t perfectly cleanse the worshipers’ consciences.
\v 2 For if the consciences of the worshipers had really been cleansed through the animal sacrifices mentioned, then they would definitely not have felt convicted of their sins anymore. And if so, they wouldn’t feel it was necessary to offer animal sacrifices anymore, of course.
\v 3 Instead, what happened is that those sacrifices made them remember their sins every time they offered them.
\v 4 For the offerings of the blood of bulls and goats couldn’t actually erase the sin of man.
\p
\v 5 That’s why, when Christ came to this world He said to God,
\q1 “You don’t want sacrifices and offerings,
\q2 but You have prepared a body for Me in order to serve you completely.
\q1
\v 6 You aren’t pleased with sacrifices to erase sin,
\q2 even when every part of the animal offering is burned up.
\q1
\v 7 For that reason, I say, ‘Yes God, I’m ready!
\q2 As it is written about Me in the Holy Bible,
\q2 I have come to do Your will.’”\x + \xo 10:7 \xt Ps. 40:7-9\x*
\m
\v 8 First of all, in the quote above, Christ said that God didn’t want and wasn’t pleased with ‘sacrifices and offerings,’ and all kinds of ‘sacrifices to erase sin’, including even the sacrifices where ‘the animal was burned up’. But that’s exactly what was commanded in the Law.
\v 9 Then He said, “Yes God, I am ready! I have come to do Your will.” So in saying that, Christ cancelled the old way to erase sin, and made a new way.
\v 10 For what God desired was that we be purified, forever, with the one-time sacrifice of Christ Jesus’ body alone.
\p
\v 11 With the old system, each priest had to stand before the altar in the Lord’s Tabernacle everyday, and repeatedly perform the religious requirements, and give different kinds of sacrifices which could never ever erase sin.
\v 12 Whereas, our High Priest Christ offered just one sacrifice, which is valid forever, and then He sat at the most honored place beside God.
\v 13 And now He awaits “the moment when God makes all of His enemies submit to Him.”\x + \xo 10:13 \xt Ps. 110:1; Heb. 1:13\x*
\v 14 So by offering just one sacrifice, Christ has perfectly cleansed us from sin forever. It’s the same in our daily lives, we are purified by Him more and more.
\p
\v 15 And the Holy Spirit also says the same thing to us in the verse I quoted. For He said earlier,
\q1
\v 16 “This is the word of the Lord.
\q2 This is the new promise that I will set up later on with you people of Israel:
\q1 I will put My law in your minds,
\q2 and I will write My law in your hearts.”\x + \xo 10:16 \xt Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10\x*
\m
\v 17 Then He said,
\q1 “I won’t remember your sins or evil anymore.”\x + \xo 10:17 \xt Jer. 31:34; Heb. 8:12\x*
\m
\v 18 So if all of that has been forgiven, then it isn’t necessary to offer sacrifices to erase sin anymore.
\s Let’s come to God freely in prayer
\p
\v 19 For that reason, Brothers and sisters, because of the blood of Jesus, we may enter the holy worship center in heaven without feeling afraid!
\v 20 For the way to enter that place used to be closed to us by a cloth curtain, and now a new way has been opened for us by our Middle-man Jesus. And His own Body, which is a living door, is the entrance for us.
\v 21 And now, because our High Priest rules over all the people of God,
\v 22 let’s come freely to God in our own prayers, without feeling afraid, with hearts that have been made perfect, and believing completely in Him. For our hearts have been, in a spiritual way, sprinkled with a liquid that purifies our consciences from the burden of sin and feelings of guilt. And our bodies have been cleansed in a spiritual way with pure water.
\v 23 Let’s firmly hold onto our faith, that is to all the things that we hope for and acknowledge! For He is very faithful to fulfill everything that He has promised.
\s Let’s hold onto our faith in God firmly and remain faithful to Him
\p
\v 24 For that reason, let’s all think about how to motivate each other, and remind each other to show love and do good things.
\v 25 Let’s not become lazy about getting together in our fellowship, like what has become the usual way for some of us. Instead, let’s motivate each other to remain zealous to get together, and be even more zealous because we realize that the day of Christ’s coming is getting closer.
\p
\v 26 For if we continue to commit sin on purpose, after we’ve received the true news about all that Christ has done for us, then there is no other sacrifice that can erase that sin.
\v 27 Whoever of us lives like that, just waits for God to impose the last terrifying judgment, when He will judge everyone who opposes Him, and throw them into the fire which has been prepared to destroy them.
\v 28 For example, remember what was done under the old system. Whoever broke the Law was killed without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three eye witnesses.
\v 29 So try to imagine how people who insult God’s Son deserve to be punished! People like that claim to be followers of Christ, but they keep living in sin. They consider the blood of Jesus that purifies us to be insignificant, which is the blood that He poured out to make the new promise with God legtimate. And in that way, they insult God’s Spirit, who gave the Good News about the kindness of God to us.
\v 30 People like that will definitely not escape from punishment, for we know who God truly is. He is the one who said,
\q1 “I am the one who has the right to repay evil. Let Me be the only one who repays.”
\m And the Lord said again,
\q1 “I the Lord will judge My people.”\x + \xo 10:30 \xt Deut. 32:36\x*
\m
\v 31 Watch out fearfully! Don’t be struck by the wrath of the living God!
\p
\v 32 But I’m asking each of you not to forget what happened when God first enlightened your hearts to know Christ. Even though you suffered terribly, you kept standing firm.
\v 33 Some of you were insulted in public, and even beaten. And there are also those who helped our brothers and sisters who have been persecuted like that.
\v 34 And when our brothers and sisters in the faith were imprisoned, you sympathized with their suffering, as if you yourselves were imprisoned. In fact, there are those among you who were persecuted to the point that your possessions were taken away. You remained joyful even in that situation, because you know that you have heavenly treasure that is guaranteed, which lasts forever.
\p
\v 35 So keep on being brave, and don’t let anyone let go of his faith in Christ which you have held onto firmly until now. For your faith will produce a great reward.
\v 36 It’s important for us now to remain patient in suffering, so that we keep doing God’s will. In that way we will receive everything that God has promised to us.
\v 37 For as it is written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 “In just a short time, He who is coming
\q2 will arrive and won’t delay any longer.
\q1
\v 38 The one who is righteous before Me, will live forever, because he believes completely in Me.
\q2 But I won’t be happy with the person who forsakes Me when he experiences trouble.”\f + \fr 10:37-38 \fk quote \ft The writer of Hebrews quotes from Hab. 2:3-4. Verse 38a is also quoted by the Apostle Paul in Rom. 1:17 and Gal. 3:11, but the writer of Hebrews quotes from the Septuagint, which adds the word ‘I’.\f*
\m
\v 39 Brothers and sisters, I’m sure that we aren’t people who ‘forsake’ the Lord and are destroyed. But we are people who ‘fully believe’ in Him, and are saved.
