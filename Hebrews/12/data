\s How to endure in the race of faith
\p
\v 1 Because of all of that, Brothers and sisters, let’s remember and follow the way of life of the heroes of our faith who have gone before us, and are now waiting for us! So let’s take off and leave behind every burden and sin that hinders us in the race that God has determined for us to run, and let’s keep fighting on to reach our goal.
\v 2 In this race, may our eyes keep looking ahead to Jesus. He’s the King, and the most important Hero of the Faith for us, and He finished the race that was given to Him with perfection. He was willing to endure very shameful suffering on the cross because He kept looking ahead to the joy that was prepared for Him on a later day. Now He is sitting, waiting for us in the place of greatest honor beside the throne of God.
\v 3 For that reason, let’s always meditate on the example of Jesus, who stood firm when sinful people insulted and persecuted Him so cruelly. If we follow Jesus’ example, we won’t get weary easily and give up.
\v 4 For of course, in our fight against sin, we haven’t been killed yet.
\p
\v 5 Let’s not forget the advice given by the Lord, where He calls each of us “My child.” He said,
\q1 “My child, don’t regard My discipline lightly.
\q2 And don’t give up when I rebuke you.
\q1
\v 6 For I discipline every child that I love,
\q2 and I spank everyone that I accept as a child.”\x + \xo 12:6 \xt Prov. 3:11-12\x*
\p
\v 7 So when we suffer because of our heavenly Father’s spanking, we have to remember that God is treating us like His children. For it isn’t unusual for a father to discipline his own child!
\v 8 If you are never corrected by the Lord, it means you aren’t His legitimate child. For the Lord corrects all of His children.
\v 9 Our fathers who are on this earth have corrected us, of course. After that we respected them. So let’s submit to God as our spiritual Father even more, because if we endure testing, we’ll enter eternal life.
\v 10 And our fathers, who are on this earth, corrected each of us for just a short time, according to what they consider to be good. But when our heavenly Father corrects us, it’s always fitting and useful, so that we’re purified, just like He is pure.
\v 11 Of course every time we’re corrected, the experience doesn’t make us happy, but makes us sad. But after we’re trained by that experience, the result is that we live more righteously, and we feel calm in the eyes of God.
\p
\v 12 So because we’ve been called to run in this race, let’s strengthen our weak arms, and let’s not allow our knees to shake.
\v 13 And may our legs keep running straight ahead! Don’t turn to the left or right! In that way, if a weak or lame person follows our example, their legs won’t go out of joint because of tripping, but they will be healed and strengthened more and more.
\s Don’t reject God’s kindness
\p
\v 14 Try to live peacefully with everyone! Try to live holy too! For anyone who doesn’t try to live holy won’t see the Lord.
\v 15 Be on guard so that none of you stops holding onto the kindness of God. Because if someone is like that, he’ll become like a poisonous plant that can poison others of us so that they’re infected with his uncleanness.
\v 16 And you also have to be on guard so that none of you lives immorally and doesn’t respect God like Esau did. As the firstborn son, he was the one who actually had the right to inherit all of his father’s wealth when his father died. But he sold all that wealth for just a dish of food.
\v 17 Remember what happened then. When he changed his mind, and wanted to receive his father’s blessing as the firstborn son, his father refused to give him that blessing. Even though he cried, he couldn’t change anything that he’d already done.
\s God’s old promise frightens, but the new promise gives joy
\p
\v 18 We, who come to God through Christ according to the new promise, aren’t like the people of Israel who received the old promise. They approached an earthly mountain, Mount Sinai. They were very afraid because the weather suddenly became cloudy, they were covered by darkness, and struck by a strong wind, and the mountain was burned with a blazing fire.
\v 19 Then they heard the piercing sound of a heavenly trumpet, and the voice of God Himself. Our forefathers became so frightened that they asked Moses that God not speak directly to them again.
\v 20 Because they were so afraid that they couldn’t endure the command of God, which was,
\q1 “If a person or an animal even touches this mountain, it has to be stoned to death.”\x + \xo 12:20 \xt Ex. 19:12-13\x*
\v 21 And of course, what they saw was so frightening that Moses himself even said,
\q1 “I’m really afraid and shaking.”\x + \xo 12:21 \xt Deut. 9:19\x*
\p
\v 22-23 Instead, we’ve come to God spiritually through the new promise. And we’ve been brought by Christ to the new Mount Zion, which is the heavenly Jerusalem and the home of the living God. We’re joyfully welcomed as citizens of the kingdom of heaven by thousands of angels, for we come through the First Son of God and inherit everything together with Him. We are the church of God’s Son, and each of our names are written in the book of life in heaven. We are accepted by God, who will judge everyone, and we now enter into the fellowship of all the righteous people who have gone ahead of us and have been made perfect.
\v 24 And Jesus, who is the Middle-man of the new promise from God, accepts us. In a spiritual way, we have been sprinkled with the blood of Jesus, which cleanses our consciences from sin. The blood of Abel, the first person killed, didn't bring blessing, but a curse. But the blood of Jesus brings great blessing!
\p
\v 25 So Brothers and sisters, let’s guard ourselves so that none of us refuses to listen to God who is speaking to us from heaven. For if our forefathers didn’t avoid being punished when they received the message from God through the earthly middle-man, Moses, we surely deserve to receive a harsher punishment if we refuse to hear Him who is now speaking to us from heaven!
\v 26 At the time God spoke to our forefathers on Mount Sinai, His voice made the earth shake. But now He has promised this,
\q1 “I’ll shake the earth once more, and not just the earth, but the sky and heaven too.”\x + \xo 12:26 \xt Hag. 2:6\x*
\m
\v 27 By saying “once more,” it’s clear that God means that everything that was created, which can be shaken, will be destroyed so that the things that can’t be shaken will remain.
\p
\v 28 So Brothers and sisters, because we’ve become citizens of God’s kingdom which can’t be shaken, we should be thankful to Him. And let’s please God by worshiping Him full of fear and respect.
\v 29 Because our God is, as the Holy Bible says, “a fire which burns up everything that isn’t perfect.”\x + \xo 12:29 \xt Deut. 4:24, 9:3\x*
