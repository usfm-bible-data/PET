\s Paul asks the church for prayer support
\p
\v 1 Finally, Brothers and Sisters, I ask you to pray for us so that our teaching about the Lord Jesus can spread quickly. Pray that people will receive that teaching and appreciate it, just like what happened among you.
\v 2 Pray also that God delivers us from agitators and people who are cruel to us, because not everyone wants to believe our teaching.
\p
\v 3 But the Lord Jesus is always faithful. He will strengthen the faith of each of you and protect you from the devil.
\v 4 And because you are also one with the Lord, we’re also confident that you are doing, and will keep doing what we taught.
\v 5 We pray that the Lord Jesus will help you to be more certain that God really loves you, and that you can keep on enduring like Christ did when He suffered.
\s We must work
\p
\v 6 Brothers and Sisters, as messengers of our Lord Christ Jesus, we command that you not associate with a brother or sister in the faith who is lazy and who doesn’t want to live according to the teaching you received from us.
\v 7 I ask you to always remember our way of life when we were together, and to follow our example, because we were never lazy.
\v 8 Remember that we never ate other people’s food without paying. We worked hard day and night so that we wouldn’t become a burden to any of you.
\v 9 Actually, as the Lord's servants we have the right to receive help from you. But we ourselves worked to meet our needs because we wanted to become examples to you.
\v 10 And when we were still together, we commanded you like this, “Whoever doesn’t want to work, can’t eat.”
\p
\v 11 We remind you about that because we hear that there are some people among you who are lazy. They don’t work at all, but are just busy meddling in other people’s affairs.
\v 12 As servants of our Lord Christ Jesus, we strongly advise that they live orderly, and that they must work for a living to fulfill the basic necessities for themselves.
\v 13 And Brothers and Sisters, we urge all of you not to be tired of doing good.
\p
\v 14 If there are people who don’t follow what we teach in this letter, take note of who they are and don’t have close relationships with them. In that way, they will become aware and ashamed of their wrongs.
\v 15 But don’t consider them to be enemies. Keep advising them as brothers and sisters in the faith.
\s Final words
\p
\v 16 Finally, we pray for you to the Lord Jesus who always gives us calmness in His protection.
\p
\v 17 I, Paul, am the one writing this final greeting with my own hand. Greetings! This is what I usually do as a sign that this letter is really from me.
\p
\v 18 And I pray that our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to all of you.
