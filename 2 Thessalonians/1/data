\v 1 Dear Brothers and Sisters in the faith in the congregation at Thessalonica whom I love, that is you who’ve been made one with God our Father and our Lord Christ Jesus.
\p Greetings from Paul, Silas\f + \fr 1:1 \fk Silas \ft Literally, “Silvanus.”\f* and Timothy.
\p
\v 2 My prayer is that God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus will always be kind to each of you and watch over you so that you live calmly under the protection of our Lord and Father.
\s Paul comforts the congregation in persecution
\p
\v 3 We always give thanks to God because of you, Brothers and Sisters. And we feel it’s very proper to do that because your faith in Jesus keeps growing, and you all love each other more and more.
\v 4 So we’re always glad to tell about you to the other churches, that is to those who are chosen by God like you and us. We tell them how you keep enduring and holding on to your faith when you're persecuted, and how you suffer many things.
\p
\v 5 The way you endure like that proves that God always treats mankind with justice, so that you are shown to be worthy to enter God’s kingdom. For you are suffering now, of course, because you are faithful to His kingdom.
\v 6 When God gives a harsh punishment to those who are making you suffer now, He’ll also do it with justice.
\v 7 At that time, He’ll also give you who are suffering a feeling of relief, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus returns from heaven and shows Himself again to this world. At that time, His angels will accompany Him with amazing power.
\v 8 And everyone who doesn’t know God and doesn’t want to obey the Good News about our Lord Jesus will be punished by Him with flaming fire.\f + \fr 1:8 \fk everyone who doesn’t know…flaming fire \ft Paul writes words that are almost the same as Ps. 79:6; Is. 66:15; and Jer. 10:25.\f*
\v 9 They’ll be punished forever in a place that is far from the presence of the LORD, and they won’t be able to enjoy the glory of God and all of His power forever.\f + \fr 1:9 \fk in a place that’s far…all His power \ft Paul writes words that are almost the same as Is. 2:10, 19.\f*
\v 10 That punishment will happen when the Lord Jesus comes back. At that time, everyone who has been purified by Him, that is everyone who believes in Him, will feel amazed and glorify Him because of His power. You will also certainly join in welcoming His coming because you’ve believed the testimony that we’ve given.
\p
\v 11 For that reason we always pray for you. And we ask God to help you to live in a way that’s proper for people who’ve been called by Him. And we pray that through the power of God, you will be enabled to complete all the good things that you desire to do, especially the good things that are proper for us who believe in Jesus.
\v 12 In that way, the name of Jesus our Lord will be glorified through each of your lives. And because you are one with Him, you’ll also be honored according to the kindness of God the Father and our Lord Christ Jesus.
