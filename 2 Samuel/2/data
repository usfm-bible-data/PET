\s David appointed king over the tribe of Judah
\p
\v 1 Some time later, David asked the LORD, "Should I go to a city in Judah?"
\p The LORD answered him, "Yes, go."
\p David asked, "To which city shall I go?"
\p The LORD answered, "Hebron."
\p
\v 2 Then David went to Hebron with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel.
\v 3 David also brought his troops, each with all their families. And they settled in Hebron and in the villages around that city.
\v 4 Then some men from the tribe of Judah came to David. They anointed David and appointed him king over the tribe of Judah.
\p After David was told that the people of Benjamin from the city of Jabesh in the region of Gilead had buried Saul's body,
\v 5 David sent a messenger to them to say, "May the LORD bless you, because you have shown your loyalty to Saul, your master, by burying his body.
\v 6 May the LORD show his faithfulness to you, and I will also do so toward you, because you have done good to Saul.
\v 7 [** With the death of our lord Saul, I have been appointed king by the tribe of Judah, and I beg you to be strong and dare to support me too."
\s Ishbosheth, son of Saul, becomes king
\p
\v 8 While this was happening, the commander of Saul's army, Abner son of Ner, had already brought Ishbosheth, son of Saul, to Mahanaim\x + \xo 2:8 \xt Gen. 32:2; Jos. 13:26, 30 \x*
\v 9 to appoint him king over the region of Gilead, and Jezreel, and the tribe of Asher,\f + \fr 2:9 \fk Asher \ft The Masoretic text has 'the Assyrians', but the spelling refers to the land of Assyria (Syria), and that can't be true. Two solutions were proposed with minor spelling changes, namely the territory of the tribe of 'Asher' (which is located on the western and northern ends of Israel, next to the Mediterranean Sea), and 'the people of Geshur' (a small region east of the Sea of Galilee).\f* Ephraim, and Benjamin. Thus Ishbosheth became king over all Israel, except for the tribe of Judah.
\p
\v 10 Ishbosheth was 40 years old when he began to rule over Israel, and he reigned for two years. However, the tribe of Judah remained loyal to David.
\v 11 David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah for seven years and six months.

\s Wars between the tribes of Judah and other tribes of Israel
\p
\v 12 One day Abner and the troops of Ishbosheth came out of Mahanaim to the city of Gibeon.
\v 13 At the same time, Joab the son of Zeruiah,\f + \fr 2:13 \fk Zeruiah \ft Zeruiah was David's sister, so Joab was David's nephew.\f* led David's army out to confront Ishbosheth's troops at the pool of Gibeon. Abner's company was on one side of the pool, and Joab's were on the other side.
\p
\v 14 Abner said to Joab, "Let our men come and fight before us."
\p Joab said, "Very well!"
\v 15 So these men were chosen to come forward: twelve men from the tribe of Benjamin representing Ishbosheth, son of Saul, and twelve representing the side of David.
\v 16 When they came face to face with each other, they grabbed each other's heads and thrust their swords into each other's stomachs, so that the twenty-four who had come forward died together. That is why that place in Gibeon was named the Sword Field.
\p
\v 17 The battle was very fierce. Abner and the army of Israel were defeated by David's army.
\p
\v 18 Three sons of Zeruiah were in the battle. They were Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel was able to run as fast as a deer.
\v 19 Asahel continued to chase and follow Abner without stopping.
\v 20 Then Abner looked back and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?!"
\q1 Asahel answered, "Yes, it's me!"
\p
\v 21 Abner said to him, “Stop chasing me! Kill one of the other soldiers and take all the equipment from the corpse!" But Asahel refused to stop chasing Abner.
\p
\v 22 So Abner said once again to Asahel, “Stop chasing me! I don't want to kill you! How can I face your brother Joab?!”
\v 23 But Asahel refused to stop. So when Asahel approached Abner from behind, Abner thrust the tip of his spear back into Asahel's stomach so that it penetrated his back. Then Asahel fell in that place and died. All the soldiers on David's side who saw Asahel killed stopped chasing the enemy to see his body.
\p
\v 24 When they heard what had happened to Asahel, Joab, Abishai, and the soldiers who were with them continued to pursue Abner and his surviving troops. At sunset Abner's army arrived at the hill of Ammah, near Giah, on the road leading into the wilderness of Gibeon.
\v 25 There the soldiers of the tribe of Benjamin gathered behind Abner and arranged their ranks on the hill.
\p
\v 26 Then Abner cried out to Joab, “Will we always finish an issue between us with a sword?! Don't you realize that the only thing that will remain is us holding grudges against each other! When are you going to order your troops to stop chasing their fellow brothers?!”
\p
\v 27 Joab answered, "By the God who lives, if you had not just said that, then I and my troops would not have stopped chasing you all night long even until morning! Even though we are brothers."
\v 28 Then Joab blew the trumpet, and all his troops stopped pursuing and fighting with the Israelite forces.
\p
\v 29 All that night Abner and his troops returned through the Jordan Valley. Then they crossed the Jordan River and walked all that morning until they came to Mahanaim.
\p
\v 30 After Joab returned from pursuing Abner, he gathered and counted David's army. Nineteen soldiers died in the war, apart from Asahel.
\v 31 But David's army killed three hundred and sixty of Abner's army, all of them from the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 32 They took Asahel's body to the cemetery of his family in Bethlehem and buried him there. Joab and his men walked all night, and came back to Hebron at dawn.
