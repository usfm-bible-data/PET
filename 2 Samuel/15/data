\s Absalom rebels
\p
\v 1 Sometime after this, Absalom prepared a chariot, complete with horses and fifty men running as bodyguards in front of him.
\v 2 Every day Absalom used to come early in the morning to the side of the road leading to the palace gate. Whenever someone was about to go to the king to complain about his problem, Absalom always called that person and asked, "Hey friend, what city are you from?" Then the man told the city and his tribe.
\v 3 Absalom then said to him, “I am sure your case is legitimate and worthy of being heard. But unfortunately the king has not assigned a single official to handle your complaint."
\v 4 Ah, if I were a judge in this country, everyone could come to me to settle the case, and I would have handled it fairly."
\p
\v 5 Also, when anyone approached Absalom to bow down in honor of him, Absalom always stretched out his hand and embraced and greeted him warmly.
\v 6 In this way Absalom treated all Israelites who came to the king to seek justice for his case. In this way Absalom succeeded in making the Israelites like him.
\p
\v 7 After doing this for four years, Absalom said to the king, “Father, let me go to the city of Hebron to fulfill a special promise that I have made to the Lord.
\v 8 I made this promise while still living in the city of Geshur, in the land of Syria. I used to promise, ‘If God allows me to return to Jerusalem, then I will worship Him by offering many sacrifices to Him in Hebron.’"
\p
\v 9 The king answered him, "Yes, go safely."
\p So Absalom leaves for Hebron
\v 10-12 He invited two hundred people from Jerusalem to share in the banquet of the sacrifice he was giving. They left without knowing Absalom's plan. At the time the sacrifices were being offered and the banquet began, Absalom sent a messenger to the city of Gilo to summon Ahithophel, David's adviser. Then the conspiracy to rebel against King David grew stronger and the people supported Absalom even more. Absalom had also sent secret envoys to all the tribes of Israel with the message, "When you hear the trumpet sound, shout, 'Absalom is already king in Hebron!'"
\s David flees from Jerusalem
\p
\v 13 A man came with a message to David, saying, "Many Israelites have joined Absalom in rebelling against the King!"
\p
\v 14 Then David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come on! We have to escape right now! Otherwise, Absalom will all kill us! Hurry up, before he comes to attack and slaughter all the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
\p
\v 15 The servants replied, "We are ready to carry out orders, sir!"
\p
\v 16 So the king immediately set out on foot, and all the members of the family and his servants followed him. David only left ten concubines to guard the palace.
\v 17 They went to the last house on the edge of town. There David stopped, looking at whoever was in his group.
\v 18 They passed by in front of David, who was all his servants and the king's guard. There were also six hundred mercenaries among the guards who came from Gath. Their commander is Ittai.
\v 19-20 David said to Ittai, “You are immigrants in Israel, and recently moved from your homeland. You better not come with us. Come back and stay under the leadership of the new king. I don't want to trouble you by wandering with us, because I don't even know where to go. Come back to town with your troops. May the LORD always be with you and show you his loyalty!"
\p
\v 21 But Ittai answered, "I swear before the living Lord that as long as your Lord is living, whatever you face, whether life is difficult or danger of death, I will always be with you. Your servant will be faithful to death."
\p
\v 22 Then David answered, "Fine, then come along." So Ittai the Gittite went with David, accompanied by his troops and their families.
\p
\v 23 All the inhabitants wept loudly when the king's party left the city. David and all his followers crossed the Kidron River.\f + \fr 15:23 \fk Kidron River \ft The Kidron River was considered the eastern boundary of the city of Jerusalem in those days. The Kidron river is the beginning of the Kidron Valley which stretches from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea.\f* and follows a road that leads into the wilderness.
\p
\v 24 Priest Zadok and Abiathar also arrived at the city border with some of the tribe of Levi who brought God's covenant chest. They placed the covenant chest there, and Abiathar offered several sacrifices until the entire king's party had left the city.
\p
\v 25 The king said to Zadok, “Bring back God's covenant chest to the city. If God is pleased with me, He must have let me go home so I could see His chest and tabernacle again.
\v 26 However, if God is not pleased, I am willing to accept whatever His will for my life, let it happen."
\p
\v 27 David also said to Zadok, "You must understand what is happening. Return to the city safely with Abiathar and your two sons, Ahimas and Jonathan.\x + \xo 15:27 \xt 2Sam. 15: 36\x*
\v 28 I will wait in the wilderness, at the crossing of the Jordan River, until I hear from you. "
\v 29 So Zadok and Abiathar brought God's covenant back to Jerusalem and they remained there.
\p
\v 30 As David climbed the Mount of Olives, he walked, weeping. His head was closed in mourning and he was barefoot. Everyone who was with him also covered their heads and cried.
\v 31 When King David heard the news that Ahithophel had joined Absalom's conspiracy, he prayed, "LORD, fail Ahithophel's advice."
\p
\v 32 When David arrived at the top of the hill, where people used to offer sacrifices to God, he was met by Hushai, who was a friend of the Arki tribe.\f + \fr 15:32 \fk the Arki tribe \ft the tribe of Benjamin. According to Jos. 16:2 Their dwelling place is on the southern border of the land of the tribe of Ephraim, near Bethel.\f*
\v 33 David said to him, “If you come with me, you will not be able to help me.
\v 34 But if you go back to Jerusalem, you will fail Ahithophel's advice. Pretend to Absalom by saying, 'I will be your servant, O King! As I served your father, so now I will serve you.'
\v 35 Zadok the priest and Abiathar are still in town. Tell them everything you heard in the palace.
\v 36 Ahimas the son of Zadok, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, will convey this information to me."
\p
\v 37 So Hushai, the friend of David, returned to Jerusalem. He arrived just as Absalom was entering the city.
