\s Absalom rebels
\p
\v 1 Sometime after this, Absalom prepared a chariot, complete with horses and fifty men running as bodyguards in front of him.
\v 2 Every day Absalom would come early in the morning to the side of the road leading to the palace gate. Whenever someone was about to go to the king to complain about his problem, Absalom always called that person and asked, "Hey friend, what city are you from?" Then the man told the city and his tribe.
\v 3 Absalom then said to him, “I am sure your case is legitimate and worthy of being heard. But unfortunately the king has not assigned a single official to handle your complaint."
\v 4 Ah, if I were a judge in this country, everyone could come to me to settle his case, and I would certainly handle it fairly."
\p
\v 5 Also, when anyone approached Absalom to bow down to honor him, Absalom always stretched out his hand and embraced and greeted him warmly.
\v 6 In this way Absalom treated all Israelites who came to the king to seek justice for his case. In this way Absalom succeeded in making the Israelites like him.
\p
\v 7 After doing this for four years, Absalom said to the king, “Father, let me go to the city of Hebron to fulfill a special promise that I have made to the LORD.
\v 8 I made this promise while still living in the city of Geshur, in the land of Syria. I used to promise, ‘If the LORD allows me to return to Jerusalem, then I will worship Him by offering many sacrifices to Him in Hebron.’"
\p
\v 9 The king answered him, "Yes, go safely."
\p So Absalom left for Hebron.
\v 10-12 He invited two hundred people from Jerusalem to share in the banquet of the sacrifice he was offering. They left without knowing Absalom's plan. At the time the sacrifices were being offered and the banquet began, Absalom sent a messenger to the city of Giloh to summon Ahithophel, David's adviser. Then the conspiracy to rebel against King David grew stronger and the people supported Absalom even more. Absalom had also sent secret envoys to all the tribes of Israel with the message, "When you hear the trumpet sound, shout, 'Absalom is king in Hebron!'"
\s David flees from Jerusalem
\p
\v 13 A man came with a message to David, saying, "Many Israelites have joined Absalom in rebelling against the King!"
\p
\v 14 Then David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come on! We have to escape right now! Otherwise, Absalom will kill us all! Hurry up, before he comes to attack and slaughter all the inhabitants of Jerusalem."
\p
\v 15 The servants replied, "We are ready to carry out orders, sir!"
\p
\v 16 So the king immediately set out on foot, and all the members of the family and his servants followed him. David only left ten concubines to watch the palace.
\v 17 They went to the last house on the edge of town. There David stopped, looking at who was in his group.
\v 18 They passed by in front of David, that is all his servants and the king's guard. There were also six hundred mercenaries among the guards who came from Gath. Their commander was Ittai.
\v 19-20 David said to Ittai, “You are immigrants in Israel, and recently moved from your homeland. You better not come with us. Go back and stay under the leadership of the new king. I don't want to trouble you by wandering with us, because I don't even know where to go. Go back to town with your troops. May the LORD always be with you and show you his faithfulness!"
\p
\v 21 But Ittai answered, "I swear before the living LORD that as long as my Lord the King is living, whatever you face, whether life is difficult or there is danger of death, I will always be with you. Your servant will be faithful unto death."
\p
\v 22 Then David answered, "Fine, then come along." So Ittai the Gittite went with David, accompanied by his troops and their families.
\p
\v 23 All the inhabitants wept loudly when the king's party left the city. David and all his followers crossed the Kidron River\f + \fr 15:23 \fk Kidron River \ft The Kidron River was considered the eastern boundary of the city of Jerusalem in those days. The Kidron River is the beginning of the Kidron Valley which stretches from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea.\f* and followed a road that led into the wilderness.
\p
\v 24 Zadok the priest and Abiathar also arrived at the border of the city with some from the tribe of Levi who brought the chest of the covenant of God. They placed the chest of the covenant there, and Abiathar offered several sacrifices until the entire party of the king had left the city.
\p
\v 25 The king said to Zadok, “Bring back the chest of the covenant of God to the city. If the LORD is pleased with me, He will certainly allow me to come home so I can see His chest and tabernacle again.
\v 26 However, if the LORD is not pleased, I am willing to accept whatever His will for my life is, let it happen."
\p
\v 27 David also said to Zadok, "You certainly understand what is happening. Return to the city safely with Abiathar and your two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan.\x + \xo 15:27 \xt 2 Sam. 15:36\x*
\v 28 I will wait in the wilderness, at the crossing of the Jordan River, until I hear from you."
\v 29 So Zadok and Abiathar brought the chest of the covenant of God back to Jerusalem and they remained there.
\p
\v 30 As David climbed the Mount of Olives, he walked, weeping. His head was covered in mourning and he was barefoot. Everyone who was with him also covered their heads and cried.
\v 31 When King David heard the news that Ahithophel had joined Absalom's conspiracy, he prayed, "LORD, cause Ahithophel's advice to fail."
\p
\v 32 When David arrived at the top of the hill, where people used to offer sacrifices to God, he was met by Hushai, who was his friend from the Arkite tribe.\f + \fr 15:32 \fk the Arkite tribe \ft The Arkite tribe was a part of the tribe of Benjamin. According to Jos. 16:2 Their dwelling place was on the southern border of the land of the tribe of Ephraim, near Bethel.\f*
\v 33 David said to him, “If you come with me, you will not be able to help me.
\v 34 But if you go back to Jerusalem, you can cause Ahithophel's advice to fail. Pretend before Absalom saying, 'I will be your servant, O King! As I served your father, so now I will serve you.'
\v 35 Zadok the priest and Abiathar are still in town. Tell them everything you hear in the palace.
\v 36 Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, will convey this information to me."
\p
\v 37 So Hushai, the friend of David, returned to Jerusalem. He arrived just as Absalom was entering the city.
