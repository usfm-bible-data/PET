\s The rebellion of Sheba
\p
\v 1 At Gilgal there was a man who often caused trouble named Sheba, son of Bicri, of the tribe of Benjamin. He blew the trumpet for everyone to hear his announcement then cried out over and over,
\q1 “Listen, Israelites!
\q2 We must not submit to David, son of Jesse!
\q1 Let him rule the tribe of Judah alone.
\q2 Let's just go home!”
\p
\v 2 So all the people of the tribes of Israel left David and followed Sheba. It was only the people of Judah who continued to accompany the king from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 When David arrived at his palace, he ordered that the ten concubines he had left to guard the palace be transferred to another house, always guarded by guards. The king gave them their necessities, but he never slept with them again. The women lived like widows until they died.
\p
\v 4 Then the king said to Amasa, "Call the whole army of Judah so that they gather here the day after tomorrow\f + \fr 20:4 \fk the day after tomorrow \ft More literally, the Hebrew text writes 'in three days'. According to the Jewish counting system, the day of giving an order was counted as the first day. And the day after tomorrow is counted as the third day.\f*."
\v 5 Amasa then went out to gather the people of Judah. But he did not return to the king at the appointed time.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, David said to Abishai, “Now, Sheba will make things more dangerous than Absalom. Therefore, take the troops that are with me and chase him, before he escapes to a fortified city, making it difficult to catch him."
\p
\v 7 So Abishai and his brother Joab set out to pursue Sheba with the army that was in Jerusalem with the king's guard.\f + \fr 20:7 \fk the king's guard, \ft The Hebrew text literally says 'the Cherethites and the the Pelethites'. See footnote on 2 Sam. 8:18.\f*
\v 8-9 When they came to a large rock that was in Gibeon, they met Amasa. Joab was wearing a military uniform and belt. A knife was attached to his belt. He immediately approached Amasa and embraced him\f + \fr 20:8-9 \fk embraced him \ft The Hebrew text literally says 'took hold of his beard to kiss him'.\f* with his right hand as if giving a warm greeting, but his left hand took the knife\f + \fr 20:8-9 \fk took… \ft The Hebrew text literally says 'knife/dagger…fell'. There are many interpretations of the way the "dropped" knife was taken into Joab's left hand. But no interpretation was written by an eye witness, and this murder could not have happened accidentally.\f* secretly while saying to Amasa, "Hi, Brother! How are you?"
\v 10 Amasa did not pay attention to the knife, and Joab immediately stabbed him in the stomach until his intestines came out and fell to the ground. Amasa died immediately with one stab. Then Joab and Abishai continued to pursue Sheba.
\p
\v 11-13 Amasa's body was lying in the middle of the road covered in blood. Joab had ordered one of his soldiers to stand by the corpse and cry out to the troops that were still passing by to chase Sheba, “Go! Keep on chasing! If you support Joab and King David, hurry up and follow Joab!” But when the man saw that all the passersby stopped to see Amasa's body, he removed it from the road and covered it with clothes. After that, all the troops just passed by and joined Joab.
\p
\v 14 Meanwhile, Sheba, son of Bicri, had already visited the ten tribal regions of Israel to instigate a revolt. Finally, he assembled an army from his extended family and with them entered the city of Abel Beth Maacah.\f + \fr 20:14 \fk his extended family ...Abel Beth Maacah \ft The Hebrew text gives the name of the extended family of Sheba, which can written Beri or Bicri. The Hebrew text for the name of the city Abel Beth Maacah can also be translated 'Abel and Beth Maacah'. The city is located on Israel's northern border.\f*
\v 15 At this, Joab and his troops began to surround the city by making piles of earth to rise above the fortress of the city, and using large beams to break down the fortress. They had started destroying the fort walls when
\v 16 a wise woman called Joab from the top of the fort, “Attention! Attention, please! Please call Joab, I need to talk to him."
\v 17 Joab approached and the woman asked, "Are you Joab?"
\p Joab answered, "Yes."
\p Then the woman said to him, "Sir, please listen to me."
\p Joab replied, "Yes, please speak."
\p
\v 18 Then, the woman said, "There is an old saying, 'To settle matters fairly, seek advice from the wise people of the city of Abel.'
\v 19 We inhabitants of this city are faithful and peaceable citizens of the kingdom of Israel. Why destroy a city where many of the LORD's people were born?"
\p
\v 20 Joab replied, “I do not wish to destroy your city at all!
\v 21 That's not my goal. I came here to chase Sheba, son of Bicri, from the hills of Ephraim. He has led a rebellion against King David. Give him up, then I will go away from this city."
\p Then the wise woman said to Joab, “Very well. His head will be thrown to you from the top of this fortress."
\v 22 Then the woman spoke wisely to the townspeople. They took her advice, cut off Sheba's head and threw it to Joab. Then Joab blew his trumpet so that his troops would disperse and return to their places. Joab returned to Jerusalem to appear before King David.
