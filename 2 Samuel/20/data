\s The rebellion of Sheba
\p
\v 1 At Gilgal there was a man of trouble named Sheba, son of Bikri, of the tribe of Benjamin. He blew the trumpet for everyone to hear his announcement then cried out over and over,
\q1 “Listen, Israelites!
\q2 We must not submit to David, son of Jesse!
\q1 Let him rule the tribe of Judah alone.
\q2 Let's just go home!”
\p
\v 2 So all the people of the tribes of Israel left David and followed Sheba. Only the people of Judah remained with the king from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 When David arrived at his palace, he ordered that the ten concubines he had left to guard the palace be transferred to another house, always guarded by guards. The king gave them their necessities, but he never slept with them again. The women lived like widows until they died.
\p
\v 4 Then the king said to Amasa, "Call the whole army of Judah so that the day after tomorrow\f + \fr 20: 4 \fk the day after tomorrow 
\ft. The Hebrew text is more literally written 'in three days'. According to the Jewish counting system, the day of giving an order was counted as the first day. And the day after tomorrow is counted as the third day.\f* gathered here. "
\v 5 Amasa also went out to gather the people of Judah. But he did not return to the king at the appointed time.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, David said to Abishai, “Now, Sheba will make things more dangerous than Absalom. Therefore, take the troops that are with me and chase him, before he escapes to the fortified city, making it difficult to catch him."
\p
\v 7 So Abishai and his brother Joab set out to pursue Sheba with the army that was in Jerusalem with the king's guard.\f + \fr 20: 7 \fk the king's guard, \ft The Hebrew text literally says' the Cretans and the the Pleti 'people. See footnote on 2Sam. 8:18.\f*
\v 8-9 When they came to a large rock that was in Gibeon, they met Amasa. Joab was wearing a military uniform and belt. A knife was attached to his belt. He immediately approached Amasa and embraced him\f + \fr 20: 8-9 \fk embracing him \ft The Hebrew text literally says 'take a beard to kiss him'.\f* with his right hand as if giving a warm greeting, but his left hand takes the knife\f + \fr 20: 8-9 \fk took… \ft The Hebrew text literally says 'knife / dagger… fell'. There are many interpretations of the way the "dropped" knife was taken into Joab's left hand. But no interpretation was written by eye witnesses, and this murder could not have happened by chance.\f* secretly said to Amasa, "Hi, Brother! How are you?"
\v 10 Amasa did not pay attention to the knife, and Joab immediately stabbed him in the stomach until his intestines came out and fell to the ground. Amasa died immediately with one stab. Then Joab and Abishai continued to pursue Sheba.
\p
\v 11-13 Amasa's body was lying in the middle of the road covered in blood. Joab had already ordered one of his soldiers to stand by the corpse and cried out to the troops that were still passing by to chase Sheba, “Get away! Keep on chasing! If you support Joab and King David, hurry up and follow Joab!” But when the man saw that all the passersby stopped to see Amasa's body, he removed him from the road and covered it with clothes. After that, all the troops just passed by and joined Joab.
\p
\v 14 Meanwhile, Sheba, son of Bikri, had already visited the ten tribal regions of Israel to instigate a revolt. Finally, he assembled an army from his extended family and with them entered the city of Abel Bet Maaka.\f + \fr 20:14 \fk his extended family ... Abel Bet Maaka \ft The Hebrew text gives the name of the extended family of Sheba, which can written Beri or Bikri. The Hebrew text for the name of the city Abel Bet Maaka can also be translated 'Abel and Bet Maaka'. The city is located on Israel's northern border.\f*
\v 15 At this, Joab and his troops began to surround the city by making piles of earth to rise above the fortress of the city, and using large beams to break down the fortress. They had started destroying the fort walls when
\v 16 a wise woman called Joab from the top of the fort, “Watch out! Attention, please! Please call Joab, I need to talk to him."
\v 17 Joab approached and the woman asked, "Are you Joab?"
\p Joab answered, "Yes."
\p Then the woman said to him, "Sir, please listen to me."
\p Joab replied, "Yes, please speak."
\p
\v 18 Then, the woman said, "There is an old saying, 'To settle matters fairly, seek advice from the wise men of the city of Abel.'
\v 19 We inhabitants of this city are faithful and peaceable citizens of the kingdom of Israel. Why destroy a city where there are many of God's people are born?"
\p
\v 20 Joab replied, “I do not wish to destroy your city at all!
\v 21 That's not my goal. I came here to chase Sheba, son of Bikri, from the hills of Ephraim. He was already leading a rebellion against King David. Give him up, then I will go out of this city. "
\p Then the wise woman said to Joab, “Very well. His head will be thrown at the Lord from above this fortress. "
\v 22 Then the woman spoke wisely to the townspeople. They took his advice, cut off Sheba's head and threw it at Joab. Then Joab blew his trumpet so that his troops would disperse and return to their places. Joab returned to Jerusalem to appear before King David.
