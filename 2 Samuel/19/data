\s1 Joab rebukes King David
\p
\v 1 Then someone told Joab, "The king is weeping and mourning the death of Absalom."
\v 2 The soldiers also heard that the king was lamenting his son, so that the victory that day became an atmosphere of mourning.
\v 3 They return to the city in secret, like defeated soldiers and return home feeling ashamed.
\v 4 Meanwhile, the king covered his face with his hands and was still crying out loud, saying, "My son Absalom, oh my son Absalom, my son!"
\p
\v 5 Then Joab came to David and said, “Today, my Lord, the king has humiliated all of your soldiers, even though they have saved the lives of you, your children, and your wives and concubines!
\v 6 With this attitude, my Lord the King shows that our struggles are meaningless to you. It seems that you love your enemies more than we defend you! Now I know that if Absalom were still alive and we all died, Master would have been very happy!
\v 7 Therefore, get up and calm their hearts. Before the LORD I said honestly: If you don't thank them, they will be offended and leave you tonight! If so you will find trouble greater than any difficulty you have ever experienced!"
\p
\v 8 So David got up and sat down at the city gate. When it was announced to his troops that the king was sitting at the city gate, they all gathered before him.
\p Meanwhile, Absalom's men had fled to their homes (period needed?)
\v 9-10 All the tribes of Israel consulted by saying, “King David has saved us from the dominion of our enemies and the Philistines. But we instead choose Absalom to rule us. Now David has fled the land, while Absalom has died in battle. So what now? Shouldn't we make David our king again?"
\p
\v 11 King David heard the news about the opinion of the people. So he sent this message to priest Zadok and priest Abiathar, “Tell the elders of the tribe of Judah, 'I have heard the opinion of the people of Israel, except from you. Why haven't you agreed to take me back to the palace?
\v 12 You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. It is fitting that you were the first to come to escort me back to the palace.'
\v 13 Also convey to Amasa this way, 'We are close family. I swear: Let God punish me, even take my life, if I do not make you commander of the Israelite army to replace Joab! ""
\p
\v 14 So David succeeded in getting all the people of Judah to agree to support him, so that they sent a message to the king, "Lord, go home with the whole party of the Lord."
\s David returns to Jerusalem
\p
\v 15 So David departed and came to the bank of the Jordan River. Meanwhile, the men of Judah had reached Gilgal to welcome the king and help him cross the Jordan.
\v 16 Shimei,\x + \xo 19:16 \xt 2Sam. 16: 5-8\x* this man from the tribe of Benjamin, who had insulted David, also rushed down to the river to greet King David.
\v 17 With Shimei there were a thousand Benjaminites. In addition, Ziba the servant of the Saul family, along with his fifteen sons and twenty slaves, rushed into the Jordan River before the king crossed.
\v 18 They helped the royal family cross the river and were ready to do anything that could help David.
\s1 David has compassion on Shimei When he came to the other side of the river, Shimei bowed down before David
\v 19 and said, “Lord King, please don't keep remembering the mistakes of your servant and my actions on the day that you left Jerusalem! I beg you to forget all that!
\v 20 This servant realizes that I have sinned. Therefore, today I come as the first to represent all the tribes of Israel apart from Judah. \f + \fr 19:20 \fk the tribes of Israel… \ft Literally in the Hebrew text Shimei says 'Joseph's house (extended family)'. Since Shimei was not from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, of course he used it as a soft word meaning 'all the tribes of Israel apart from Judah,' and also so as not to focus on himself being from the tribe of Benjamin, the tribe of King Saul.\f* to welcome my Lord the King."
\p
\v 21 Hearing that, Abishai\x + \xo 19:21 \xt 2 Sam. 2:18\x* answered, "Shimei should be put to death because he has insulted the king chosen by the Lord."
\p
\v 22 But David said, "Be still, son of Zeruiah! It's none of your business to oppose me with your opinion! Today is not the day to condemn anyone's death sentence, because I was recently reinstated as king over Israel."
\v 23 Then David promised Shimei with an oath, "You will not be put to death."
\s1 David's kindness to Mephibosheth
\p
\v 24-25 Saul's grandson Mephibosheth, also came from Jerusalem to meet David. As a sign of grief, he did not clean his feet, did not straighten his mustache, and did not wash his clothes from the time King David left Jerusalem until he returned safely. David asked him, "Why didn't you come with me at that time, Mephibosheth?"
\p
\v 26 He answered, "My Lord the King [# know that //, you know] your servant is paralyzed. I [# already] ordered my slave [# Ziba // that] to prepare a donkey so I can [# ride it // ride it] and come with you. But he [# just] tricked me and went off alone.
\v 27 He even slandered the servant before the Lord. But my lord Raja is wise like an angel. Master will definitely know what to do in this situation.
\v 28 After all, all of my grandfather's descendants deserve to be executed by you. But by allowing your servant to eat at the Lord's table, you are treating me like a family member! Your servant is satisfied and does not need to ask for anything more."
\p
\v 29 Then the king answered him, “It is enough what you say. I have decided that Saul's land and property should be divided in half between you and Ziba."
\p
\v 30 Mephibosheth said, “It's okay! Let Ziba take it all! As long as my Lord the King has returned safely, I am happy."
\s David's kindness to Barzillai
\p
\v 31 Barzillai the Gileadite had come from Rogelim to lead David across the Jordan River.
\v 32 Barzillai is very old, he is eighty years old. He's a very rich man. As long as King David and his entourage lived in Mahanaim, he was the one who provided them with food and other necessities.
\v 33 David said to Barzillai, "Sir, come to Jerusalem, there I will meet all your needs."
\p
\v 34 But Barzillai answered, “Sir, your servant will not live much longer. There is no point in me going with you to Jerusalem.
\v 35 I am already eighty years old. I can no longer enjoy anything. My tongue can't taste good food or drink. My ears can no longer hear the voices of people singing, both male and female. If your servant comes there, I will only become a burden to my Lord Raja.
\v 36 I will accompany you across the Jordan river and walk a little to escort you away. That alone is special to me, and I need nothing more.
\v 37 Let me just go home, so that when I die I can be buried near the graves of my father and mother. It is better for my son, Kimham, to go to follow Tuan. Do for him what is best according to him."
\p
\v 38 David answered, "Very well! Kimham will cross and come with me to Jerusalem. There I will do for him what is good according to you. And if you need anything yourself, just say so. I definitely do."
\v 39 When he had finished crossing the river, David said goodbye, hugging Barzillai and wishing him a blessing. Then Barzilai returned to his city.
\p
\v 40 David walked to Gilgal with Kimham. The entire army of Judah and half of Israel's army accompanied the king.
\s1 Quarrel over the king
\p
\v 41 But an argument arose between the two parties. The army of Israel protested to the king, “Sir, this Judahite is going quietly to get the King and your company from the Jordan River! They didn't invite us!"
\p
\v 42 But the army of Judah answered them, “It is fitting that we do this, because the king is from our tribe! You don't have to be angry! We do this without pay, either gifts or food."
\p
\v 43 The children of Israel answered, “But our ten tribes have ten times more rights to King David than you who are of the tribe of Judah. You guys underestimated us! Aren't we the first to suggest raising King David again?!" But the people of Judah argued even more strongly.
