\s1 Absalom loses the battle and dies
\p
\v 1 David prepared for Absalom's attack. He gathered the troops that were with him and divided them into groups. Every one thousand people became a large group, which consisted of small groups of one hundred people. Each of these small groups was led by a commander.
\v 2 A third of his army was led by Joab, another third was led by Abishai, Joab's brother, and another third by Ittai the Gittite. Then David said to them, "I will also fight with you."
\p
\v 3 But many of his troops said, "No, sir! If we lose and run, even if we die, the enemy doesn't care because what they are looking for is the King himself. Your life is worth more than thousands\f + \fr 18:3 \fk thousands \ft The Hebrew text literally has 10,000. But that number is not meant to be an exact number, but is used frequently in the Bible with the meaning of 'very many'.\f* of soldiers. So you should just stay in the city and send help if we need help."
\p
\v 4-5 The king replied, "Very well, I will do as you suggest." David commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, "Do this for me: Do not be harsh with Absalom the young man." All the soldiers also heard the order. Then the king stood by the gate watching the whole army go by, lined up according to their respective groups.
\p
\v 6 The battle that day between David's army and the army of Israel, which Absalom led, took place in the forest of Ephraim.
\v 7 David's troops defeated the Israelite army. As many as twenty thousand soldiers died.
\v 8 The battle zone was expanding in the area, and more soldiers died in accidents in the forest than in the war.
\p
\v 9 Absalom was riding a mule\x + \xo 18:9 \xt 2 Sam. 13:29\x* in that battle. Suddenly he ran into some of David's soldiers. When the mule passed through the thick branches of a tree, Absalom's head was caught in the branches, while the mule kept running.
\v 10 One of David's soldiers saw what happened and reported it to Joab, "I saw Absalom hanging on a big tree."
\p
\v 11 Joab replied to the man, “What?! You saw him but didn't kill him! Too bad, if you would have killed him, I would have given you more than 100 grams of silver and an army badge of honor!”
\p
\v 12 But the man answered, "Even if the prize was ten kilograms of silver, I would not kill the king's son! For we have heard the king's orders to you, Abishai, and Ittai, "For my sake, don't be harsh to Absalom."
\v 13 If I had disobeyed his orders, the king would find out who did it, and you yourself would not have defended me!"
\p
\v 14 Joab said, "I don't want to waste time talking to you!" Then, while Absalom was still alive and caught in the big tree, Joab stabbed Absalom in the chest with three spears.
\v 15 So ten soldiers who were carrying Joab's armor surrounded Absalom and killed him.
\p
\v 16 Then Joab blew the trumpet to signal his troops to stop chasing the Israelite army.
\v 17 Absalom's body was thrown into a large hole in the forest, and large stones were piled on top of it until they were piled high. Meanwhile, the entire Israelite army ran home.
\p
\v 18 While Absalom was still alive, he had already made a monument to himself in the Valley of the Kings, because he thought, "I have no son who will carry on my name." So he named it the Monument of Absalom. The monument still existed when this book was written.
\s Absalom's death announced to David
\p
\v 19 After this incident, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, said to Joab, "Let me run to bring this good news to the king, that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies."
\p
\v 20 But Joab answered, “No! This would not be considered good news, because our master's son is dead. Next time you can bring news."
\p
\v 21 Then Joab said to an Ethiopian, “You are the one who is going! Tell the king what you have seen." The Ethiopian bowed down to honor Joab and then ran.
\p
\v 22 Ahimaaz said to Joab again, "Even though you have sent the Ethiopian, let me follow him."
\p Joab asked, "For what, son? You will not receive any reward for bringing the news."
\p
\v 23 But Ahimaaz answered, "Whatever happens, I just want to go."
\p So Joab said, "Yes, go." So Ahimaaz ran through the Jordan Valley, so that he came to Mahanaim before the Ethiopian.
\p
\v 24 At that time David was sitting at the city gate. A watchman stood guard in the fort above the gate. The watchman saw someone running to the city.
\v 25 He cried out to report the news to the king.
\p David said, "If he is alone, then he is a messenger." Meanwhile the messenger was getting closer.
\v 26 Then the watchman saw a second man coming, and he called out to the gatekeeper, "Look, there's one more coming."
\p The king said, "He is also a messenger."
\p
\v 27 The watchman said, "Seeing the way he is running, the first person seems to be Ahimaaz the son of Zadok."
\p The king replied, "He is a good person and will certainly bring good news."
\p
\v 28 Then Ahimaaz arrived. He bowed down to honor the king and said, “Praise the LORD God! He has defeated those who took up arms and rebelled against my Lord the King!"
\p
\v 29 David asked, "Is Absalom my son safe?" "Ahimaaz answered, "When Joab sent me here, I saw a great commotion, but I do not know what happened."
\p
\v 30 The king said, "Then wait over there." Then Ahimaaz stood at the place indicated by the king.
\p
\v 31 Then the Ethiopian arrived and went to the king. He said, “I bring good news to my Lord the King! The LORD has given just punishment to all those who agreed to rebel against you."
\p
\v 32 Then the king asked him, "Is my son safe?" The Ethiopian replied, "May all your enemies and all who have rebelled against you die like him."
\p
\v 33 The king was very shaken at the news. With great sorrow, he went up into the room above the gate, lamenting, "Oh, my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! Let me die in your place Absalom, my son, my son!"
