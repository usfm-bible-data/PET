\s David conquers the surrounding kingdoms
\p
\v 1 Some time later, David defeated the Philistines and made them submit to him. He took the city of Gath from their hands.\f + \fr 8:1 \fk tookâ€¦ \ft The Hebrew text in the second sentence is difficult to interpret. The word that TB translates as 'capital city' can also be interpreted as the name of the city of Meteg Amah. But a city by that name is unknown, while 1 Ch. 18:1 clearly gives the name of the city of Gath, and that is what is used in the TSI.\f*
\v 2 David also defeated the Moabites. At the end of the battle, he ordered all the surviving Moabites to lie down in a line on the ground. Then he used a piece of rope to measure their group. He measured two times the length of the rope as the group to be killed, and again measured a single length of the rope as the group to be left alive. So David subdued the Moabites so that they paid taxes to him.
\p
\v 3 David also defeated King Hadadezer, son of Rehob of Zobah.\f + \fr 8:3 \fk Zobah \ft In those days the kingdom of Zobah was a neighbor of the kingdom of Syria. Later the territory of Zobah became a part of the territory of the land of Syria.\f* This incident occurred when Hadadezer went to regain his authority in the area near the Euphrates river.
\v 4 In that battle David captured 1,700 charioteers\f + \fr 8:4 \fk charioteers \ft TSI translated this verse according to the Masoretic Text. The Septuagint says 1,000 chariots, 7,000 cavalry.\f* and 20,000 foot soldiers. David knocked out almost all of their horses. He left only a portion of them, which was enough to carry 100 wagons.
\p
\v 5 When the Syrian army came from the city of Damascus to help King Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 Syrian soldiers.
\v 6 Then David put guard posts in the land of Syria. So their land also became a colony of David's kingdom, and paid taxes to him. Wherever David went to war, the LORD always gave a victory.
\p
\v 7 David took the golden shields of Hadadezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
\v 8 He also took a great deal of bronze from Tebah\f + \fr 8:8 \fk Tebah \ft The Masoretic text has 'Betah' written. The TSI follows the Septuagint because the city must be the same as 'Tebah' in 1 Ch. 18:8.\f* and Berothai, cities belonging to Hadadezer.
\p
\v 9-10 King Hadadezer used to fight often against King Tou of the city of Hamath. So when King Tou heard that David had defeated all of Hadadezer's army, he sent his son, Joram, to convey their joy over David's victory. During this visit, Joram brought many gifts for David in the form of items of gold, silver, and bronze.
\p
\v 11 King David presented all the things from King Tou to the LORD. That is what he usually did with the gold and silver looted from any nation he had conquered,
\v 12 including the Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, Amalekites, as well as those from King Hadadezer.
\p
\v 13 Then the name David became even more famous in other lands after killing 18,000 soldiers from the Edomites in the Salt Valley.
\v 14 He had guard posts throughout the land of Edom, so that their country became his colony. The LORD always gave victory to David wherever he went to war.
\p
\v 15 David reigned over all Israel and everything he did was just and right for his people.
\s Officials in David's government
\li2
\v 16 Joab, son of Zeruiah, served as commander of the army.
\li2 Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, served as chief scribe recording royal decisions and events.
\li2
\v 17 Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, served as high priests.
\li2 Seraiah served as state treasurer.
\li2
\v 18 Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, served as commander of the king's guard.\f + \fr 8:18 \fk Cherethites and Pelethites \ft The Masoretic text has 'Cherithites and Pelethites'. The origin of the two groups is uncertain, but it is likely that they were mercenaries from other nations who were trained as the king's bodyguards.\f*
\li2 And the sons of David served as chief judges.\f + \fr 8:18 \fk chief judges \ft The word translated 'chief judges' is the word usually translated 'priests'. However, since David's sons could not become priests (because they were not descendants of Aaron), it is likely that the word 'priest' was used with another meaning, such as judge, minister, or advisor to the king.\f*
