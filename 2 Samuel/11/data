\s David and Bathsheba
\p
\v 1 In those days it was customary for kings to go to war in the spring. But one spring, King David sent Joab to bring the entire army of Israel to war. They destroyed the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. But David himself remained in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Then one evening, David just got up from his nap and was walking around on the roof of his palace.\f + \fr 11:2 \fk strolling on the roof ... \ft In David's time, the roof of the building took the shape of open terraces like fields, so people can sit around and relax on that roof.\f* From the roof he saw a very beautiful woman taking a bath.
\v 3 So David sent someone to find out about the woman. When the man returned, he said, "She is Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, wife of Uriah the Hittite."
\v 4 So David sent men to get the woman. Bathsheba came and David had sex with her. (At that time, Bathsheba had just finished cleaning herself after her menstrual period.) Then Bathsheba returned to her house.
\v 5 Some time later, Bathsheba realized that she was pregnant, so she sent a message to David, "I am pregnant."
\p
\v 6 Then David sent a message to Joab saying, "Call Uriah the Hittite, to come before me." So Joab sent Uriah to David.
\v 7 When Uriah came to David, David asked him about the condition of Joab and the army of Israel, and about the progress in the fighting that was going on.
\v 8 Then David said to Uriah, "Go back to your house and rest." Then Uriah left the palace, and a messenger of the king followed him to present a gift to him.
\v 9 But Uriah did not return home. He slept in front of the palace gate with the king's guards.
\p
\v 10 It was told David, "Uriah will not return to his house." Then David said to Uriah, “You just came back from a long service outside! Why don't you go back to your house?!”
\p
\v 11 Uriah replied to David, “The chest of covenant, the commander of Joab, and the armies of Israel and Judah were still camping in the open field. It is not appropriate for me to come home to eat, drink, and have sex with my wife. I swear before my Lord the King that I will not do that! ”
\p
\v 12 Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here another day. Tomorrow I will send you back. " So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem until the next day.
\v 13 So David invited Uriah again to eat and drink with him and made Uriah drunk. And that night Uriah did not return to his house, but slept on his mat with the king's guards.
\s1 David's plan to have Uriah die in battle
\p
\v 14 The next morning, David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
\v 15 In this letter David wrote: "Put Uriah at the forefront of the fiercest battle, and draw troops from him so that he is killed in the attack."
\v 16 So when Joab laid siege to the city, he put Uriah in a place where he knew there was a mighty enemy army.
\v 17 When the enemy's army came out of the city to attack and fight against Joab, several of David's soldiers were killed, including Uriah.
\p
\v 18 Then Joab sent men to give David a complete account of the battle.
\v 19 He ordered the messenger, "When you have finished giving the report of the battle to the king,
\v 20 maybe the king got angry and asked, 'Why are you so close to the city to fight? Don't you know that the enemy will shoot at you from the fortress of the city?
\v 21 Have you forgotten about Abimelek, son of Gideon,\f + \fr 11:21 \fk Gideon \ft The Hebrew text has Jerub Beset. Jerub Beset is another name for Jerub Baal. See Rights. 6:32. The word Beset or Boset means 'ashamed', and was used by the Israelites of that day as a derisive name for the idol Baal.\f* who died at Tebes? Didn't he die because a woman from the top of the tower dropped the top millstone on his head and crushed his skull?'\x + \xo 11:21 \xt Judg. 9:53\x* If my Lord the King asks that, tell him, 'The one who died was Uriah the Hittite.'"
\p
\v 22 So the messenger went to David and delivered all that Joab had commanded him.
\v 23 The messenger said to David, “When the enemies came out of the city gates, they started to beat us and managed to push us out of the city. But we managed to force them back to the city gate.
\v 24 The archers shot at your servants from the city fortress and some of the king's soldiers died, including the servant of my Lord Uriah the Hittite. "
\v 25 David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, 'Don't let this disappoint you, for it is impossible to predict who will die in the realm of battle. Continue to increase your attacks against that city and defeat them. "
\p
\v 26 When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned.
\v 27 When the period of grieving for her husband was over, David ordered that Bathsheba be brought to his palace. She became David's wife and bore him a son. But what David had done made the LORD angry.
