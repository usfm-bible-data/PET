\s News of the deaths of Saul and Jonathan delivered to David
\p
\v 1 After David chased and killed the Amalekites who had plundered Ziklag, he returned and stayed in Ziklag for two days without hearing news of Saul and the battle against the Philistine forces.
\v 2 On the third day a man came from the camp of Saul's army. He already tore his clothes and sprinkled dirt on his head as a sign of mourning. When he arrived before David, he bowed down to give respect.
\p
\v 3 Then David asked him, "Where are you from?"
\p He replied, "Your servant is from the Israelite army camp. I managed to escape the Philistine invasion there."
\p
\v 4 David asked him, “What happened in that battle? Tell me!"
\p The man replied, “The Israelite army fled the battle and many were killed. Even Saul and Jonathan died!"
\p
\v 5 David said to the man, "How do you know that Saul and his son are dead!"
\p
\v 6 The man answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa and saw Saul leaning on his spear, while the enemy's chariots and horsemen were approaching him.
\v 7 When Saul looked back, he saw me and called me. And I replied, 'Yes, my lord.'
\p
\v 8 Then he asked, 'Who are you?'
\q1 And I said, 'I'm an Amalekite.'
\p
\v 9 Then Saul said, 'Come here and kill me! I'm already dying, but have not died yet.'
\p
\v 10 So I killed him, because I knew that he would not survive in such a condition. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet on his arm, and brought it here to my Lord."
\p
\v 11 So David and all his followers tore their clothes as a sign of mourning.
\v 12 They mourned, wept, and fasted all day long over the death of Saul and Jonathan and the death of so many of the army of the LORD God of Israel.
\p
\v 13 Then David asked the messenger, "Where are you from?"
\p He answered, "Your servant is an Amalekite. My father is a foreigner who lives in the land of Israel."
\p
\v 14 David said to him again, "Why did you consider yourself worthy of killing the LORD's anointed?!"
\p
\v 15 Then David called one of his soldiers and said, "Kill him!" So the soldier killed the man.
\v 16 Before the man was killed, David said to him, "You are responsible for your own death, because you yourself confessed that you killed the LORD's anointed."
\s David's tribute to Saul and Jonathan
\p
\v 17-18 David lamented Saul and Jonathan by singing the mourning song which he entitled "Bow and Arrow." David also ordered that the song be taught to everyone in Judah. This song is written in the Book of Honest People.\f + \fr 1:18 Book ... \ft The word translated "Honest" can also be considered a person's name, which is "Jasher". This book is also mentioned in Josh. 10:12-13 and 1 Ki. 8:1-2.\f* These are the words of David's song:
\b
\q1
\v 19 O Israel, whose glory was slain in the hills!
\q2 How the mighty heroes have fallen!
\q1
\v 20 Do not tell the story in Gath,
\q2 do not tell it on the streets of Ashkelon,
\q1 lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,
\q2 and the idolaters cheer!
\b
\q1
\v 21 May rain or dew not fall on the mountains of Gilboa.
\q2 May the fields in that area not produce grain that can be offered to the LORD!
\q1 For there the shields of the heroes of Israel were defiled, and Saul's shield is no longer rubbed so that it shines.
\q1
\v 22 Saul's sword and Jonathan's arrow
\q2 never failed to kill enemies.
\q1 Their weapons of war were always covered in the blood and fat of the slain heroes.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Saul and Jonathan were very dear during their lifetime,
\q2 they were inseparable when alive even when they died.
\q2 They are faster than eagles, stronger than lions.
\q1
\v 24 Girls of Israel, lament Saul's death,
\q2 who has put the best and luxurious clothes on you,
\q2 who has decorated your clothes with gold.
\b
\q1
\v 25 How I mourn that our heroes have fallen
\q2 in the middle of a battle!
\q1 Jonathan was killed on the hills!
\q1
\v 26 I deeply grieve over you, my brother Jonathan!
\q2 I really love you.
\q1 The love of your friendship for me is more than that of a wife.
\b
\q1
\v 27 How the heroes of Israel have fallen!
\q2 Their weapons of war have been destroyed!
