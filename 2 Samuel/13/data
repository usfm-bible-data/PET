\s Amnon rapes Tamar
\p
\v 1 David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. Amnon, who was the son of David by another wife, fell in love with Tamar, his half sister.
\v 2 But Tamar was a virgin.\f + \fr 13.2 \fk virgin \ft The information 'virgin' shows that Tamar is a princess who must be guarded and protected strictly from any man who wants to meet her, including from her cousin.\f * So Amnon does not have the opportunity to be alone and sleep with Tamar. As a result of continuing to think about this, he became very restless and sick.
\p
\v 3 Amnon is best friends with his very clever cousin, his name is Jonadab. Jonadab was the son of Shimea, David's brother.
\v 4 Asked Jonadab to Amnon, "O son of the king, why do you always look gloomy every day? Tell me your problem."
\p Amnon answered him, "I am falling in love with Tamar, my half sister."
\p
\v 5 Jonadab answered Amnon, “Lie down on your bed and pretend you are sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, 'Let my sister Tamar come so she can prepare food for me. Let him prepare the food before my eyes, so that I can see, and let him feed me. "
\p
\v 6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Please allow my sister Tamar to come here to make bread before me, and I will eat from her hand."
\v 7 So David sent a message to Tamar, "Go to your brother Amnon's house and prepare food for him."
\p
\v 8 So Tamar brought bread dough to the house of Amnon her sister, who was lying in her room. In Amnon's presence, Tamar worked the dough and cooked some loaves in a frying pan.
\v 9 When all the bread was cooked and Tamar served it, Amnon refused to eat it. Amnon said to his male slaves, "Get all of you out of here!" Then they went out, and only Tamar remained with him.
\p
\v 10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the bread in my room and feed me." So Tamar did it.
\v 11 But when Tamar was at her side, Amnon pulled her up and said, "Brother, come sleep with me!"
\p
\v 12 Tamar said to her, “No, my brother! Don't force me to do such despicable things! This kind of crime cannot be committed in Israel!
\v 13 Think of me! This stain of sin will defile my name forever! And as a result you will also be insulted as the most ignorant person in Israel! Talk to the king. He will definitely allow you to marry me. "
\p
\v 14 But Amnon would not listen to Tamar. And because he was stronger than Tamar, he forced and raped her.
\v 15 Suddenly Amnon felt hatred towards Tamar, even the hatred was more than the previous feelings of love. Then he told Tamar, "Get up and get out of here!"
\p
\v 16 So Tamar answered, "No! Expelling me now is an even worse thing than you just did to me! " But Amnon wouldn't listen to him.
\v 17 He called his slave and said, "Get this woman out of here and lock the door!"
\p
\v 18-19 The slave did as he was told. Then Tamar sprinkled ashes on her head and tore off the long dress she was wearing. (In those days, all the king's daughters who were still virgins wore long dresses with beautiful patterns.) Tamar returned to her house, covering her face with her hands and crying bitterly.
\p
\v 20 When Absalom heard about this, he said to Tamar, “I heard what Amnon did to you. Calm down, my brother. She is your step sister. Don't think too much about this." Since that incident Tamar became very sad and isolated herself in the house of her brother Absalom.
\p
\v 21 When King David heard of this incident, he became very angry.
\v 22 After that Absalom never said anything to Amnon. But Absalom held a grudge against Amnon, because his sister had been raped.
\s Absalom kills Amnon
\p
\v 23 Two years later, when Absalom had a sheep-shearing party at Baal Hazor, near the border of the tribe of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to join him at the banquet.
\v 24 So Absalom went to the king and said, “Father, I am throwing a sheep-shearing party. I beg your father and officials to attend."
\p
\v 25 Then David answered, “No, my son. Let's not all go. We better not burden you like that. " Even though Absalom urged his father, David did not want to come along. David just said, "Have a nice party."
\p
\v 26 Then Absalom said, "If the king does not go, let my brother Amnon go with us."
\p The king replied, "Why ask him to come with you?"
\v 27 When Absalom pressed on, David finally allowed all of the boys to go with Absalom, including Amnon.
\p
\v 28 Absalom ordered his male servants, “Listen! When Amnon is drunk and I say, "Kill him," then you have to kill him. Do not be afraid! I give these orders and I will be responsible. Be strong and be brave!"
\v 29 So Absalom's servants did as they had been commanded. Seeing the murder, the other sons of the king climbed onto his mule.\f + \fr 13:29 \fk mule \ft The mule was the product of a cross between a horse and a donkey.\f* respectively and fled.
\p
\v 30 While they were still on their way, news reached David, “Absalom has killed all the king's sons! No one is saved!"
\v 31 Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and fell on the floor. All the officials also tore their clothes.
\p
\v 32 But Jonadab \x + \xo 13:32 \xt 2Sam. 13: 3 \x* said, “My lord, do not think that all your sons have been killed. Only Amnon was killed. Absalom had been planning this ever since Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
\v 33 My lord do not believe the news which says, "All the sons of the king were killed." Only Amnon died. "
\v 34 While things were still chaotic, Absalom fled.
\p In the city of Jerusalem a watchman saw large crowds coming down the mountain from the direction of Horonaim, and he reported this to the king.
\p
\v 35 Then Jonadab said, “My lord, look! Your children are coming, as I said!"
\p
\v 36 Just as Jonadab had finished speaking, all the king's sons arrived, weeping. The king and all his officials also wept very loudly.
\v 37 David mourned the death of Amnon for a long time.
\p Absalom fled to his grandfather the Talmai king, son of Ammihud, at Geshur.\x + \xo 13:37 \xt 2Sam. 3: 3\x*
\v 38 Absalom lived in Geshur for three years.
\v 39 When David was comforted by Amnon's death, he began to yearn to be with Absalom again.
