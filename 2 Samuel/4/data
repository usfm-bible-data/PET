\s Murder of Ishbosheth
\p
\v 1 When Ishbosheth heard that Abner had been killed in Hebron, he and all Israel were terrified.
\v 2 Ishbosheth has two team leaders who are tasked with plundering enemy territory. They were named Baanah and Recab, sons of Rimmon from the city of Beeroth, the Benjaminite. (Muscled in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 3 At a time when all the tribes of Israel were still taking up and occupying the dwellings according to Joshua's stipulations, the natives of Beeroth had already fled to Gitaim, and until the writing of this book were still living there as immigrants.)
\p
\v 4 (Jonathan had a five-year-old son, whose name was Mephibosheth. When the babysitter heard from Jezreel about the deaths of Saul and Jonathan, he took Mephibosheth away. But in his hurry, the child fell from his paralyzed.)
\p
\v 5 Recab and Baanah went to Ishbosheth's house at noon, while Ishbosheth was having his afternoon break.
\v 6-7 At that time the maid who was guarding the door of the house was cleaning the grain from the gravel. But that afternoon he was very sleepy, so he fell asleep there. So the two brothers entered the house without anyone knowing. Arriving at Ishbosheth's bedroom, they stabbed him in the stomach and cut off his head, then they fled. And carrying the head of Ish-bosheth, they passed the road leading to Araba all that night.\f + \fr 4: 6 \fk textual differences \ft Due to some problems with the Masoretic Text, like most other translations, the TSI follows the Septuagint. The Masoretic text in verse 6 can be translated, “They entered their house pretending to be carrying sacks of wheat. Then they stabbed Ishbosheth in the stomach, and fled. " Verses 6 and 7 are combined so that several events in verse 6 (according to the Septuagint) and verse 7 (in the Masoretic Text) do not repeat themselves.\f*
\v 8 Recab and Baanah brought Ishbosheth's head to David at Hebron, and said to him, “Behold! This is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of my Lord's enemy, Saul — who was trying to kill you! This day the LORD has avenged my Lord King against Saul and his descendants!”
\p
\v 9 But David answered them both, “I swear by the living Lord, who has saved my life from all dangers, that what I say is true:
\v 10 When someone came to Ziklag telling me that Saul was dead, even though he thought he had good news, I caught him and killed him. That's the reward I give for the news it brings!
\v 11 Especially when two bad guys kill an innocent man while he is sleeping in his own house! Surely I will take revenge for his life and cut you off the face of this earth! "
\p
\v 12 So David immediately ordered that Recab and Baanah be killed. Their hands and feet were cut off and their bodies hung by the pool in Hebron. Meanwhile, the head of Ishbosheth that the two men were carrying was buried in Abner's grave in Hebron.
