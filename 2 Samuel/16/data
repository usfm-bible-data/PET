\s1 King David and Ziba
\p
\v 1 Not long after David had passed the top of the hill, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, came. He met David with two saddled donkeys carrying two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred packets of raisins, one hundred packets of fresh fruit, and a wineskin.
\p
\v 2 The king asked Ziba, "What is all this for?" Ziba replied, "These donkeys are to be ridden by my Lord the King or your family. The bread and fruit are for my Lord's officials or servants, while the wine can refresh the body of one who is tired from traveling in the wilderness."
\p
\v 3 The king asked, "Where is Mephibosheth, grandson of your late master?"
\p He answered, "He remains in Jerusalem, because he said, 'Today the Israelites will appoint me to continue my grandfather's kingdom.'"
\p
\v 4 Then the king said to Ziba, "Then I will issue an order that all Mephibosheth's property become yours."
\p Ziba replied, "Thank you! Your servant is always ready to serve my Lord the King! May your servant always be pleasing in your eyes."
\s1 Shimei curses David
\p
\v 5 When King David arrived at the village of Bahurim,\f + \fr 16:5 \fk Bahurim \ft The village of Bahurum was located in the eastern part of Jerusalem, on the road leading to the Jordan Valley, and near the Mount of Olives.\f* Shimei appeared, son of Gera, who was a relative of Saul. Shimei cursed David
\v 6 while throwing stones at David, his servants, and officials. He did that even though the guards walked around the king.
\v 7 He cursed saying, “Go away! go away from here! Rude murderer, bastard!
\v 8 the LORD is repaying all your iniquities against the family of Saul, which you removed! Now the LORD has given Absalom the kingdom. Feel the consequences! You man of bloodshed!"
\p
\v 9 Then Abishai\x + \xo 16:9 \xt 2 Sam. 2:18 \x* said to the king, “My lord, do not let a despicable person like him swear at you. That dog doesn't deserve to curse the king. Let me chop off his head!"
\p
\v 10 But David rebuked him saying, “It's none of your business or your brother's! Let it go, because if it is the LORD's will, I will accept all of it."
\p
\v 11 David also said to Abishai and the rest of his party, “Do not be surprised by this Benjaminite. My own child wants to kill me, how much more this man!
\v 12 Hopefully, through this tribulation, the LORD will have mercy on me and give me a blessing in exchange for the curse I received today."
\v 13 So David and his party continued on their way, while Shimei followed from the higher place next to them, cursing and pelting David with stones and dirt.
\p
\v 14 Finally, with great exhaustion, the group arrived at the crossing at the Jordan River and rested there.
\s Hushai and Ahithophel come to Absalom
\p
\v 15 While David and his party were fleeing, Absalom, Ahithophel, and many of the Israelites supporting Absalom had already entered the city of Jerusalem.
\v 16 Hushai,\x + \xo 16:16 \xt 2 Sam. 15:32\x* the friend of David, greeted Absalom with the greeting, “Long live the king! Long live the king!"
\p
\v 17 Absalom answered, "Are you not faithful to your friend David? Why not go with him?"
\p
\v 18 Hushai said, "I only serve people who are chosen by the LORD and all the people of Israel. The one who becomes the king, he is my master.
\v 19 After all, it is very fitting for me to serve my Lord the King. I used to serve David, so now let me serve his son!"
\p
\v 20 Then Absalom asked Ahithophel, "What do you think I should do now?"
\p
\v 21 Ahithophel answered, "Now sleep with your father's concubines that he left to watch the palace. That way, all the Israelites will know that you have become an enemy of your father, so those who support you will be more confident."
\v 22 Then a tent was put up on the roof of the palace\x + \xo 16:22 \xt 2Sam. 11:2\x* for Absalom, so that all could see him when he entered the tent to sleep with his father's concubines.
\p
\v 23 At that time the advice given by Ahithophel was always right, as if  it were a message from God himself. Because of that David and Absalom always followed all his words.
