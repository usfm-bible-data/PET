\s The prophet Nathan rebukes King David
\p
\v 1 So the LORD sent the prophet Nathan to David. When Nathan met David, he said, “There were two men in a city. One was rich, while the other was poor.
\v 2 The rich man had many sheep and cows.
\v 3 But the poor man owned nothing but a lamb, which he bought when he was a child and was raised by him. The lamb grew up with his own children. The man often gave food and drink to the lamb from his own plate and cup. The lamb also slept on his master's lap, like his own daughter.
\v 4 "One day, the rich man had a visitor. But he didn't want to slaughter one from his flocks to feed his visitor. Instead, the rich man took the lamb of the poor man, then he slaughtered and cooked the lamb for his guest."
\p
\v 5 Hearing this, David became very angry with the rich man. He said to Nathan, “Before the living LORD, I say that anyone who does this deserves the death penalty!
\v 6 He must replace the sheep by giving four to the poor man.\x + \xo 12:6 \xt Ex. 22:1 \x* He stole and had no mercy on his neighbor."
\p
\v 7 Then Nathan said to David, "You are the rich man! This is what the LORD God of Israel says to you, 'I am the one who chose you to be king over Israel and saved you from Saul's hand.
\v 8 I have given you the palace of Saul and his wives. I have also made you king over Israel and Judah. If all that wasn't enough, I'm willing to give you so much more!
\v 9 Why did you break My commandments by doing evil before Me? You killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword of an Ammonite and took his wife as your wife!
\v 10 Since you have insulted me by taking Uriah's wife, then in every generation of your descendants there will be some killed by the sword!
\p
\v 11 I will bring calamity upon you which will come from your own family! I will take your wives and hand them over to someone close to you, and he will sleep with them in public during the day!
\v 12 You have sinned in secret, but I will avenge that crime openly before all Israel during the day.’"
\s1 David admits his mistake
\p
\v 13 Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD!" Nathan answered him, “Yes, but the LORD has forgiven your sins. You will not be put to death.
\v 14-15 However, because you have deeply insulted the LORD in this regard, your son who was born by the former wife of Uriah will die."
\p So when Nathan returned to his house, the LORD made the child very sick.
\v 16 Then David earnestly asked the LORD to heal his son. He came into his room and fasted and he lay all night on the floor.
\v 17 The high officials who were always in the palace invited him to get up from the floor and eat with them, but David refused.
\p
\v 18 Seven days later his son died. But his officials did not dare to tell him. They said to each other, “When that child was still alive and we invited him to eat, he wouldn't listen to us. Now if we tell him that his son is dead, he might just kill himself!"
\p
\v 19 When David saw his servants whispering to one another, he realized that his son was dead. He asked them, "Is my son dead?"
\p They answered, "Yes, my Lord the King, he is dead."
\p
\v 20 David got up from the floor, took a bath, put on perfumed oil, and changed his clothes. Then he worshiped the LORD in his tabernacle. After that he returned to the palace, and asked for food. Then he ate.
\p
\v 21 David's officials asked him, “Lord, we do not understand. Why when the child was still alive, My lord fasted and wept. But now that he is dead, my lord gets up and wants to eat!"
\p
\v 22 David answered, "When my son was still alive, I fasted and cried because I thought, 'Maybe the LORD will have mercy on me and let my son live.'
\v 23 But he is dead, why should I fast again? There's no way I can bring him back. Someday I will go to the place where he is, but now he will not come back to me again."
\p
\v 24-25 So David comforted Bathsheba. After David slept with her, Bathsheba became pregnant and gave birth to another son. David named the boy Solomon. And it turned out that the LORD loved this child, because the LORD sent a message through the prophet Nathan to name him Jedidiah.\f + \fr 12:24-25 \fk Solomon... \ft The name Solomon means "peace". Perhaps David considered the birth of a second child through Bathsheba to be a sign that he was reconciled with the LORD. The meaning of the name Jedidiah is 'loved by the LORD'.\f*
\s David's army defeats the Ammonites
\p
\v 26 Meanwhile, Joab was still fighting the inhabitants of Rabbah, which was the capital of the Ammonites. When taking control of the royal fortress,
\v 27 Joab sent a messenger to David with the message, “My troops have advanced to besiege the city of Rabbah and have succeeded in capturing the part of the fort which has a supply of water.
\v 28 It is better if my Lord the King gathers the remnant of Israel's army and then leads an attack to conquer this city, because it is better for this victory to be in the name of the King than in my name."
\p
\v 29 So David assembled all the troops that were still in Israel and went to Rabbah. Then they succeeded in capturing the city.
\v 30 David took the crown from the head of the king of the people of Rabbah. The crown was made of gold and decorated with gemstones. It weighed thirty four kilograms. As a sign of victory, the crown was placed on his head. David also took a great deal of loot from the city.
\v 31 David also enslaved the inhabitants of Rabbah and all the other cities in the land of Ammon. They were forced to work sawing wood, working in the mines with iron axes and pickaxes, and also working in brick making. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
