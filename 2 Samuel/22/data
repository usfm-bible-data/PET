\s Song of David
\p
\v 1 This is the song that David sang to praise the LORD after he was saved from the hand of Saul and from his other enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 2 â€œAs a strong fortress, You, O Lord, protect me from my enemies!
\q1
\v 3 O my God, You are like a rock where I can take refuge.
\q2 Better than a shield in battle, You protect and save me.
\q1 When my enemies threaten me with all kinds of cruel actions,
\q2 You, my Savior, are like a place in the wilderness to which I can flee and take refuge.
\b
\q1
\v 4 O Lord, You are worthy of praise!
\q2 When I cried out to You, You saved me from my enemies.
\q1
\v 5-6 When I feel like I'm about to drown in the waves of the sea,
\q2 feel like caught and bound to be thrown into a grave,
\q2
\v 7 I cry out to You, O LORD!
\q1 Yes, out of great distress, when I cry out to You, O my God,
\q2 from Thy house You heard me.
\q1 In such circumstances, you still hear my prayer for help.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Then your anger is aroused,
\q2 so that an earthquake occurs,
\q2 and the foundations of the heavens shook and trembled.
\q2
\v 9 A puff of smoke comes out of Your nose, and a torrent of hot coals comes out of Your mouth.\f + \fr 2: 9-16 \fk nose ... mouth \ft God is spirit, although in some places in the Bible He shows self to humans with a form like having a physical body. It should be noted that in verses 8-15, David wrote in poetic figurative language. It is better not to assume that David saw God create the things that are described in these verses. Actually David used dramatic language to describe what he felt when suddenly he was saved by God with extraordinary power.\f*
\q1
\v 10 You opened the heavens to save me and stepped down,
\q2 trample the dark clouds.
\q1
\v 11 How swiftly thou hast come, as if carried on the wings of a guardian angel,
\q2 is faster than birds.
\q1
\v 12 You have clothed Yourself with darkness,
\q2 and was not visible when it came because it was surrounded by thick clouds.
\q1
\v 13 Then there were flashes of lightning all around you
\q2 which ignites the coals of fire on the earth.
\q1
\v 14 And your voice echoed
\q2 like thunder from the sky.
\q1
\v 15 Like a skilled archer, You shoot lightning
\q2 to my enemies, and they ran scattered.
\q1
\v 16 To save me from drowning in the profound sea,
\q2 You breathed Your breath until the strong winds swept away the sea waters,
\q2 and the shape of the seabed and the earth's floor is visible.
\q1
\v 17 Then from heaven You stretched out Your hand
\q2 and lift me out of the dangers of that sea.
\q1
\v 18 Thank you, O Lord, because you see that my enemies are too strong for me,
\q2 then You saved me from all those who hate me.
\q1
\v 19 They attacked me when I was weak and troubled,
\q2 but You are the one who supports me.
\q1
\v 20 Then You took me out to a safe place,
\q2 because I am after Your eyes.
\b
\q1
\v 21 O Lord, you have saved me, because I live right with you.
\q2 I am so blessed to be innocent,
\q2
\v 22 and for keeping your commandments.
\q2 I did not leave You to do evil.
\q1
\v 23 I continue to observe all Your regulations,
\q2 and do not violate Your statutes.
\q1
\v 24 You know that I really take care of myself
\q2 so as not to be blamed for sin.
\q1
\v 25 Therefore, You, O Lord, bless me
\q2 because You see me living with a sincere heart before You.
\b
\q1
\v 26 You are faithful to those who are faithful to You.
\q2 You are kind to those who are good.
\q1
\v 27 You show your sincerity to those who are sincere.
\q2 But You reward those who deceive according to their deeds!
\q1
\v 28 You save the humble.
\q2 But an arrogant person You will humble at the right time.
\b
\q1
\v 29 O Lord, You are like a lamp
\q2 which illuminates me when I am in the dark.
\q1
\v 30 With Your help, I can face the enemy hordes.
\q2 When You, O my God, strengthen me, I can jump over the city fortresses of my enemies!\f + \fr 22:30 \fk leap ... \ft In this line David uses a hyperbolic style of speech, that is, he exaggerates his strength. He did not become super strong, but because of God's help, he felt very empowered to defeat his enemies.\f*
\b
\q1
\v 31 Everything You do is perfect,
\q2 and your every word is proven true.
\q1 You are like a shield for all who take refuge in You.
\q1
\v 32 For there is no god like you, O LORD.
\q2 Only you, O God of Israel, are like a rock for your people.
\q1
\v 33 Yes, You are a strong Protector for me.
\q2 You keep my life safe.
\q1
\v 34 And you gave me abilities like a deer,
\q2 so that I can run on the big mountain without tripping.
\q1
\v 35 You have trained my body for war,
\q2 until my hands get strong to aim a heavy bow.
\b
\q1
\v 36 I can win in battle only because You protect me.
\q2 I got a high position only because You bent down to lift me up.
\q1
\v 37 I did not stumble and fall
\q2 because You have paved the way for me.
\b
\q1
\v 38 I have chased and slaughtered all my enemies.
\q2 I didn't stop chasing them before they were all destroyed.
\q1
\v 39 I destroy and consume them.
\q2 They were lying at my feet and could not get up.
\q1
\v 40 You have equipped me with the strength to fight,
\q2 You will bring my enemies to their knees under my feet.
\q1
\v 41 You are the one who makes my enemies turn and flee,
\q2 so that I can get rid of all who hate me.
\q1
\v 42 They cried out for help to their gods,
\q2 but nothing saved them.
\q1 They even cry out to you, O Lord,
\q2 but You did not answer them.
\q1
\v 43 I beat them to pieces like dirt,
\q2 and I trample them like mud on the road.
\b
\q1
\v 44 You have saved me from the resistance of my own people,
\q1 and made me ruler over the nations.
\q2 People I don't know serve me.
\q2
\v 45 Just now they heard of my brush,
\q2 they immediately fell to my knees.
\q2 46 Trembling, they went out of their fortress city and gave themselves up as my slaves.
\b
\q1
\v 47 O Lord, You live!
\q1 Praised be You who are like a rock to me!
\q2 May You, my Protector and Savior, be always exalted.
\q1
\v 48 You are the God who always repays those who do evil to me,
\q2 and it was You who made the nations submit to me.
\q1
\v 49 Because of Your faithfulness alone, I have been saved from my enemies,
\q1 and was given victory over those who wanted to abuse me.
\q1
\v 50 Therefore, before the nations, I will give thanks to you, O LORD!
\q2 I will always sing praises to You!
\q1
\v 51 Oh, thank you, Lord, because You gave a great victory to Your chosen king,
\q2 and continue to show Your love and loyalty to me and my ancestry forever!"
