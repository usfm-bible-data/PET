\p
\v 1 This battle was the beginning of a long war between the supporters of the kingdom of Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and David's supporters. The longer the supporters of David grew stronger, but the supporters of Saul's kingdom grew weaker.
\s Sons of David
\p
\v 2-5 While David was in Hebron, his wives bore him six sons. Here are their names in order of birth:
\b
\li1 Ahinoam, the Jezreelite gave birth to Amnon,
\li1 Abigail, the Carmelite widow of Nabal, gave birth to Chile,
\li1 Makah, the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur gave birth to Absalom,
\li1 Hagit gave birth to Adonia,
\li1 Abital gave birth to Sefatya,
\li1 Egla gave birth to Yitream.

\s Abner defects to David
\p
\v 6 As the war between the supporters of the kingdom of Ishbosheth, son of Saul, and the supporters of David continued, Abner grew increasingly influenced by the supporters of the Saul family.
\v 7 One day Ishbosheth accused Abner of having slept with one of Saul's concubines, Rizpah, Aya's son. Ishbosheth said to Abner, "You have committed a crime by screwing my father's wife!"
\p
\v 8 Then Abner replied very angrily, “Do you think I am a dog from Judah?! To this day I have been loyal to your father's family and supporters, though I could easily leave you in David's hands. But today you accuse me of committing a grave offense, even though it's just a trivial affair with women!\f + \fr 3: 8 \fk squabbling situation \ft One of the things that makes this verse difficult to understand for today's readers is the fact that the way of life of those who lead Israel is far from the will of God, so that something like this can happen. Apart from the law of God which says "You must not commit adultery," there was a command from Moses that a king of Israel should not have many wives. (Deut. 17:17) In King Ishbosheth's view, Abner's act of sleeping with his father's mistress was seen as a threat. Ishbosheth must be thinking, "If Abner screwed the mistress who is now mine, that means he also wants to replace me as king!" Abner must have understood how Ishbosheth responded to his actions, but he didn't want to admit that he had any other goal than just wanting to have sex with women. Besides that, Abner's offense was also caused because he felt that he was more powerful in the kingdom of Ishbosheth, even more than the king himself. This was seen when he threatened Ishbosheth in verses 9-10, and Ishbosheth did not dare to retaliate.\f*
\v 9 Let God punish me, even take my life if I do not help fulfill God's promise to David!
\v 10 I will hand over the kingdom of your father to him and strengthen his kingdom over all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba! "
\v 11 Ishbosheth could not answer Abner a single word because she was afraid of him.
\p
\v 12 Then Abner sent a messenger to David to say, “Let us decide who will be king over all this land! Make a pact with me, and I will make all Israel support you. "
\p
\v 13 So said David, "Fine. I will make a deal with you. But before we can negotiate, I demand that you return my wife, Michal, Saul's son. "
\p
\v 14 Then David sent a messenger to Ishbosheth, "Give me back my wife Michal, whom I had obtained with the dowry of one hundred Philistine foreskin."
\p
\v 15 So Ishbosheth ordered that Michal be taken from her husband Paltiel, the son of Lais.
\v 16 When Abner and some of his soldiers brought Michal to David, Paltiel followed them from behind, weeping all the way from Mahanaim to Bahurim. Finally Abner said to her, "Go home!" So Paltiel went home.
\p
\v 17 Then Abner advised the leaders of Israel, “You have been disappointed with Ishbosheth for a long time and want David to be our king.
\v 18 Now is the time for us to act! Because the LORD had said to David, 'By the hand of my servant David, I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from all their enemies.'
\v 19 Abner also spoke specifically with the leaders of the tribe of Benjamin. So Abner went to Hebron to tell David what all Israel and all the tribe of Benjamin had agreed to.
\p
\v 20 When Abner and twenty soldiers came to meet David at Hebron, David prepared a banquet for them.
\v 21 Abner said to David, “Lord King, let me go home to gather all Israel, so that they can make a deal with you. You will rule over everything you want." So David let Abner go, and he came home safely.
\s Joab kills Abner
\p
\v 22 Shortly after Abner left Hebron safely, Joab and David's soldiers returned from an ambush with a lot of loot.
\v 23 When they arrived, someone said to him: “Abner, son of Ner, came to see the king, and the king let him go safely!”
\p
\v 24 So Joab went to the king and rebuked him, "My lord King, what have you done?! Abner has come to you! Why did my master let him go?!
\v 25 You know that Abner cannot be trusted! Surely he came to deceive the King and spy on everything you do! "
\p
\v 26 So Joab left David and sent a messenger to Abner. They met Abner at Sira's well and asked him to return. But David did not know this at all.
\v 27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab led him to the edge of the gate, as if to speak with him in private. Then Joab stabbed Abner in the stomach with his knife so that he died — in revenge for the death of his younger brother Asahel.
\p
\v 28 When David heard about this incident, he said, “Before the Lord, for all eternity, I and my kingdom are not guilty of Abner's death.
\v 29 Let Joab and all his family members avenge him! Let there always be males among the descendants of Joab who were unclean, because they had wounds that kept oozing out. Or let the descendants of Joab catch a dangerous skin disease, or be lame, or be killed in war or famine!"
\p
\v 30 So Joab and his younger brother, named Abishai, killed Abner, because they had killed their younger brother named Asahel in the battle of Gibeon.
\b
\p
\v 31 David told Joab and all the people in Hebron, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth. Wail for Abner!” And King David walked behind the bier.
\v 32 They buried Abner's body in Hebron. David wept very loudly at Abner's grave, and all the people wept too.
\v 33 The king sang a lament to Abner:
\b
\q1 “Should Abner die like a fool?
\q1
\v 34 Your hands are not tied
\q2 and your feet are not shackled.
\q1 Too bad,
\q2 the bad guys are killing you, Abner! "
\b
\p After long enough mourning Abner with all the people,
\v 35 when he came home that afternoon, someone urged David to eat. But David swore, "Let God punish me, even take my life, if I taste bread or anything before sunset!"
\p
\v 36 All the people paid attention to what David was doing, and they regarded it well. In fact, everything the king did they looked up to.
\v 37 And that day all the people and all Israel realized that Abner's murder was not at David's order.
\p
\v 38 Then David said to his servants, “Realize that today Israel has lost a great leader!
\v 39 Today I feel weak, even though I have been installed as king. I cannot control the violence of the two sons of Zeruiah, namely Joab and Abishai! Let the LORD justly punish them for their crimes! ”
