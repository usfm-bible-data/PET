\c 9
\s David shows his love for Mephibosheth
\p
\v 1 One day David asked his employees, “Are there any members of Saul's family who are still alive? I want to show love and loyalty to him because of my promise to Jonathan. "
\v 2 So Ziba called a former slave of the Saul family. When he came, the king asked him, "Are you Ziba?"
\p He answered, "Yes, my Lord the King, your servant is named Ziba."
\p
\v 3 David asked, “Are there any members of Saul's family who are still alive? I wanted to show him God's love and loyalty. " Ziba said, "There is one son of Jonathan who is still alive, but his legs are paralyzed."
\p
\v 4 The king asked Ziba, "Where is he?"
\p Ziba replied, "He lives at the house of Makir's son Amiel, in Lo Debar."
\p
\v 5 So King David ordered to fetch him from Makir's house.
\v 6 When Jonathan's son Mephibosheth came, he bowed down to honor David. And David asked, "Are you Mephibosheth?"
\p He answered, "Yes, my lord King."
\p
\v 7 David said to him, “Do not be afraid, for I will certainly show love and loyalty to you because of my promise to your father, Jonathan. I will return your grandfather's land, Saul, and you will always be allowed to eat at my table. "
\p
\v 8 Then Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “Lord King, I am not a person who deserves such honor! I am just a useless lowly person. "
\p
\v 9 Then the king called Ziba again and said to him, “I have decided to give everything that Saul and his family had to Mephibosheth, the grandson of your master.
\v 10 You, your children, and your slaves must work the land and harvest its produce, so that there will be food for the family of Mephibosheth. But Mephiboseth itself will still be my guest and eat at the table with me. " (Ziba had fifteen sons, and twenty slaves.)
\p
\v 11 Then Ziba said to the king, "I will do as my Lord King has commanded me." So after that Mephibosheth usually ate at the table with David, just like one of the king's own sons.
\p
\v 12 Mephiboseth had a young son named Mika. All the members of the Ziba family became Mephibosheth's slaves,
\v 13 whose legs were paralyzed. So Mephibosheth remained in Jerusalem, because he was a regular guest in the king's palace.
