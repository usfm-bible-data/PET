\s David conducts a population census of Israel\x + \xo 24: 1 \xt 1 Ch. 21\x*
\p
\v 1 One day, the LORD was angry with the people of Israel. So to punish them, He caused an impulse in David's heart.\f + \fr 24: 1 \fk caused ... \ft In 1Ch. 21: 1 it is written that 'opponent / enemy' or 'Satanas' persuaded David to do the same thing (The name Satanas means 'opponent' or 'enemy'.) If you choose the interpretation that Satanas seduced David, then that is not contradicting this verse , considering Job 1-2. It turns out that counting the number of the Israelites without being ordered by God Himself violates the principles contained in Gen. 22:17. In that verse the LORD swore to Abraham to give him offspring so many that they could not be counted, "as the number of the stars in the sky and the sand by the sea."\f* saying, "Count the number of Israel and Judah."
\p
\v 2 Then David told Joab, the commander of the army of Israel, "Go through the land of Israel from the north to the south, to count adult males, so that I will know the number of men who are capable of fighting."
\p
\v 3 Joab replied to the king, "Sir, may in the life of my Lord the Lord God multiply the number of the people of Israel to a hundred times, and you still have time to see it! Let my Lord the King not take this census."
\p
\v 4 However, the king insisted that his orders must be carried out. So Joab and the commanders under him went to take the census.
\v 5 They crossed the Jordan River and camped south of the city of Aroer, which is in the middle of the valley that is in the region of the tribe of Gad. Counting all the males in the area, they continued north as far as the city of Jazer.
\v 6 They then moved north again, to the area of Gilead and the town of Tahtim Hodosi. Then they crossed the Jordan again and counted the people in the far north of Israel starting from the city of Dan Jaaanan and continuing south as far as the city of Sidon.
\v 7 From there they continued south to the region of the city of Tire. (The city was surrounded by a fort.) Then they explored all the areas that were formerly owned by the Hivites and the Canaanites, and they continued south, to the wilderness in the southern region of the tribe of Judah and the city of Beersheba in the far south.
\p
\v 8 The journey through the whole of Israel took nine months and twenty days, and the army that carried it out returned to Jerusalem.
\v 9 Joab reported the results of his census to the king. The number of men capable of fighting is 800,000 from the tribes of Israel other than Judah, and 500,000 from the tribe of Judah alone.

\s1 Penalties for taking a census
\p
\v 10 But after the census was finished, David felt guilty and he prayed to the LORD, “I have sinned so much for doing this! O Lord, please forgive your servant who has acted so foolishly."
\p
\v 11 The next morning before David got up, the LORD had delivered the answer to David's prayer to the prophet Gad. Gad served as the prophet who reported to the king.
\v 12 The LORD said to Gad, "Tell David, 'This is what the LORD says: I will give Israel three choices of punishment because of the census you have carried out. Choose one, and I'll do it.'"
\p
\v 13 Then, Gad delivered the message of the LORD to David, he said, "The Lord gave these three choices: First, famine throughout Israel for three years.\f + \fr 24:13 \fk three years \ft Even though the Masoretic Text have 'seven years' here, the Septuagint and Masoretic Text in 1 Ch. 21:12 has "three years."\f* Second, the Israelites were defeated by their enemies for three months, so that the Israeli army was forced to flee. Or the third option, a plague that swept all of Israel for three days. Let the King think carefully. Then I will convey your choice to the Lord."
\p
\v 14 David answered, "Ouch! Woe is me! But it is better for us to receive punishment directly from the hand of the LORD than through men, because He is full of mercy."
\p
\v 15-16 So, starting that morning the LORD sent an angel of death, who brought disease to the Israelites for three days. Seventy thousand people died in all parts of Israel, from the far north to the south. But when the angel of death came to Jerusalem, and when he reached out to kill its inhabitants, the LORD had mercy on the people who were suffering because of His punishment. So He said to the angel, “Enough! Lower your hands now!” At that time, the angel was at the threshing floor belonging to Arauna, the Jebusite.
\v 17 When David saw the angel of death, he prayed, “Lord, I am the one who has sinned and made a mistake, not my people. They are like sheep I must protect. Let me and my family bear the punishment of the LORD."
\s David builds the altar
\p
\v 18 Here are the details of the cessation event that punishment. On that day, Gad came to David and said, "Build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Arauna."
\p
\v 19 So David went to do as the LORD commanded.
\v 20 When Arauna saw the king and his servants coming, he went out to greet them and bowed down to honor the king.
\v 21 Arauna asked, "What is the need for my lord to come to the place of your servant?" David answered, “I want to buy your threshing floor to build an altar to the Lord. I will offer sacrifices to ask Him to stop this plague."
\p
\v 22 Then Arauna said to David, "Please my lord king take everything that you need to make an offering to the LORD! I surrender everything, including a pair of cows for a burnt offering, and all this threshing wood can be used as firewood.\f + \fr 24:22 \fk a pair of cows ... \ft In the Hebrew text only the word 'cow' can be considered plural or singular. But usually a pair of cows is employed to pull the load. (A pair of cows that is employed can be a female, but more often a castrated bull.) The two cows are yoked on the shoulders, and the weight drawn is the threshing device. In Hebrew Arauna invites David to use both the cow yoke and the threshing machine as firewood.\f*
\v 23 I give all this to my lord Raja. May the LORD God be pleased with your offering!"
\p
\v 24 But David said, “Don't be like that! I have to buy it. It is not right for me to sacrifice an animal that I receive freely to the Lord my God!” So David bought the threshing floor and a pair of cows for six hundred grams of silver.
\p
\v 25 David built an altar to the Lord there and offered many burnt offerings and peace offerings. And God answered David's prayer to stop the plague that attacked the Israelites.
