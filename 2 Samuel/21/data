\s The people of Gibeon demand justice
\p
\v 1 During the reign of David, there were famines for three consecutive years. Then David prayed for the Lord's direction, and the LORD answered, "This is because Saul has broken the oath of the Israelites to the Gibeonites.\x + \xo 21: 1 \xt Josh. 9\x* Saul killed the Gibeonites, so his sons are still responsible for the shedding of the Gibeonites' blood.
\p
\v 2 The Gibeonites were not descended from Israel, but descended from the Amorites. In Joshua's day the Israelites had sworn not to destroy the inhabitants of the city of Gibeon. But because King Saul wanted the Israelites and Judah not to mix with them, he tried to finish them all off.
\p Therefore, King David summoned the surviving Gibeonites to discuss this matter with them.
\v 3 He asked, "With what we can repay the blood owed to you, so that the Lord will again bless His people?"
\p
\v 4 They answered, “We don't want to be paid with Saul's or his family's assets. Nor do we have the right to demand the death penalty for any of the Israelites."
\p Ask David, "Then what can I do to make you feel like this problem has been resolved?"
\p
\v 5 They answered, “The one who tried to destroy us so that we might be extinct from the land of Israel was Saul.
\v 6 To repay this deed, hand over to us seven males from the seed of Saul. We will hang them before the LORD at his place of worship which is on the hill of Gibeah,\f + \fr 21: 6 \fk Gibeah \ft TSI follows the Masoretic Text in the spelling of the name Gibeah, which is also mentioned in 1Sam. 10: 5. While there is another translation that spells Gibeon, which is indeed the hometown of the Gibeonites. It turns out that Gibeah and Gibeon are close together. Based on what happened in verse 10, the deserted hill is more suitable for this incident.\f* where Saul often camped."
\p Then King David said, "All right, I will hand them over to you."
\v 7 But the king protected Jonathan son of Mephibosheth, because of the oath of friendship between David and Jonathan before the Lord.
\p
\v 8-9 The seven sons of Saul's descendants whom David handed over to the Gibeonites were Armoni and the other Mephibosheth — two sons of Saul by his concubine Rizpah, and five of Saul's grandchildren by his daughter Merab. (Rizpah is Aya's son. Merab's husband is Adriel, son of Barzillai from the town of Mehola.) The seven men were hanged on the same day at the start of the barley harvest season. The death sentence was carried out at the Lord's place of worship on the hill of Gibeah.
\p
\v 10 Then Rizpah took the sackcloth and spread it on the large rock near the place where his two sons and five other members of the family were hanged. He stayed there guarding the corpses from being eaten by birds by day or by wild animals by night. He continued to look after it for nearly two months, from the start of the harvest season to the rain that marked the end of the harvest season.
\p
\v 11 David received a report about what Rizpah was doing.
\v 12-13 Therefore, David sent some of his officers to gather the bones of the seven men. They were also ordered to take the bones of Saul and Jonathan from the inhabitants of the city of Jabez. (Long ago, after Saul and Jonathan died at Gilboa, the Philistines hung their corpses on the wall of the town square of Bet Shan. But the people of Jabesh stole the bodies and buried them in their city.)\x + \xo 21:12-13 \xt 1 Sam. 31:8-13; 2 Sam. 2:4-7\x*
\v 14 Then according to David's orders, the officers buried all the bones in the burial place of Kish the father of Saul, in the city of Zela in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. After that event God granted the petition of the Israelites to bless their crops.
\s The Israelites fought against the Philistine giants
\p
\v 15 One day the Israelites returned to war with the Philistines. David and his soldiers fought the Philistine forces until David was exhausted.
\v 16 So Isbi Benob, one of the descendants of the giants, wanted to take this opportunity to kill David. Isbi's armor was a new sword and spear that weighed three and a half kilograms.
\v 17 But Abishai\x + \xo 21:17 \xt 2Sam. 2:13, 18\x* came to David's aid and killed the Philistine giant. Then the soldiers said to David, “Lord is the hope of Israel! Please don't join us in battle anymore. We do not want to lose sir!"
\p
\v 18 Some time later, there was another battle with the Philistines in the village of Gob. At that time, Israeli soldiers named Sibekai, the Husa people, killed Saf, one of the giants' descendants.
\p
\v 19 After this, there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob. This time, Elhanan, son of Jair from the city of Bethlehem, killed Goliath's brother, the Gittite, whose spear was heavy like a weaver's beam.
\p
\v 20 Then there was another battle with the Philistines at Gath. One of the Philistine heroes was a descendant of giants who were enormous and had six fingers on each hand and foot. The total is twenty-four!
\v 21 But when the giant mocked the Israelites, Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shimei, killed him.
\p
\v 22 So, there were four descendants of the giants from the city of Gath who were killed by David and his troops.
