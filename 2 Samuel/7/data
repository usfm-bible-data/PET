\s The LORD makes a covenant with David
\p
\v 1 When King David settled in his palace peacefully, and after the LORD had put an end to the disturbance of all the enemies around him,
\v 2 David said to the prophet Nathan, “Behold! I live in a palace made of cedar wood, while the LORD's covenant chest is still in the tent. This is inappropriate. "
\p
\v 3 Nathan answered, "Sir, do it according to the will of your heart, for the LORD is with you."
\p
\v 4 But that very night the LORD said to Nathan,
\pi
\v 5 "Go, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says: You are not the one who is fit to build a house for me.
\v 6 Since I brought the Israelites out of Egypt to this day, I have never lived in a house. On the other hand, I was always moving around with them and staying in the tent.
\v 7 Wherever I move with the Israelites, I never order anyone whom I choose to lead Israel to build for Me a house of cedar. '
\pi
\v 8 "Therefore, say to my servant David, 'This is a message from the LORD Almighty: I am the one who raised you from the pasture, from your work as a shepherd, and made you the leader of my people Israel.
\v 9 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and with your own eyes you have seen Me defeat all your enemies. Now I will make you famous like the greatest people on earth.
\v 10 I will prepare a land for my people Israel so that they can live there without being disturbed again. The wicked will not oppress them anymore, as it used to be
\v 11 since I appointed judges to lead my people Israel.
\pi “'You will be safe from all your enemies. I also declare to you that you will not build a house for Me, but I myself will build a palace for you! I mean, I will make your children and grandchildren lead as kings from generation to generation.\f + \fr 7:11 \fk it is not you who will build ... \ft in this verse the LORD uses a style of language called 'play on words' (play word). God uses the word 'house' with two meanings. First in verse 5, "house" denotes the house of the LORD, which David was going to build physically. But in this verse, God says that He will build a "house" for David. The word 'house' is used by God figuratively to mean the dynasty of the Davidic kings. In the translation of this verse, the TSI repeats a bit of information from verse 5 and translates it with the word 'palace', so that this style of language is felt to the reader. The figures for 'house' or 'palace' are also found in verses 16, 25, 26, 27, and 29, where the TSI translates according to the meaning of 'descendant'.\f*
\v 12 When your end comes and I place you together with your ancestors who have passed away, I will make your biological son as your substitute, and I will strengthen his kingdom.
\v 13 It is he who will build a house to my glory,\f + \fr 7:13 \fk my glory \ft The Hebrew text literally says 'for my name'. It is a figure of speech where "My name" represents the entire existence of God. A metaphor like this is also found in verse 25.\f* and I will establish his rule forever and ever.
\v 14 I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he sins, I will beat him as a father teaches his son a lesson.
\v 15 But I will not stop loving her faithfully. So I will not repeat what I did to Saul, whom I removed from your presence.
\v 16 The kingdom of your descendants will continue to rule forever before Me, and your kingdom will be eternal. ""
\p
\v 17 Nathan returned to David and said all the things that the LORD had revealed to him.
\s David's prayer to the LORD
\p
\v 18 Then King David entered the courtyard of the new tabernacle and sat down before the LORD and said, "O LORD my God, Your servant is nothing, my family is just an ordinary person. But you took me this far.
\v 19 And You did not stop there, O LORD!\f + \fr 7:19 \fk You did not stop ... \ft The Hebrew text can be translated more literally as, "And it is only a trifle to You, LORD . "\f* You have even spoken about the future of Your servant's family. Of course You don't treat every human like this, O LORD!
\pi
\v 20 “So there is nothing more that Your servant can ask of You! Because you know all of my heart, O LORD!
\v 21 According to Your promise and Your own will, You have planned such great things for me, and now tell me.
\pi
\v 22 “How great are You, O LORD! There is no one like You! From the testimony of our ancestors, even from the words of god-worshipers, we know that no god can compare to You!
\v 23 There is also no other nation on earth who is like Your people Israel. There is no other nation, O God, whom You redeemed from slavery so that they may be Your own. By redeeming Your people from Egypt, You will exalt Your name in the eyes of all other nations. You did great miracles and drove the nations and their gods out of your people.
\v 24 You have made Israel your nation forever. And thus thou, O LORD, became their God.
\pi
\v 25 “So now, O LORD God, let your promise about your servant and the offspring of your servant be true forever. Carry out according to Your promise,
\v 26 and in this way may You be glorified forever, and let all people confess, 'The LORD Almighty, He is the God who leads Israel!' And let the kingdom of the descendants of Thy servants always be strong before You.
\pi
\v 27 "O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, it is you who told Your servants, 'I myself will build a palace for you!' Thus, You have promised that the descendants of Your servants will rule from generation to generation as kings. 'That is why I have the courage to say this prayer.
\v 28 O LORD Ruler, You are the true God! All Your words can be trusted. And You have promised very good things for Your servant!
\v 29 May you bless the offspring of my servants, so that they always live and serve You. For I know, when You yourself bless this family of Your servants, that blessing will last forever! "
