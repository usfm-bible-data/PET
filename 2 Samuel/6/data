\s The ark of the covenant is taken to Jerusalem
\p
\v 1-2 A few years later David decided to remove the Lord's ark of the covenant from the city of Kiriath Jearim\f + \fr 6: 1-2 \fk Kiriath Jearim \ft The Hebrew text lists another name for Kiriath Jearim, namely Baale Yehuda. TSI uses a name that is more familiar to readers, and is found on 1Sam. 6:21; 7: 1-2.\f* to Jerusalem. He wanted the center of worship to the Most High God, the God who reigned over the two forms of guardian angels on the lid of the chest, to stay in the City of David. For the event he gathered 30,000 selected soldiers from across the Israeli army, and went with them to Kiriath Jearim to remove the covenant chest.
\v 3-4 They loaded the covenant box on a new wagon and brought it from Abinadab's house, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, both sons of Abinadab, directed the cart, which was pulled by two cows.\f + \fr 6: 3 \fk two cows \ft The information about the cow pulling the cart is taken from verse 6. In verse 6, the word ‘cow’ in Hebrew is less clear if it is plural or singular. TSI calls two cows because a pair of cows is often used to pull a load.\f* Ahio walks in front of the covenant chest.
\v 5 David and all the people of Israel rejoiced before the Lord by dancing, singing, and playing the harp, lute, tambourine, cymbals, and other musical instruments that were played by beating.
\p
\v 6 When they arrived at Nakon's threshing floor, one of the cows that was pulling the cart tripped and nearly made the Lord's covenant fall over, so Uzzah reached out and took hold of the chest.
\v 7 Because of Uzzah's mistake, the LORD was very angry with him and immediately killed him in that place. Uzzah died by the side of the Lord's covenant chest.
\p
\v 8 David was angry because the Lord was angry with Uzzah. Then David named the place Perez Uzzah. \f + \fr 6: 8 \fk Perez Uzzah \ft In Hebrew, Perez Uzzah means "outburst of wrath against Uzzah."\f* That was the name of the place until the time the book was written.
\p
\v 9 David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, "It is very dangerous if the chest of the LORD is moved to my city."
\v 10 This made David not want to move the chest of the LORD's covenant to the City of David anymore. So he left the chest at the house of Obed Edom, who was from the city of Gath.
\v 11 The chest of the Lord's covenant was in Obed Edom's house for three months, and the Lord blessed Obed Edom and all his family.
\p
\v 12 And it was told to David, "The LORD has blessed the family of Obed Edom and everything he owns because of the chest of the LORD's covenant." So David made an even bigger and more festive occasion to move the chest from Obed Edom's house to the City of David.
\v 13 According to the procedure set by David, after the people of the tribe of Levi raised\f + \fr 6:13 \fk raised 
\ft. Unlike the previous one, this time the descendants of Levi who carried the Lord's ark of the covenant used poles, and not put on the cart. (1Ch.15: 2, 26) This was the correct way to move the chest according to Num. 4: 1-20. Not all descendants of Levi were allowed to move the ark of the covenant. The descendants of Kohath had this task.\f* When they walked six steps, they stopped and waited when a fat bull and calf would be presented to the Lord.
\v 14 That day, while the process of transfer was going on, David - wearing the priestly uniform made of linen and the ephod\f + \fr 6:14 \fk linen cloth ... \ft The Hebrew text only mentions' the ephod of ( cloth) linen '. But despite Michal's comment in verse 20, David certainly didn't just wear the ephod (Ex. 28: 6-8). It is likely that he wore the priestly clothing that Aaron's sons wore in Exod. 28: 40-43. When David danced by jumping, maybe it showed too many parts of his legs, which (according to Mical) was not suitable for a king, but the TSI translation team felt he could not be accused of being naked.\f* - dancing with all his heart before God.
\v 15 So David and all the people of Israel succeeded in moving the chest of the LORD's covenant to Jerusalem with shouting and trumpets.
\s Michal denounces David
\p
\v 16 As the chest of the LORD entered the City of David, Michal, David's wife, who was Saul's daughter, looked out the window. When he saw King David jump and dance before the Lord, he despised David.
\p
\v 17 The bearers of the Levites put the chest of the Lord's covenant into the tent which David had built for it. Then, according to David's decision, the priests offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord.
\v 18 After the offering ceremony was over, David prayed to bless all the people present.
\v 19 David had also arranged for all the Israelites present to receive a gift of food. So each man and woman was given bread, date cakes and raisin cakes. Then all the people went back to their respective homes.
\p
\v 20 When David returned to greet his family, Michal came out to him and said, “Is that how the king of Israel is doing? How shameful, a king dances in a linen shirt without a robe before the eyes of the slave girls and their servants, like a shameless fool! "
\p
\v 21 David answered to Michal, “I dance before the Lord, who has chosen me as leader over His people to replace your father and the rest of his family. I will keep dancing to thank Him!
\v 22 In fact, I am willing to humble myself even more to the Lord. In your eyes I look embarrassed, but the slave girls you mentioned earlier, they will instead look at me with respect.”
\v 23 Michal, Saul's daughter, was childless until the end of her life.
