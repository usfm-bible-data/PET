\s David appointed king over all Israel
\p
\v 1 Then the leaders from every tribe of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “We are all your own people.
\v 2 In the past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who actually led Israel in battle. And the LORD has said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and be king over them.'"
\p
\v 3 So in Hebron David made an agreement with them before the LORD, and they anointed David as king over Israel.
\p
\v 4-5 David's age when he became king over the tribe of Judah was thirty years. At that time the seat of the government of the kingdom of Judah was in Hebron. There David reigned seven and a half years. Then in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years. So David reigned as king for forty years.
\s David captures Jerusalem
\p
\v 6 After being installed as king, David led his army to attack Jerusalem because the remnant of the Jebusites still controlled the city. The Jebusites said to David, “You will not be able to enter here! Even the blind and the lame in this city can throw you out." They said this because they thought, "David and his men will not be able to break through this city fortress."
\v 7 In fact, later on David succeeded in taking control of the fortified city — which was also called the fortress of Zion, but later it was known as the City of David.
\p
\v 8 When David heard the Jebusite's insult, he said to his troops, “Come on! This city is defended by the "lame" and "blind", and I hate them! Whoever is ready to attack them must enter through the waterways." (This is the origin of the saying, "Blind people and lame people are not allowed to enter the palace.")
\p
\v 9 After the Israelites defeated the Jebusites, David made the city of Jerusalem his capital and named it the City of David. He expanded and strengthened the city around the fortress, starting from the outside all the way in.
\v 10 David became even more powerful, because the LORD God Almighty was with him.
\p
\v 11 One day King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David. They made a deal so that Hiram sent cedar wood, carpenters, and masons to build a palace for David.
\v 12 Thinking of all these things, David realized that it was the LORD who had confirmed him as king over Israel, and the reason God did this was to bless his people, the nation of Israel.
\p
\v 13 After David moved from Hebron to Jerusalem, he remarried several women there and also took concubines. They bore David more sons and daughters.
\v 14 These are the names of the sons of David who were born in Jerusalem: Shamua, Sobab, Nathan, Solomon,
\v 15 Yibar, Elisua, Nefeg, Yafia,
\v 16 Elisama, Eliada and Elifelet.
\s David defeats the Philistines\f + \fr 5:17 \fk chronological order \ft It is likely that this war with the Philistines occurred before David expanded the city of Jerusalem (1 Sam. 5: 9), and it could be that this war occurred before it took that city.\f*
\p
\v 17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed and appointed king over Israel, they assembled an entire army to attack David. But David heard about this and went down with his army to a shelter in a hilly area.\f + \fr 5:17 \fk a refuge ... \ft In Hebrew ani in this verse, when the Philistine army 'went up' to 'seek 'David, David' descends' to the shelter. Usually in Israeli culture, when going to the capital city of Jerusalem, it is always called "going up", even though the hill of Zion is not very high. The opposite direction is usually called 'down'. Therefore, it is thought that the shelter where David descended with his troops was a cave in a hilly area near the village of Adulam. See 1 Sam. 22: 1 and the notes.\f*
\v 18 Philistine armies arrived and their camps were scattered in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 19 Then David asked the LORD, “Are you going to come forward now to attack this Philistine? Will you give me victory over them? " The LORD answered, "Go, for I will give you victory over them."
\p
\v 20 So David attacked and defeated them at Baal Perasim. Then David said, "The LORD has broken through my enemy like a flood from a dam." So he named the place Baal Perasim, which means "God breaks through".
\v 21 The Philistines left their idols there, and David and his army took them as booty.\f + \fr 5:21 \fk booty \ft The idols that were taken from the Philistine army were not meant for worshiped by the people of Israel. But they must have been decorated with gold, silver, or gemstones. And take the gods from the enemy side as a sign of great victory over them.\f*
\p
\v 22 After some time, the Philistine army returned and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
\v 23 So David asked the LORD for guidance. This time the LORD answered, “Don't go directly to face them. Go around in circles so you and your troops can attack them starting from that group of balm trees.
\v 24 When you hear footsteps like a troop marching from the top of the trees, act. For by that time, I had advanced before you and defeated the Philistine army. "
\v 25 David did what the LORD had commanded him, and he slaughtered the Philistines from Gibeon to Gezer.
