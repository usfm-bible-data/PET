\s The last message from David
\p
\v 1 Here is the last message from David, the author of beautiful songs of praise, chosen by the God of Jacob and raised from a low place to be king of Israel:
\q1
\v 2 “The Spirit of the LORD has spoken through me!
\q2 The words I speak are from Him.
\q1
\v 3 The God of Israel is like a refuge on a rock. It is he who said to me,
\q2 'When a king rules justly based on fear and honor toward Me
\q2
\v 4 he will be a blessing to his people, as the light of the sun rises on a bright morning,
\q2 and like the sunshine after the rain that makes the grass sparkle.'
\b
\q1
\v 5 This is how the LORD views the rule that will go on by way of my descendants.
\q2 That is why He made an eternal covenant with me, a covenant that has been established and will not change.
\q2 And because of that covenant He always guarantees my safety and grants everything I want.
\b
\q1
\v 6-7 But the wicked are like a thorn bush.
\q2 So that people are not struck by its thorns, the bush is gathered up, not by hand, but with iron or wood, and then burned up completely.
\q1 In this way the wicked will be gathered together for eternal punishment!"
\s David's mighty soldiers\x + \xo 23:7-17 \xt 1 Ch 11:10-19\x*
\p
\v 8 These are the names of David's soldiers who received the highest honor:
\p There were three main officers. The first was Josheb Basshebeth, the Tahkemonite.\f + \fr 23:8 \fk Josheb… \ft At 1 Ch. 11:11 a shorter name was given to this person, namely Jashobeam, the Hachmonite.\f* He became the leader of the three officers. Josheb was a very skilled spearman.\f + \fr 23:8 \fk with his spear \ft The meaning of some of the words in the Masoretic Text in this verse is very difficult to determine. TSI translated 'With his spear' according to the text contained in 1 Ch. 11:11.\f* With his spear, he killed eight hundred men in one battle.
\p
\v 9 The second was named Eleazar, son of Dodo, grandson of Ahohi. He became one of the main officers because at a certain time when the Israelite army was fighting the Philistines, all the soldiers withdrew. Only Eleazar remained with David to face them.
\v 10 But Eleazar persevered and killed many enemies until his hands were exhausted and his muscles were stiff, so he could not let go of his sword. Because of Eleazar, the LORD gave a great victory that day. When Israel's retreating army returned to the area, they stayed to loot the belongings of the dead Philistine soldiers.
\p
\v 11 The third was named Shammah, a child of Agee, from the area of Harari. One day Philistine troops attacked Israelite forces in the area of Lehi. The battle took place in a field filled with red bean plants.\f + \fr 23:11 \fk red bean \ft The plants referred to in the Hebrew text are called lentils in English. The plant and seed skin are similar in shape to red beans in Indonesia, but lentils are smaller and brown in color.\f* The Israelis fled,
\v 12 but Shammah stood in the middle of the field to defend it. He defeated the Philistines by himself, and through him the LORD gave Israel a great victory.
\p
\v 13-14 The three main officers were also included in the group of thirty top officers. During the harvest season, the Philistines wanted to plunder Israel's crops. A group of Philistine troops were already encamped in the valley of Rephaim, and another group occupied the city of Bethlehem. David and some of his troops took refuge in the Cave of Adulam. One day, the three officers came to see David.
\v 15 David said, "Ah, I want to drink water from the well by the gate of Bethlehem!"
\v 16 At this, the three officers broke through the camp of the Philistines until they passed the post in Bethlehem. Then they drew water from the well and brought it to David. But David didn't drink it. He poured out the water as an offering to the LORD
\v 17 saying, "O LORD, I will not drink this water, because its value is worth the blood of the three people who risked their lives to take it." So David didn't want to drink. That was one of the bold actions taken by the three top officers.

\p
\v 18 Abishai, the younger brother of Joab, son of Zeruiah was commander of the thirty superior officers. He once killed three hundred enemy soldiers with his spear. Because of that he became as famous as the three main officers.
\v 19 Although Abishai was highly respected and was their commander, he was not among the three main officers.
\p
\v 20 Benaiah, son of Joiada, from the city of Kabsel was a brave man who did many great things. He once killed two mighty men from Moab. Also on a snowy day, he chased a lion until it fell into a hole [** trap in the ground to kill him.
\v 21 Benaiah also defeated an Egyptian of great stature. The Egyptian wielded a spear, while Benaiah faced him armed with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
\v 22 These courageous actions made Benaiah famous as the three main officers.
\v 23 He was highly respected among the thirty leading officers, but was not included in the top three. David made him commander of his escort.
