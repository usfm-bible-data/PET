\s Absalom returns to Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Joab\x + \xo 14: 1 \xt 2 Sam. 2:13, 18\x* realized that King David was deeply saddened by the loss of Absalom.
\v 2 Therefore, Joab devised a plan to solve the king's problem. He ordered a messenger to the city of Tekoa to pick up a woman who was known to be smart. When he arrived, Joab said to him, “I asked Mother to pretend like she was grieving. Wear mourning clothes and don't wear perfumed oils. Act as if you have long mourned the death of a member of your family.
\v 3 Then go to the king and tell him what I have taught you." Joab also told the mother what to say.
\p
\v 4 When the wily mother faced the king, she bowed down in honor of him, then said, "Lord King, please help me!"
\p
\v 5 The king asked, "What is your problem?"
\p The mother also said, “I am a widow.
\v 6 I have two sons. One day, they were fighting in the fields. Since no one stopped their fighting, his brother beat his younger brother to death.\f + \fr 14: 6 \fk his brother ... \ft Although Hebrew does not differentiate between the ages of the two children, it is much more natural in Indonesian for a mother telling by mentioning 'brother' and 'sister.' It could happen that his younger brother killed his brother.\f*
\v 7 Now all our family members are demanding that I give up his brother, so that he should be executed to avenge his brother's death. But if he is killed, there will be no more heirs of my late husband. Thus extinguished my only hope to leave offspring on behalf of my husband on this earth.
\p
\v 8 The king answered him, "Yes. Please come home. I will issue an order so that your son is not sentenced to death because of the events that have already occurred."
\p
\v 9 The woman then said, “My lord, if anyone feels that your decision is unfair, let me and my father's family be responsible for the guilt. Your lord and your kingdom won't be held guilty of this decision."
\p
\v 10 The king said, "If there is a family member who is still demanding the death of your son, bring him before me, then I guarantee that he will not bother you again."
\p
\v 11 He answered, "O Lord, I promise before the Lord your God that the family member who wants to avenge my son's blood will not kill my son who is still alive. Don't let any more bloodshed." The king answered, "I promise before the LORD who lives that your son will not be harmed in the least."
\p
\v 12 Then the mother said, "My lord, please let me talk to you about another matter."
\q1 David answered, "Go ahead."
\p
\v 13 The woman also said, "By your decision, you can see that you have done something wrong that is detrimental to God's people, because you have not recalled your son who was in exile.
\v 14 Sir, we will all die. And those who have died cannot live again, just as water that has been spilled on the ground cannot be recovered. But God does not take people's lives, but He always opens the way for those who have been far from Him to return. Likewise we should do with our children.
\p
\v 15 "My lord, when a member of my family threatened me, I came to speak to you because I thought, 'Maybe the king will grant his servant's request.'
\v 16 That's right! The king had listened and released me from the hands of those who wanted to kill me and my child. If my son is killed, we will lose the inherited land that Allah has given us!
\v 17 But now my heart is calm, because I am sure that the Lord's decision will bless me and all God's people. The master is wise like an angel, because he always knows the difference between good and evil. May the LORD God always be with you!"
\p
\v 18 Then the king said to the woman, “Now I will ask you a question. Don't hide anything from me!"
\p He replied, "Yes, sir."
\p
\v 19 Then the king asked, "Did Joab tell you to do all this?"
\p The woman replied, "Yes sir! Before my Lord the King I swear that it is true, because there is nothing that can be kept secret from you. Joab sent me, he even taught all that I said to you.
\v 20 Your servant Joab did this so that the King could see the matter between Lord and Absalom from a different perspective. Master is wise like an angel. That is why you know everything that is happening in this country."
\p
\v 21 Then the king said to Joab, "Very well! I agree to do what you want. Bring Absalom back here!”
\p
\v 22 So Joab bowed down to thank King David. Joab said, “Today your servant knows that my Lord is pleased with me, because you have granted your servant's request!"
\p
\v 23 Then Joab went to the city of Geshur to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.
\v 24 But David said, "Absalom may only return to his own house, but don't let him come to me." So Absalom returned to his house and did not come to the king.
\s1 Absalom makes peace with David
\p
\v 25 Throughout Israel, Absalom was praised for his good looks. From head to toe, there is no flaw.
\v 26 Once a year, Absalom shaved his head when he felt he was too heavy. The weight of the hair that is cut can be up to two and a half kilograms.
\v 27 Absalom had three sons and a very beautiful daughter, whose name was Tamar.
\p
\v 28 It had been two years since Absalom lived in Jerusalem, but he was not allowed to appear before the king.
\v 29 Then Absalom summoned Joab one day, and wanted to send him before the king to ask to see him. But Joab didn't come. A second time, Absalom called Joab, but he still did not come.
\v 30 So Absalom said to his servants, “Joab has a field next to mine. There are barley plants ready to be harvested there. Burn the fields!" So Absalom's servants burned Joab's field.
\p
\v 31 So Joab came to Absalom's house and protested, "Why are your employees burning my fields?!"
\p
\v 32 Absalom answered, “Because I called you, but you did not want to come. I meant to ask you to go to the king and ask, 'Why should you send me home from Geshur if you don't want to see me? I better stay there. Let me come to Father. If I am guilty, I am willing to be sentenced to death!’"
\p
\v 33 So Joab went to the king and delivered the message to him. Then the king called Absalom. Absalom came and bowed before him. Then David embraced his son.
