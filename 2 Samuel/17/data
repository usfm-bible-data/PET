\s1 Hushai foils Ahithophel's plans
\p
\v 1 After that, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Sir, let me choose twelve thousand people. We will go after David tonight.
\v 2 This is a good opportunity because David and his men are tired. I will attack him suddenly, so that all the people who follow him will panic and leave David. Only he himself will be killed.
\v 3 In this way I will bring all the people to you, just as a bride returns to her husband. You only want the life of one person, so that all the rest of the people will be saved.\f + \fr 17:3 \fk textual differences \ft Due to some difficulties in the Masoretic Text, quite a number of translations, including the TSI, have chosen to follow the Septuagint. One way of translating the Masoretic Text is as follows: Then I will bring all the people back to my Lord. You only need to kill him, while the others will be saved."\f*
\v 4 Absalom and the elders of Israel agreed to Ahithophel's plan.
\p
\v 5 Even so, Absalom said, “Call Hushai the Arkite. Let us hear his opinion on this."
\v 6 When Hushai came, Absalom explained Ahithophel's advice to him, then asked, “What do you think? Should we follow Ahithophel's advice? If you disagree, explain your proposal."
\p
\v 7 So Hushai answered Absalom, “Sir, this time Ahithophel's plan is not good.
\v 8 You know for yourself what David is like. He and the army with him are mighty warriors. Surely they are angry and have become as ferocious as a mother bear whose cub was stolen. Besides, your father is very experienced with war. He will not spend the night with his troops.
\v 9 It is possible that by this time he is already hiding in a cave or some other place. If we attack and any of your soldiers are killed, the news will surely spread that many from Absalom's army were slaughtered.
\v 10 When your supporters hear the news, even soldiers as brave as lions will be terrified! For all Israel knows that your father is a formidable warrior, and the army with him is mighty.
\p
\v 11 “Therefore, my advice is to gather the entire army of Israel from the north to the south of the land, so that their number cannot be counted. Then you yourself lead them into battle.
\v 12 Like dew falling to the ground, we will surround David wherever he hides. Neither he nor his soldiers will escape!
\v 13 If he takes refuge in a city surrounded by a fortress, the entire army of Israel will surround it, break down its fortress, and destroy the city!"
\p
\v 14 Hearing this, Absalom and all the Israelites said, "Hushai's advice is better than Ahithophel's advice." Thus the LORD thwarted Ahithophel's plan, which was actually more appropriate. For the LORD wanted to bring havoc on Absalom.
\s David goes to Mahanaim
\p
\v 15 After that, Hushai immediately went to see Zadok and Abiathar. He shared what Ahithophel's advice was and his own. Then he said,
\v 16 “Therefore, get people to deliver this message to David: Tonight they should not stay at the crossing of the Jordan River. They must go straight into the wilderness on the other side of the river, so that David and all those who are with him will not be killed."
\p
\v 17 So the two priests sent a slave girl to deliver the news to Jonathan and Ahimaaz, who were waiting by the spring of En Rogel, not far from the city of Jerusalem. The two of them did not enter the city so that they would not be suspected by Absalom. They were ready to receive the news and to go and tell King David.
\v 18 But a young man saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz at En Rogel, and he reported this to Absalom. So they quickly hid in someone's house in Bahurim village. There was a well in the yard, and they went in there to hide.
\v 19 Then the mistress of the house covered the hole in the well with a cloth and sprinkled grains of wheat on it, so that it was as if she were drying wheat in the yard. There didn't seem to be a well there.
\p
\v 20 Some of Absalom's soldiers came to the house and asked the lady, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?"
\p She replied, "They have crossed the creek." So the soldiers kept looking, but could not find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 21 After Absalom's soldiers had left, Jonathan and Ahimaaz came out of the well and went to King David and said, "Hurry to cross the Jordan River tonight!" They reported Ahithophel's advice to Absalom to kill David.
\v 22 So that night David and all who were with him crossed the Jordan River. By the time the sun rose, everyone had reached the other side.
\p
\v 23 Meanwhile, when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not being followed, he saddled his donkey and returned to his hometown. He gave final messages to his family, then hanged himself. Thus Ahithophel died. He was buried next to his father's grave.
\p
\v 24-26 David's party had arrived at Mahanaim when Absalom and his army had finished crossing the Jordan River. Then Absalom and the Israelites camped in the area of Gilead. Absalom had made Amasa head of the army to replace Joab. (Amasa was Joab's cousin. Amasa was the son of Ithra from Ishmael's line. His mother was named Abigail, son of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, who was Joab's mother.)\f + \fr 17:24-26 \fk Amasa's family \ft Ithra's name can also be spelled Jether. The Masoretic text and some Septuagint manuscripts write that Ithra was an "Israelite", but "descendants of Ishmael" [# this information is // synchronous] with 1 Chron. 2:17. The Masoretic text writes a variation of Abigail's name, namely Abigal. It turns out that Abigail and Zeruiah are sisters. While David is their half brother from a different father. See 1 Ch. 2:12-17.\f*
\p
\v 27 After David was in Mahanaim, three people came to greet and help him. They were
\li2 Shobi, the son of Nahash from the city of Rabbah in the land of Ammon,
\li2 Makir, son of Ammiel from the city of Lodebar,
\li2 and Barzillai, a Gileadite from the city of Rogelim.
\v 28-29 They were already thinking, "David's group will certainly be hungry, tired, and thirsty in this wilderness." That's why they delivered
\li2 bedding,
\li2 bowls and cooking utensils made of clay,
\li2 as well as food,
\li3 namely sheep and goats, wheat, barley, flour, roasted wheat, nuts, seeds, and honey, cheese and dairy products.
