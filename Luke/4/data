\s Jesus is tested by the devil
\r (Matt. 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13)
\p
\v 1 When Jesus left the Jordan River, God’s Spirit had filled Him. And God’s Spirit led Him to go and stay in the desert.
\v 2 Jesus was tested there by the devil for forty days. During all of that time He didn’t eat at all, and after that He was very hungry.
\v 3 Then the devil said to Him, “You’re God’s Son,\f + \fr 4:3 \fk God’s Son \ft Before Jesus was born on this earth, God had announced in Ps. 2:7, “You’re My Son. Today I proclaim that I’m Your Father.” The writer of Hebrews in the New Testament states (in Heb. 1:5) that this verse is about Jesus. And before Jesus’ birth, the angel Gabriel announced to Mary (in Luke 1:35), “The Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of the Most High will come upon you so that the holy Child whom you give birth to will be called God’s Son.” So God Himself is the one who announced that Jesus was His Son before He was born on this earth, and we call Him ‘God’s Son’ in agreement with God’s Word. And from Luke 1:35, it’s clear that Mary conceived Jesus, not because of a sexual relationship with God or man, but because of the power of the Holy Spirit. (John 4:24).\f*right?! So make these rocks become bread!”
\p
\v 4 Jesus answered, “It is written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘People's lives don’t depend only on bread.’”\x + \xo 4:4 \xt Num. 8:3\x*
\p
\v 5 Then in an amazing way, the devil took Jesus to a high place, and in the blink of an eye he showed Him all the kingdoms that are in the world.
\v 6 The devil said to Him, “I'll give you all of the authority and glory of this, because all of it was given to me, and I can give it to anyone that I want.
\v 7 So if you\f + \fr 4:7 \fk you \ft Even though the devil knew that Jesus was God’s Son, the pronoun ‘you’ is written with a small letter because the devil didn’t respect Him as he should have.\f* kneel and worship me now, all of this will become Your possession.”
\v 8 Jesus answered him, “It's written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘Worship the Lord your God,
\q2 and He is the only one you must serve.’”\x + \xo 4:8 \xt Num. 6:13\x*
\p
\v 9 Then in just a short time the devil carried Jesus to Jerusalem and put Him on the highest point of God’s House. He said, “If you really are God’s Son, jump down!
\v 10 For it’s written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘God will order the angels to guard you.’\x + \xo 4:10 \xt Ps. 91:11\x*
\m
\v 11 And it also says,
\q1 ‘They’ll catch you in their hands
\q2 so that your foot won’t get cut by hitting a stone.’”\x + \xo 4:11 \xt Ps. 91:12\x*
\p
\v 12 But Jesus answered him, “It's also written in the Holy Bible,
\q1 ‘Don’t intentionally test the Lord your God by doing something that opposes His will.’”\x + \xo 4:12 \xt Num. 6:16\x*
\m
\v 13 After Jesus was tested in various ways like that, the devil went and left Him. But the devil was looking for another opportunity to test Him.
\s Jesus teaches the crowd
\r (Matt. 4:12-17; Mark 1:14-15)
\p
\v 14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee. He was full of the Holy Spirit’s power, and the news about Him spread to the whole region.
\v 15 He taught in the Jewish synagogues\f + \fr 4:15 \fk Jewish synagogues \ft In New Testament times, the synagogues were used as general meeting places for the local Jewish people and were also used as places for the Jewish people to pray and hear God’s Word. The synagogues were different from God’s House, which was in the city of Jerusalem and was also called God's Temple. Burned sacrifices were only done in God’s House, whereas synagogues were built in every city and village where the Jews lived.\f* which were there, and He was praised by everyone as being a good man.
\s Jesus is rejected in the village He came from
\r (Matt. 13:53-58; Mark 6:1-6)
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus went to Nazareth, the place He grew up. He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath Day as he usually did. Then He was given the opportunity to stand before the congregation to read God’s Word.
\v 17 It happened that the scrolled book which was given to Him contained the writing of the Prophet Isaiah. Then Jesus opened the scrolled book and found the verses written like this,
\q1
\v 18 “The Spirit of the Lord is on Me,
\q2 and God has commissioned\f + \fr 4:18 \fk commissioned \ft Literally, “anointed (with oil).” The root word for anointed is also the same as for the name of Jesus’ position, namely “Christ.” See the note in Luke 2:11.\f* Me to tell the good news to poor people.
\q1 I'm also sent by Him to tell the good news to prisoners
\q2 so that through My ministry they’ll soon be set free,
\q2 and to blind people
\q2 so that their eyes will be healed,
\q1 and to those who are oppressed
\q2 so that they’ll be set free.
\q2
\v 19 And the Lord sent Me to announce this:
\q2 ‘It is now the time when God promised to show His kindness to us!’”\x + \xo 4:19 \xt Is. 61:1-2\x*
\p
\v 20 Then Jesus rolled up the scrolled book and returned it to the official, and He sat down. Everyone present in that meeting house paid serious attention to Him.
\v 21 Then He began to speak to them, saying, “Today, the prophecy in that text was fulfilled when you heard Me read it.”
\p
\v 22 In the beginning everyone said good things about Jesus. Some people said, “All of his lessons are very good and enjoyable to hear.” And there were also those who were amazed and said, “Wow, how can a son of Joseph possibly teach like this?!”\f + \fr 4:22 \fk Wow, how can a son of Joseph... \ft Literally, “Isn’t he Joseph’s son?!” The people who said that were from Jesus’ village who knew Him, for sure, and remembered Joseph, who was considered to be His father. (It’s quite likely that when this happened Joseph was already dead.) But they were amazed with His lessons, and His authority when teaching.\f*
\p
\v 23 Then He said to them, “You will certainly say to Me what people often say, which is ‘Doctor, heal yourself.’ And by that saying you mean to say this, ‘We’ve heard that you did miracles in Capernaum. Do the same things here in your own village.’”
\v 24 Then Jesus said, “What I’m telling you is true. No prophet is appreciated in his own home town.
\v 25 And this is also very true. There were many widows in Israel at the time of the Prophet Elijah, that is when rain didn’t fall for three and a half years, and a famine happened in this whole land.
\v 26 But Elijah wasn’t sent to a single one of the widows of his own land and people, but just to help a widow in the village of Zarephath, near the city of Sidon.
\v 27 And at the time of the Prophet Elisha, there were many people who were sick with leprosy in Israel, but Elisha didn’t heal even one of them. Only Naaman, a man from the land of Syria, was healed by him.”
\p
\v 28 When they heard Jesus teach that, they realized that He wasn’t going to do any miracles for them. Then the crowd in that synagogue became very angry.
\v 29 They stood up and chased Him out of the village. Nazareth was built on a hill, so they drove Him to the edge of a cliff and wanted to push Him over the edge.
\v 30 But Jesus just passed through the middle of them and left.
\s Jesus drives an evil spirit out of a man of Capernaum
\r (Mark 1:21-28)
\p
\v 31 Jesus went to Capernaum, a city in the province of Galilee. On the Sabbath Day He taught the people in the synagogue there.
\v 32 When they heard His teaching, they were amazed because He spoke like a king who had the authority to rule.
\v 33 There was a man at the synagogue who was possessed by a demon. The man cried out loudly,
\v 34 “Hey you, Jesus the Nazarene! Don’t bother us! Have you\f + \fr 4:34 \fk you \ft In this verse, the pronoun to replace Jesus uses a small letter. Even though this evil spirit knew that Jesus was God’s Son, he didn’t respect and submit to Him. (James 2:19)\f* come to destroy us?! I know who you are! You’re the holy messenger from God.”
\v 35 Jesus immediately ordered the demon, “Be quiet! Come out of that man!” Then the evil spirit threw the man to the floor in front of the people who were present, and it went out of the man without hurting him.
\p
\v 36 Everyone there was very amazed and said to each other, “Wow! Jesus’ teaching is really extraordinary! Like a king who gives commands with full authority, Jesus orders the evil spirits to come out and they come out.”
\v 37 So news about Jesus spread to the whole region and the surrounding area.
\s Jesus heals many people
\r (Matt. 8:14-17; Mark 1:29-34)
\p
\v 38 Jesus left the synagogue and went to Peter’s house.\f + \fr 4:38 \fk Peter \ft Literally, “Simon.”\f* Peter’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they asked Jesus to heal her.
\v 39 Then He stood next to her and ordered the fever harshly, “Be healed.” And at that moment the woman was healed. Then she got up and served them.
\p
\v 40 When the sun began to set,\f + \fr 4:40 \fk When the sun began to set \ft The Sabbath Day for Jews started from the setting of the sun on Friday until the sun set on Saturday. So the residents of that city waited until the Sabbath Day was over so that they could bring sick people to Jesus. And before the sun set, Peter’s mother-in-law served them with the food which had been prepared before the Sabbath Day, because according to the Law, they weren’t permitted to light a fire or cook on the Sabbath Day.\f* every sick person in the city was brought to Jesus by their family members. He healed the sick people of whatever illness they were suffering from by putting His hand on each of them.
\v 41 And demons also came out of many people. The demons cried out, “You’re God’s Son!” But Jesus harshly rebuked them. He didn’t permit\f + \fr 4:41 \fk didn’t permit \ft Even though what the demons screamed was true, Jesus didn't want the testimony of demons. \f* them to speak because they knew that He was the Christ.\f + \fr 4:41 \fk Christ \ft See the note in Luke 2:11.\f*
\s Jesus goes to other cities
\r (Mark 1:35-39)
\p
\v 42 The next morning Jesus went to a guiet place, but the crowd looked for Him. And when they found Him they tried to restrain Him so that He wouldn’t leave them.
\v 43 But He said to them, “I have to take the Good News about God’s kingdom\f + \fr 4:43 \fk God’s kingdom \ft is the ‘rule of God’ over everyone who obeys Him. Just as Jesus obeyed the will of God to the point of surrendering Himself as a sacrificial offering, so each of God’s people must also surrender themselves to follow His will. (Mark 8:34; Rom. 10:9-10, 12:1-2). In that way we prove that we’ve become citizens of God’s kingdom, and are worthy to receive everything God has promised to His chosen people since the beginning. When Jesus returns, God will rule in reality on this earth just as He always rules in heaven. See Dan. 7:13-14 and Matt. 6:10\f* to other cities too, because I was sent into this world for that reason.”
\v 44 So He went and told the Good News in the synagogues in the province of Judea.
