\s Jesus sends out seventy two of His followers
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus chose seventy two\f + \fr 10:1 \fk seventy two \ft Regarding this number, there are two variations in ancient copies of the Greek language. Some of them say 'seventy' and some others say 'seventy two'. The same number is repeated in verse 17. The old translations that set more of the standard of KJV (1611) all use 'seventy', whereas translations that follow the texts of UBS lean toward using 'seventy two'.\f* other followers. Then He sent them to go out in pairs to every city and place that He would visit.
\v 2 Jesus said to them, “All of these wheat fields are ready to be harvested, but there are few people to harvest them. Because of that, pray that the Lord who owns these fields will send out workers to harvest all of this wheat.\f + \fr 10:2 \fk Verse 2 \ft To understand the meaning of the analogy in this verse, read John 4:35-38.\f*
\p
\v 3 “Now go! And pay attention! I’m sending each of you into a dangerous situation, as when sheep are attacked by a group of wolves.
\v 4 Don’t take a wallet, a bag or an extra pair of sandals. And don’t stop to talk with people you meet on the way.
\v 5 Before you enter a person's house, first say, ‘Greetings everyone! May you as a family feel calm in the protection of the Lord!’
\v 6 If there is a person in that house who desires the calmness of the Lord, then he’ll receive you, and the Lord will bless him and his family according to those words. But if there isn’t a person there who wants the calmness of the Lord, then your blessing won’t happen to them.
\v 7 Stay only with that family until you leave that village. Don’t move around. Eat and drink only whatever they serve you, because every worker has a right to get his pay.
\p
\v 8 “If you enter a city and the people there receive you, eat whatever they serve you.
\v 9 Heal the sick people in that city and tell its residents, ‘In a short time God will come and set up His kingdom in this world.’
\p
\v 10 “But if you enter a city and the people don’t receive you, go to the main streets of that city and shout,
\v 11 ‘We’re removing even the dust of this city that sticks to our feet as a warning to you that God will punish you! But know this, in just a short time God will come and set up His kingdom on this earth!’
\v 12 I’m telling you the truth, on the Judgment Day, the punishment that will fall on the residents of that city will be far greater than the punishment that will fall on the residents of the city of Sodom!”
\s The punishment for people who don’t want to believe
\r (Matt. 11:20-24)
\p
\v 13 “You people of Chorazin are so unfortunate! You people of Bethsaida are so unfortunate! God’s judgment will be so horrible for you. For if the miracles that I’ve done among you had happened in the past in Tyre and Sidon too, then they would have repented long ago and shown their sincerity by sitting, wearing mourning cloth and putting ashes on their heads.
\v 14 On the Judgment Day, the residents of Tyre and Sidon will get a lighter punishment than you.
\v 15 And you residents of Capernaum too, you think that you’ll be raised up to get great honor in heaven. No! You’ll be thrown into hell!\f + \fr 10:15 \fk hell \ft Literally, “Hades,” which is the place for evil people after they die. See Luke 16:23; Rev. 20:13-14.\f*
\p
\v 16 “In God’s eyes, everyone who hears you as My messengers is considered to be hearing Me. Everyone who rejects you when you give My message is considered to be rejecting Me. And everyone who rejects Me rejects God who sent Me.”
\s The seventy two messengers of Jesus return
\r (Matt. 11:25-27, 13:16-17)
\p
\v 17 Not long after that, the seventy two followers returned to Jesus. They gladly said, “Lord, by Your name even the demons obeyed us.”
\p
\v 18 And Jesus said to them, “That’s true! At the time you drove out demons, it was as if I saw the devil fall from the sky like lightning.\f + \fr 10:18 \fk Verse 18 \ft This verse is translated with the interpretation that Jesus is explaining a spiritual reality, not what He literally saw with His eyes. In a different interpretation, Jesus tells what He has seen literally, whether it was at the time the messengers were working or before that time. That interpretation can be translated, “I’ve seen the devil fall from the sky like lightning.”\f*
\v 19 Pay attention! I’ve given you authority so that when you step on snakes or scorpions, or even face the powers of darkness, nothing will harm you.
\v 20 Even so, don’t rejoice because the evil spirits obey your commands. But rejoice because your names are listed in heaven.”
\p
\v 21 At the same time, the Holy Spirit gave extraordinary joy to Jesus. Then He said, “I praise You Oh Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You’ve hidden the teachings about Your kingdom from people who are wise and have much knowledge! But You reveal those things to whoever is ready to accept the true teaching with hearts that are innocent, like small children. Yes that’s true, Father, because that’s what pleases Your heart!
\p
\v 22 “Everything has been turned over to Me by My Father. No one knows Me His Son except the Father. And no one knows My Father except Me and the people that I want to introduce to Him.”
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus turned away from the crowd and said to His disciples only, “You’ve each been truly blessed by God because you’ve been given the opportunity to see what’s happening now with your own eyes.
\v 24 I’m telling you the truth. Many prophets and kings wanted to see and hear what you’re seeing and hearing now. But that blessing wasn’t given to them.”
\s The parable about the kind-hearted Samaritan
\p
\v 25 Then a Law expert stood up among the crowd. He intended to test Jesus with his question. He said, “Teacher, what must I do in order to have eternal life?”
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered him, “What’s written in the Law? What answer do you see there?”
\p
\v 27 The man answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with your whole heart, with all your life,\f + \fr 10:27 \fk all your life \ft translates the word that is usually translated “soul.” The meaning of this word in Greek is quite broad so that it covers ‘breath’, ‘life’ and the whole personality, including physical and spiritual life. The PET does not use ‘soul’ in this verse because it’s hard to understand how one can intentionally do something with his soul in this life. For most people, the soul is just that part that continues living after death.\f* with all your thoughts and with all your strength.’ And ‘Love your fellowman just like you love yourself.’”\x + \xo 10:27 \xt Deut. 6:5; Lev. 19:18\x*
\p
\v 28 And Jesus said, “Your answer is correct. Do those things and then you’ll have eternal life.”
\p
\v 29 But because the man wanted to justify himself, he said to Jesus, “Who is my fellowman?”
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus answered him with this parable. “There was a man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho. On the way he was attacked by some robbers who took all of his possessions, even his clothes. They beat him till he was half dead. After that they went away and left him alone there.
\p
\v 31 There happened to be a priest, one of those who worked in God’s House, who was going down the road. When he saw the man he avoided him and passed by him on the other side of the road.
\v 32 It was the same with a man from the tribe of Levi who was a servant in God’s House. He went that way and saw the man. Then he also avoided him and went past on the other side of the road.
\p
\v 33 Then a Samaritan man was traveling on that road. When he saw the man he had compassion on him.
\v 34 He approached the man, cleaned his wounds by pouring wine on them, poured on olive oil as an ointment and then bandaged them. After that he put the man on his donkey and brought him to a rooming house and took care of him there.
\v 35 The next day, the Samaritan gave two silver coins\f + \fr 10:35 \fk silver coins \ft See the note in Luke 7:41.\f* to the owner of the rooming house. He said, ‘Take care of him. If the payment is still not enough, I’ll pay when I come back.’”
\p
\v 36 Jesus ended His story by asking him, “In your opinion, which one of those three men was a fellowman to the victim of that robbery?”
\p
\v 37 The Law expert said, “The man who had compassion on him and helped him.”
\p Jesus said to him, “Go and do the same thing.”
\s Jesus visits Mary and Martha
\p
\v 38 While Jesus and His disciples were on a trip, they arrived in a village. A woman of that village named Martha received Him into her home.
\v 39 The sister of Martha, named Mary, sat near Jesus’ feet and kept listening to His teaching.
\v 40 But Martha was continually busy because she was doing so much serving. So she came to Jesus and said, “Lord, don’t You care that this woman is letting me work alone?! Please tell her to help me.”
\p
\v 41 Then the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you worry and make trouble for yourself about many things!
\v 42 However only one thing is important. Mary has chosen the thing that’s best and most important. That’s a blessing that no one can take away from her.”
