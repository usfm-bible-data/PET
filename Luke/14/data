\s Jesus heals another sick person on the Sabbath Day
\p
\v 1 One Sabbath Day Jesus went to the house of a prominent Pharisee and ate there. The members of the Pharisee group kept watching Him closely because they wanted to find some fault so that they could accuse Him of breaking the Sabbath Day regulations.
\v 2 Then something unusual happened. A man who was bloated, whose hands and feet were swollen, was sitting right in front of Jesus!
\v 3 Then Jesus asked the Law experts and the Pharisees who were present, “According to the Law, is it permisable to heal a sick person on the Sabbath Day or not?”
\v 4 But they were just silent. Then Jesus touched and healed the sick man and ordered him to go.
\v 5 Then He said to each of them, “If your child or your cow falls into a well on the Sabbath Day, you would lift it out of the well too, right?!”
\v 6 None of them was able to oppose what Jesus said.
\s Don’t be conceited
\p
\v 7 Jesus saw how all of those who were invited tried to sit in the most honored places. Because of that He told them all this parable.
\v 8 “When a person invites you to a wedding feast, don’t sit in the most honored place. For it’s possible that the master of the house has invited a person who has more honor than you.
\v 9 If that happens, the master of the house will come and say, ‘Please give this place to my close friend.’ And you’ll be ashamed and move to a place that’s the farthest from the honored place.
\p
\v 10 But when you’re invited to a wedding feast, sit in a place that’s far from the most honored place. Then the person who invited you might come and say to you, ‘Friend, sit in a place that’s more honored!’ In that way you’ll gain respect before everyone who’s present there.
\v 11 For whoever elevates himself will be humbled by God. And whoever humbles his heart will be elevated by Him.”
\p
\v 12 Then Jesus said to the Pharisee who had invited Him, “When you hold a dinner party, don’t just invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives or your neighbors who are rich because some other time they’ll pay you back by inviting you to their party in return.
\v 13 But when you hold a party, invite the poor, disabled, paralyzed and blind.
\v 14 They won’t be able to repay you, but God is the one who’ll repay you and bless you. And you’ll also be repayed when the righteous are brought back to life.”
\s The parable of a huge dinner party
\r (Matt. 22:1-10)
\p
\v 15 When one of the guests who sat there eating heard this, he said to Jesus, “Everyone who’s invited to the dinner party that will be held later on in God’s kingdom is truly blessed by God.”
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus said to him, “Once there was a rich man who invited many people to a huge dinner party.
\v 17 When the party was ready to begin he ordered his slave to go to each of the invited guests saying, ‘Come, everything’s ready.’
\v 18 But each of them had an excuse so that they couldn’t come. The first person said, ‘I’ve bought a field and have to go see it. I’m sorry.’
\v 19 Another one said, ‘I’ve bought ten bulls.\f + \fr 14:19 \fk ten bulls \ft The word in Greek indicates the bulls had been castrated, called oxen. Bulls that were castrated were more easily controlled to pull a plow which was usually pulled by two oxen. This man was probably rich because he was able to buy ten oxen.\f* Now I want to go try them out. Sorry!’
\v 20 And another one said, ‘I’ve just gotten married so I can’t come. Sorry!’
\p
\v 21 The slave returned and told all of that to his master. The master was angry and said to him, ‘Go quickly to the roads and alleys of this city. Invite the poor people, the disabled, the blind and the paralyzed to come here.’
\p
\v 22 Not long after that the slave came and reported, ‘Master, I’ve done what you ordered me to do, but there are still empty places.’
\v 23 Then the master said to him, ‘Go to the main streets and the small roads outside the city. Urge everyone to come here so that my house is full.
\v 24 And I swear that those who’ve rejected my invitation won’t come and won’t eat any of the food that was prepared for my party!’”
\s Consequences for people who want to become followers of Jesus
\r (Matt. 5:13, 10:37-39; Mark 8:34-38, 9:50; Luke 9:23)
\p
\v 25 After that, many people walked along with Jesus. He turned around and saw them and said,
\v 26 “Everyone who comes to Me and wants to become My follower has to love Me more than\f + \fr 14:26 \fk love Me more than \ft Literally, “hate”\f* his mother and father, his children and wife, all of his brothers and sisters and even himself.
\v 27 You can’t possibly become My followers if you don’t keep following me with thoughts like this, ‘Even if it means my death— even if I am crucified, I won't turn back!’\f + \fr 14:27 \fk even if I am crucified \ft Literally, “he must carry the cross for himself.”\f*
\p
\v 28 “Your decision to follow Me can be illustrated by the following example. If a person plans to build a tower, he’ll count the cost first, of course, so that he knows if he has enough funds to finish the job.
\v 29 He doesn’t just want to build the foundation and not be able to finish it, because everyone who sees it will make fun of him:
\v 30 ‘That man began to build but he wasn’t able to finish it!’
\p
\v 31 Or for example if a king has ten thousand soldiers but another king who has twenty thousand soldiers plans to attack him, the first king will consider carefully beforehand like this, of course, ‘Am I able to oppose that enemy?’
\v 32 If he feels that his soldiers aren’t able to oppose his enemy’s army, then while the enemy is still far away he’ll send some important people to discuss the conditions for peace.
\p
\v 33 “It’s the same with each of you! If your possessions are more important than Me, then you aren’t My follower.”\f + \fr 14:33 \fk Verse 33 \ft In a more literal way,Jesus said, “In order to become My follower you have to leave all of your possessions.”\f*
\p
\v 34 “Each of you who follows Me is like salt. Salt is used to make food tastier, of course. But if its taste has disappeared that salt won’t be useful at all,
\v 35 either for the field or as fertilizer. In the end the salt is just thrown out.
\p “You have ears, don’t you?! So listen well!”
