\s John the Baptist prepares God’s people for the coming of Jesus
\r (Matt. 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; John 1:19-28)
\p
\v 1-2 When Tiberius’ had been the high king of the Roman kingdom for fifteen years, God led John, the son of Zechariah, to begin his ministry. At the same time,
\q1 Pontius Pilate held the position as governor of the province of Judea,
\q1 Herod ruled as king in the province of Galilee,
\q1 Philip, his brother, was king in the provinces of Iturea and Trachonitis,
\q1 and Lysanius ruled as king in the province of Abilene.
\q1 And in Jerusalem, Annas and Caiaphas held the position of high priest.
\m At that time, God began to give His message through John, who lived in the desert.
\v 3 John went around to the whole region of the Jordan River and announced this, “Each of you have to repent of your sins so that God will forgive you. And to show that you want to keep following the Lord, come to me so that I can baptize you.”
\v 4 So this John is the one God meant in the prophecy of Isaiah’s book where he wrote,
\q1 “Later on a man will cry out in the desert like this,
\q2 ‘Prepare the way for the Lord’s coming! Make the way straight for Him!’”\x + \xo 3:4 \xt Is. 40:3\x*
\q1
\v 5 “Every valley should be filled in,
\q2 and every mountain and hill should be leveled.
\q1 Every road that zig-zags should be straightened,
\q2 and every road that is full of holes should be repaired.
\q1
\v 6 In that way, everyone will get the opportunity to understand
\q2 how he can be saved by God.”\f + \fr 3:5-6 \fk Quotation from the Prophet Isaiah \ft John quoted Is. 40:3-5. Leveling ground and straightening roads illustrate that everything which hinders the work of the Lord in individual lives should be eliminated.\f*
\p
\v 7 Many people came to John to be baptized. He said to them, “Hey, you descendants of poisonous snakes! Don’t think that you can free yourself from God’s punishment which will come!
\v 8 For that reason, show by your actions that you’ve truly repented. And don’t say in your heart, ‘I won’t be punished by God because I’m a descendant of Abraham.’ I’m telling you that God is able to change these stones to become descendants of Abraham!
\v 9 Like a farmer who cuts down a tree that never bears fruit and burns it, God is also ready now to do away with our people and throw them into the fire!”\f + \fr 3:9 \fk Ayat 9 \ft Literally, (with implicit information), “The axe (which illustrates the punishment of God) has been prepared to chop down the grape vine (which illustrates the people of Israel) to its roots. Every vine which doesn’t produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.” This illustration was natural for John’s listeners because of the words of two prophets. In Jer. 2:21, Israel was illustrated as a grape vine which didn’t produce good fruit. And in Ezek. 15, Israel was illustrated as a grape vine which wasn’t useful because it wasn’t faithful to the Lord.\f*
\p
\v 10 Then the crowd asked him, “So what should we do so that God doesn’t punish us?”
\p
\v 11 He answered them, “Whoever has two shirts should give one to a person who doesn’t have any. If you have food, share it with people who’re hungry too.”
\p
\v 12 Some tax collectors\f + \fr 3:12 \fk tax collectors \ft At the time of Jesus, Israel was colonized by the kingdom of Rome. So if a Jew became a tax collector, he was considered to be a person who betrayed his own people. For that reason the tax collectors were considered to be sinners by all other Jews. They were also hated because they liked to collect more taxes than was correct. Because of that the tax collectors became rich.\f* came to be baptized. They asked John, “Teacher, what should we do?”
\p
\v 13 He answered them, “Stop collecting more taxes than what the Roman government determines.”
\p
\v 14 There were even some soldiers who asked him, “And what about us? What should we do?”
\p He answered them, “Don’t use force, threats or false accusations against a person in order to get money from him. Be satisfied with your wages.”
\p
\v 15 Because of John’s ministry, people waited full of hope, and asked in their hearts, “Is John the Christ\f + \fr 3:15 \fk Christ \ft See the note in Luke 2:11.\f* whom we’re waiting for?”
\p
\v 16 John answered all of them, “I’m baptizing you with water, but a Man will come who has more authority than I do. I’m not worthy to serve Him, not even to carry His sandals. He’ll baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
\v 17 Because of that, repent, for this world is like a field which is ready to be harvested, and the good produce will be separated from the bad! For He who is coming after me will judge this world and separate all of you who are evil from midst of righteous people. The righteous will live with Him, but all the evil people will be thrown into the fire of hell which will never be extinguished.\f + \fr 3:17 \fk verse 17 \ft Literally (with implicit information) could be translated like this, “The threshing tool and winnowing basket are already in His hands (illustrating punishment from God). After the harvest, (everyone in this world) He will use His tools to separate the wheat (illustrating good people) from the husks of the wheat and other dirt (illustrating evil people). Then He’ll keep the wheat in His storehouse, while He'll burn the rest in the fire which will never be extinguished.” What has been translated above as “threshing tool and winnowing basket” is literally a “cleaning tool,” which is like a shovel or large fork that’s used to separate the wheat from its outer husk. This verse can be compared with Rev. 14:14-20 and Matt. 25:31-46.\f*
\v 18 John told the Good News to the crowd by giving much advice like that.
\s John’s work ends
\p
\v 19 John rebuked King Herod because he had taken off with Herodiana, his brother’s wife,\f + \fr 3:19 \fk Herodiana... \ft This name is often written as ‘Herodias’. The spelling Herodiana was chosen so that it’s obvious that this is a woman’s name.\f* and because he had done other evil things too.
\v 20 Then Herod added even more to his evil deeds by putting John in prison.
\s John baptizes Jesus
\r (Matt. 3:13-17; Mark 1:9-11)
\p
\v 21 While John was baptizing the crowd, he also baptized Jesus. And as Jesus was praying, the sky opened up,
\v 22 and the Holy Spirit came down on Him in the form of a dove. Then a voice from the sky was heard which said, “You’re My Son whom I love very much, and You please My heart.”
\s Geneology of Jesus
\r (Matt. 1:1-17)
\p
\v 23-38 Jesus was thirty years old when He started His ministry. According to what people thought, he was the son of Joseph. These are the forefathers of Jesus based on that line of thought:\f + \fr 3:24-38 \fk the forefathers of Jesus \ft This list is ordered according to the way people usually list their ancestors, which begins with the oldest ancestro and then his descendants. In the original text, Luke wrote the reverse, which begins with Joseph and ends with Adam. This list is also made without repeating each name. If followed from the top down, then the name which follows is the name of the son.\f*

\q1 (27-29) Levi, Matthat, Jorim, Eliezer, Joshua, Er, Elmadam, Cosam, Addi, Melchi, Neri, Shealtiel, Zerubbabel, Rhesa, Joanan,
