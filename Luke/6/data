\s Jesus is Lord over the Sabbath Day
\r (Matt. 12:1-8; Mark 2:23-28)
\p
\v 1 Once when it was the Sabbath Day, Jesus and His disciples walked through a broad field of wheat. As they walked, the disciples picked several stalks of wheat, rubbed them in their hands to take off the husk, and then ate the seeds.
\v 2 Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing that?! You’re breaking the Sabbath Day regulations.”
\p
\v 3 Jesus answered, “Of course you all know the story about David, when he and the men who followed him were hungry and needed food.
\v 4 He entered God’s Tabernacle and accepted the bread which was always placed in the Holy Room. Then David took it to the men who followed him, then they ate that bread. However according to the Law of Moses, only the priests could eat it.\x + \xo 6:4 \xt Lev. 24:9; 1 Sam. 21:1-6\x* But because they needed food, no one considers what David did to be a sin.”
\v 5 Jesus said to the Pharisees again, “I, the Son of Man,\f + \fr 6:5 \fk Son of Man \ft See the note in Luke 5:24.\f* am the Lord who has the right to determine what may or may not be done on the Sabbath Day.”
\s Jesus heals a sick man on the Sabbath Day
\r (Matt. 12:9-14; Mark 3:1-6)
\p
\v 6 On another Sabbath Day, Jesus went to teach at a Jewish synagogue. There was a man there whose right hand was paralyzed.
\v 7 There were also some Law experts and Pharisees there who were watching Jesus closely because they were looking for a reason to be able to report Him to the Jewish leaders. So they wanted to know if He would heal a person on the Sabbath Day.
\v 8 Jesus knew what was in their minds, so He said to the man whose hand was paralyzed, “Get up and stand here in front.” The man just got up and stood there.
\v 9 Jesus said to them, “Think about this, according to Moses’ Law, what may we do on the Sabbath Day? Are we allowed to do good or to do evil? Or are we allowed to save someone’s life or to kill someone?”
\p
\v 10 He looked around at the people and finally said to the sick man, “Straighten your hand out in front.” He did it, and his hand was immediately healed.
\v 11 The Law experts and the Pharisees were very angry. Then they said to each other, “What should we do to Jesus?”
\s Jesus chooses twelve apostles
\r (Matt. 10:1-4; Mark 3:13-19)
\p
\v 12 One day, Jesus went up on a hill to pray. He prayed all night there.
\v 13 The next morning, He called the crowd that was following Him, then chose twelve of them to become His disciples. He also appointed them as His apostles.\f + \fr 6:13 \fk apostles \ft See the footnote about 'apostles' in Matt. 10:2.\f* Their names were:
\q1
\v 14 Simon, to whom Jesus gave the new name “Peter,”
\q1 Andrew, the biological younger brother of Peter,
\q1 James, John,
\q1 Philip, Bartholomew,
\q1
\v 15 Matthew, Thomas,
\q1 James, the son of Alphaeus,
\q1 and Simon who had followed the movement of people who fought to free Israel from the colonization of Rome.
\q1
\v 16 There were also two men named Judas. The first was Judas, the son of James,
\q1 and Judas who came from the village of Cariot. He was the one who would later betray Jesus.
\s Jesus teaches, and heals sick people
\r (Matt. 4:23-25, 5:1-12)
\p
\v 17 Then Jesus went down the hill with His disciples and stopped at a level place. A large number of people who followed Him were already there, and many other people too who came from all of the province of Judea, Jerusalem and the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon.
\v 18 They came to hear Jesus and to ask to be healed from their diseases. And there were many people who were healed of being bothered by evil spirits.
\v 19 All of those people tried to touch Jesus, because power went out from Him so that they were all healed.
\p
\v 20 He looked specifically at His disciples and said,
\q1 “All of you who are poor are truly blessed by God,
\q2 because you’re the ones who will become citizens of God’s kingdom.
\q1
\v 21 You who are hungry now are truly blessed by God,
\q2 because you’ll be satisfied.
\q1 You who are crying now are truly blessed by God,
\q2 because you will laugh.
\q1
\v 22 You who are hated, insulted, rejected and slandered because you become followers of Me, the Son of Man, are truly blessed by God.
\v 23 When you’re made to suffer like that, rejoice and dance for joy because your reward in heaven will be great!
\q2 For remember the prophets who lived in times past were also persecuted like that by the forefathers of the people who are making you suffer now.”
\q1
\v 24 But all of you who are rich now are unfortunate,
\q2 because the pleasure you enjoy in this world won’t be repeated again in God’s kingdom.
\q1
\v 25 You who are satisfied now are unfortunate,
\q2 because you’ll experience hunger.
\q1 You who laugh now are unfortunate,
\q2 because you’ll mourn and cry.
\q1
\v 26 If everyone praises you, you’re unfortunate.
\q2 For remember, the false prophets who lived in times past were also praised like that by the forefathers of people who are now praising you.”
\s Love your enemies
\r (Matt. 5:38-48, 7:12)
\p
\v 27 “But this is My command to each of you who hear this teaching of Mine, love the people who oppose you and do good to those who hate you.
\v 28 Ask God to bless those who curse you, and pray for those who do evil to you.
\v 29 For example, if someone slaps your left cheek, give him your right cheek too. And if someone takes away your robe, let him take your tunic too.
\v 30 If someone asks you for something, give it to him. And if someone takes away your possessions, don’t ask for them back.
\v 31 And treat other people the way that you want other people to treat you.
\p
\v 32 If you just show love to your friends who love you, don’t hope that God will bless you because you showed them love. For even sinful people show love to those who love them.
\v 33 Or if you just do good to your friends who do good to you, don’t hope that God will bless you because of your good deeds. For even sinful people do the same thing.
\v 34 And if you only loan money to people who can repay it, don’t hope that God will bless you because of doing that. For even sinful people give loans to fellow sinners, that is to people who’ll be able to return the loan in the same amount.
\p
\v 35 Instead, you should love those who oppose you, do good to them, and loan money without hoping it will be returned. In that way, God will give you a great reward, and all your deeds will prove that you are worthy to call Almighty God your Father. For He’s also kind to people who never say thanks and to evil people.
\v 36 You should show compassion, just like our Father in heaven shows compassion.”
\s Examine yourself
\r (Matt. 7:1-15)
\p
\v 37 “Don’t make yourself a judge of the wrongs of others, so that you won’t be judged in the same way too.\f + \fr 6:37 \fk Verse 37A \ft Literally, “Don’t judge, and you won’t be judged.” This verse and Matt. 7:1 are known as verses that in general are used wrongly. This prohibition doesn’t contradict other verses in the Bible that show the different ways God’s people need to determine if others deeds are wrong or right. This verse must be understood according to the teaching of Jesus that follows in this chapter.\f* Forgive other people, then God will forgive you.
\v 38 Help other people, then God will also help you. And God will add more than what you need when He repays you for your kindness. When God blesses you, He’ll use a standard of measure that’s greater, and make that container full and really pressed down to the point that the excess spills out to the right and left. For the standard of measure that you use to give to other people will be remembered by God when He repays you for your kindness.”
\p
\v 39 Jesus told them this example, “If a blind man leads a fellow blind man, they’ll definitely both fall into a hole.\x + \xo 6:39 \xt Matt. 15:12, 14\x*
\v 40 A student can’t be greater than his teacher, but the student who finishes all of his training will become like his teacher.
\p
\v 41-42 “Don’t accuse another person for a small fault. Whoever does that is like someone who notices sand in his brother’s eye while he doesn’t notice the beam of wood in his own eye. Then he arrogantly says to his brother, ‘Come here and I’ll remove the sand from your eye!’ Hey, you who only pretend to be good people! First remove the beam that’s in your own eye, and after that you can see clearly to remove the sand that’s in your brother’s eye.”
\s Example of two kinds of trees
\r (Matt. 7:17-20, 12:34b-35)
\p
\v 43 “A good tree can’t possibly produce fruit that isn’t good, right? In the same way a tree that’s known to produce fruit that can’t be eaten won’t produce delicious fruit.
\v 44 For every tree is known by its fruit. A thorn bush can’t possibly produce figs, and other thorny plants can’t possibly produce grapes.
\v 45 People are also like trees. A good person always produces good deeds because all of his deeds come from what’s kept in his heart. But an evil person always produces evil deeds because of the evil that’s kept in his heart. For whatever is kept in the heart and continually thought about will come out of the mouth, for sure.”
\s Example of two kinds of people
\r (Matt. 7:24-27)
\p
\v 46 “Why do you call Me, ‘Lord, Lord’, but you don’t do what I command!
\v 47 Let Me give this example to illustrate everyone who comes to Me, hears My teaching and does it:
\v 48 They’re just like a man who builds a house. First he digs a deep hole in the ground until he finds a large, solid rock. That rock is used as the foundation for other stones. When there’s a flood and the river overflows and crashes into that house, the house isn’t shaken because it was built on a foundation of solid rock.
\v 49 However, a person who hears My teaching, but doesn’t do it, is like a man who builds a house without a foundation just on top of the ground. When there’s a flood and the river overflows and crashes into that house, it will fall apart and be severly ruined.”
