\li1
\v 11 Josiah was the father of Jechoniah\f + \fr 1:11 \fk Jechoniah \ft His other name was Jehoiachin.\f* and his brothers. At that time, many Jewish people were taken as prisoners of war to the land of Babylon.
\li1
\v 12 While the Jewish people were still prisoners of war in Babylon,
\li1 Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel.
\li1 Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel.
\li1
\v 13 Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
\li1 Abiud was the father of Eliakim.
\li1 Eliakim was the father of Azor.

\v 14 Azor was the father of Zadok.

\v 15 Eliud was the father of Eleazar.
\li1 Eleazar was the father of Matthan.
\li1 Matthan was the father of Jacob.
\li1
\v 16 Jacob was the father of Joseph.
\li1 Joseph was the husband of Mary,
\li1 and Mary was the mother of Jesus, who was called the Christ.\f + \fr 1:16 \fk Christ \ft is a word from Greek which means ‘anointed one’. In Hebrew, the same term is ‘Messiah’. That term denotes a position, like ‘district head’ or ‘governor’. In Old Testament times, each king was anointed with olive oil by a prophet as a sign of being chosen and confirmed by God. And all of the priests and prophets of that time were also anointed. It’s appropriate to call Jesus ‘The Anointed One’, because He holds the position of prophet, High King, and our High Priest (Heb. 4-10). Because of some of the prophecies in the books of the prophets and the Psalms, at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people in general knew the meaning of ‘Christ’ as the King of Salvation, whom God promised, who would come from the descendants of King David, free the nation of Israel from those who opposed them, set up a government with the power of God, and rule with justice. See Is. 9:6-7; Gen. 3:15; Deut. 18:18-19; Mic. 5:2; Zec. 12:10-14; Mal. 3:1, 4:5-6; Ps. 2, 16, 22, 40, 110\f*
\p
\v 17 So, there were fourteen descendants from Abraham to David, and fourteen descendants from David until the time the Jewish people were taken to Babylon. And from the time the Jewish people began to live in the land of Babylon until Christ was born, there were also fourteen descendants.
\s1 The birth of Christ Jesus
\r (Luke 2:1-7)
\p
\v 18 This is the story about the birth of Christ Jesus. A young virgin named Mary was engaged to Joseph. Mary was the one who would later become Jesus’ mother. But before they were married, it happened that Mary got pregnant because of the power of the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Joseph, Mary’s fiance, was an honest and kind-hearted man. When Mary told Joseph about her pregnancy, he didn’t want to shame Mary in public by saying that she had committed adultery. So he planned to break off his engagement with Mary in a quiet way.
\p
\v 20 But while Joseph was thinking about that, an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, descendant of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife because the child that’s in her womb came from the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 Mary will give birth to a boy Child, and you will name Him Jesus,\f + \fr 1:21 \fk Jesus \ft The name Jesus in Greek means the same as the name Joshua in Hebrew. Both names mean “the LORD saves.”\f* because He is the one who will save His people from their sins.”
\p
\v 22 God was obviously arranging all of these things to happen so that what He spoke through the word of His prophet would be fulfilled,
\q1
\v 23 “A virgin will conceive and give birth to a boy Child, and He’ll be named Immanuel.”\x + \xo 1:23 \xt Is. 7:14\x*
\m (The name Immanuel means, “God is with us.”)
\v 24 So Joseph got up from his sleep and did what the angel of the Lord told him, that is he quickly married Mary.
\v 25 However, Joseph didn’t have sexual relations with Mary until the Child was born. And after the Child was born, Joseph named Him Jesus.
