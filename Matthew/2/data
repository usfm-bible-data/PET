\s Astrologers visit Jesus
\p
\v 1 Jesus was born in the city of Bethlehem in the province of Judea. At that time, Herod ruled as king of Judea under the government of the kingdom of Rome. Then several astrologers came\f + \fr 2:1 \fk Astrologers \ft They may have been members of a religious group who were well educated who came from the region that’s now called Iran. They visited Jesus when He was between the age of 40 days (Luke 2:22) and two years. (Matt. 2:16)\f* from a land far to the east of Jerusalem.
\v 2 They asked, “Where’s the Child who was just born, the one who will become King of the Jews? For we saw a star rise in the east, which is a sign of His birth, so we also came to worship Him.”
\v 3 When King Herod heard the news about the king of the Jews who was just born, he was angry because he felt there was competition. And all the residents of Jerusalem were troubled too.
\v 4 Then Herod called the chief priests and the Law experts and asked them where the Christ would be born.
\v 5 They answered, “In the city of Bethlehem, Judea. For a prophet has written these words of God,
\q1
\v 6 ‘You residents of Bethlehem, in the region of Judah,
\q2 now you are no longer considered to be an unimportant town in that region!
\q1 For a leader will be born among you,
\q2 who will lead My people, Israel.’”\x + \xo 2:6 \xt Mic. 5:2\x*
\p
\v 7 Later, Herod held a closed meeting with the astrologers. That’s how he got precise information from them as to when the star appeared for the first time.
\v 8 Then he ordered them to go to Bethlehem and said, “Go and find out exact information about that Child. And when you meet Him, tell me, so I can go to worship Him too.”
\p
\v 9-10 After that meeting, the astrologers left. When they saw the star rising in the east again they were really joyful. Then the glow of that star guided them, and it stopped above the house where the Child was.
\p
\v 11 So they entered the house where the Child was. Then they saw the Child with Mary, His mother, and knelt down and worshiped Him. They opened their bags and offered various gifts to the Child, which were gold, incense and myrrh.\f + \fr 2:11 \fk incense and myrrh \ft Incense was tree sap, which if burned had a very fragrant smelling smoke. It was expensive and often burned by Jewish priests as an offering to God. Myrrh was an expensive fragrant oil. It was used to prepare bodies to be buried. The oil can also be mixed with wine to drink to decrease pain.\f*
\v 12 But not long after that God told them through a dream not to return to Herod. Because of that they went home to their land by another way.
\s Jesus escapes to Egypt
\p
\v 13 After the astrologers left, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream. The angel said, “Get up! Take the Child and His mother to Egypt quickly. Stay there until I come again, bringing orders for you to return, because Herod plans to find the Child in order to kill Him.”
\p
\v 14 That very evening Joseph got up and headed to Egypt with Mary and Jesus.
\v 15 They stayed in Egypt until Herod died. In that way what was spoken by God through His prophet was fulfilled, “I’ll call My Child out of Egypt.”\f + \fr 2:15 \fk Quote \ft Matthew quoted from Hosea 11:1. In that context, Hosea referred to all the people of Israel as ‘God’s child’, so this verse can be translated in the context of time past. But Matthew used that verse as a prophecy, so it is translated here using the context of a time to come, as Matthew intended.\f*
\s Herod kills all the little boys of Bethlehem
\p
\v 16 When Herod realized that the astrologers had deceived him, he became very angry. Then he ordered his soldiers to kill all the boy children of Bethlehem, and in all the region around it, that is the children who were two years old and under. He estimated that the Child was two years old, according to the explanation of the astrologers.
\v 17 Then what was spoken by God through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled,
\q1
\v 18 “A voice was heard in the city of Ramah,
\q2 that is the voices of crying and lamenting because of very deep sad feelings.
\q1 Rachel was crying for her children,
\q2 and she didn’t want to be comforted
\q2 because her children had died.”\f + \fr 2:18 \fk Quote \ft Matthew quoted from Jer. 31:15. The city of Ramah was included in the broader region of Bethlehem, and was only five kilometers north of Jerusalem.\f*
\s Joseph and Mary return from Egypt
\p
\v 19 After Herod died, Joseph and his family were still in the land of Egypt. Then an angel of the Lord came to him again in a dream.
\v 20 The angel said, “Get up, and go back to the land of Israel with Jesus and Mary! For the people who were trying to kill Him are dead!”
\p
\v 21 So Joseph got up and immediately left with them for the land of Israel.
\v 22 But when Joseph heard that the one who had replaced King Herod was Archelaus, he was afraid to return to the province of Judea. Archelaus was the son of King Herod himself. Then Joseph received instructions again through a dream, so he took them to the province of Galilee.
\v 23 Then they went to the city which was called Nazareth and lived there. In that way, what was spoken by God through the prophets was fulfilled, which was, “When the Christ comes, He will be called ‘a Nazarene.’”
