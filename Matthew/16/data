\s The Jewish leaders look for a way to accuse Jesus
\r (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
\p
\v 1 Then some of the Pharisees and Sadducees came and began to debate with Jesus. They tried to find a reason to accuse Him, so they ordered Him to do a miracle as proof that God had sent Him.\f + \fr 16:1 \fk as proof that… sent Him \ft Literally, "a sign from heaven.” In the Jewish culture, ‘heaven’ was used to prevent saying ‘God’ directly.\f*
\p
\v 2 Jesus answered with the following illustration, “When the sun begins to set and the sky looks red, you say, ‘The weather will be good tomorrow.’
\v 3 But if the sky is red and dark in the morning you say, ‘It’ll rain today.’ You can know what will happen with the weather just by looking at the signs in the sky, right! Why don’t you know the signs of this age that are happening right now?!
\v 4 Only evil people who are unfaithful to God, like you, demand to see a miracle as a sign of proof! This is the only miracle that you’ll be given, that is the miracle like what happened to the Prophet Jonah.” Then He went and left them.
\s Jesus warns His disciples not to be affected by the yeast of the Pharisee and Sadducee groups
\r (Mark 8:14-21)
\p
\v 5 When Jesus and we disciples of His reached the other side of Lake Galilee, we realized that we had forgotten to bring bread.
\v 6 Jesus said to us, “Beware! Don’t be affected by the yeast\f + \fr 16:6 \fk yeast \ft In a Jewish analogy, they compared yeast with sin because when yeast is put into bread dough, the dough expands. So they compared yeast with sin, which can expand and spread to other people. See 1 Cor 5:6-8 and Gal 5:9.\f* of the Pharisee and Sadducee groups.”
\p
\v 7 Then we began to talk to each other about that, saying, “He said that because we didn’t bring bread.”
\p
\v 8 Jesus knew what we were saying, so He asked, “Why are you talking about the bread you forgot to bring? You don’t have enough faith in Me!
\v 9 It’s so unusual that you don’t yet understand! Why is it hard for you to remember?! When I fed five thousand people with five pieces of bread, how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up?
\v 10 And when I also fed four thousand people with seven pieces of bread, how many baskets full of leftover bread did you pick up?
\v 11 So why don’t you understand that I wasn’t talking about bread earlier, when I said, ‘Don’t be affected by the yeast of the Pharisee and Sadducee groups?!’”
\p
\v 12 We finally understood the point that Jesus was making, that He wasn’t warning us to beware of the yeast that was used to make bread, but to guard against the Pharisees and Sadducees’ teaching.
\s Peter admits that Jesus is the King of Salvation
\r (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21)
\p
\v 13 After we all arrived in the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked us disciples of His, “Whose position do people say I, the Son of Man, am serving in?”\f + \fr 16:13 \fk what position…serving in \ft Literally, “Who am I?” The purpose of this question wasn’t to ask what his name was, because then they would have answered, “Everyone knows Your name is Jesus.” Compare with Matt. 14:2 and Luke 9:7-9.\f*
\p
\v 14 We answered, “There are people who say that You are the successor of John the Baptist, and those who say that You’re the Prophet Elijah or Jeremiah who has come back to life. And there are also those who say that You are one of the other former prophets who has come back to life.”
\p
\v 15 Then He asked again, “But what’s your opinion of Me?”
\p
\v 16 So Peter, who is also called Simon, answered, “You are the King of Salvation,\f + \fr 16:16 \fk King of Salvation \ft Literally, “Messiah.” See the note in Matt. 1:16.\f* and the Son of the living God!”\f + \fr 16:16 \fk Son of the living God \ft See the note in Matt. 4:3\f*
\p
\v 17 Jesus answered, “Simon, son of Jonah, you’ve been really blessed by God because it wasn’t man who made you understand that, but it was My Father who is in heaven.
\v 18 And now I’m telling you, you are Peter, (the Great Rock).\f + \fr 16:18 \fk Peter \ft The meaning of the name Peter is explained by John in John 1:42.\f* and on that foundation stone I will set up My unified church.\f + \fr 16:18 \fk My unified church \ft The word in Greek that’s translated as ‘church’, is ‘ekklesia’, which means ‘a gathering of people’. What Jesus meant was to set up a unified people of God which consists of each person who is filled with God’s Spirit, who are the body of Christ in this world. (Eph. 1:27)\f* And every creature that has power in death’s kingdom\f + \fr 16:18 \fk every creature… death’s kingdom \ft Literally, “the doors of Hades.” Hades is hell.\f* won’t be able to defeat My unified church.
\v 19 I’ll give you the keys of God’s kingdom. In that way, every door that you lock on this earth will also be locked in heaven, and every door that you open on earth will also be opened in heaven.”\f + \fr 16:19 \fk Verse 19 \ft The meaning of this verse is very broad. If the analogy of the keys is translated as is, without using the illustration of keys and doors, then the meaning is like this: “I’ll give you the authority of God’s kingdom. In that way, whatever you forbid on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will also be permitted in heaven.”\f*
\v 20 Then Jesus sternly ordered all of us not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.\f + \fr 16:20 \fk Christ \ft means the King of Salvation, who was promised. See note in Matt. 1:16.\f*
\s Jesus begins to teach that He’ll suffer and be killed
\r (Mark 8:31–9:1; Luke 9:22-27)
\p
\v 21 At that time, Jesus began to show us disciples of His that He had been appointed by God to go to Jerusalem. And He explained, “There the Jewish leaders, chief priests and Law experts will make Me suffer a great deal. Then I’ll be killed, and on the third day I’ll be made alive again by God.”
\p
\v 22 But Peter thought that it wasn’t possible for the King of Salvation to suffer, so he pulled Jesus aside from the rest of us and began to rebuke Him, “God wouldn’t possibly allow that to happen. Don’t think that You’ll experience those things.”
\p
\v 23 Jesus turned to look at Peter and said to him, “Get away from My presence, you devil!\f + \fr 16:23 \fk devil \ft Jesus literally used one of the devil’s names, which is “Satan.” That name means “enemy.” Jesus considered that Peter was speaking as His enemy.\f* You’re becoming an obstacle for Me, because you’re following man’s thinking, not God’s thinking!”
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus said to us, “Whoever wants to follow Me must abandon his own desires,\f + \fr 16:24 \fk abandon his own desires \ft Literally, “deny himself.”\f* and keep following Me, thinking like this, ‘If I die, even if by crucifixion, I’ll keep following the Lord.’
\v 25 For everyone who fights to keep his life will still die, but the person who’s killed because of following Me will gain eternal life.
\v 26 Think about this, what good is it for you to become rich to the point of owning all of earth’s treasures, if you don’t have eternal life. For there’s no treasure that can buy eternal life!
\v 27 For I, as the Son of Man, will leave this earth and will come back with power and with My Father’s shining glory, accompanied by the angels. At that time, I’ll repay everyone according to his deeds.
\v 28 I’m telling you the truth, some of you who are here won’t die before they see the moment I the Son of Man, come and begin to set up My kingdom on this earth.”\f + \fr 16:28 \fk won’t die until… kingdom… \ft When Jesus healed sick people, it showed that God’s kingdom had already defeated sickness, demons and even death. God’s kingdom was also revealed when His disciples saw Jesus on the mountaintop in the glory of heaven. (Matt. 17:1-13). In fact, the moment Jesus died, the Roman officer acknowledged Him as God’s Son, and that meant that Jesus deserved to rule. (Matt. 27:54). And Jesus’ resurrection (Matt. 28) very clearly shows that God’s kingdom already has authority on this earth. Things like that show that a new government has already begun and is visible on this earth.\f*
