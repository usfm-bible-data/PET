\s Jesus healed a man who suffered from a contagious skin disease
\r (Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16)
\p
\v 1 As Jesus went down the hill, many people followed Him.
\v 2 Then a man suffering from a contagious skin disease came to Him.\f + \fr 8:2 \fk contagious skin disease \ft The skin disease that’s meant here wasn’t the same as what’s now called “leprosy.” According to the Law, people suffering from skin diseases of this kind were considered unclean. They couldn’t get close to healthy people, they couldn’t enter the Jewish synagogues and they had to live outside of a town or city. See Lev. 13.\f* He bowed down in front of Jesus and said, “Sir, if you want to, I’m sure you’re able to heal me.”
\p
\v 3 Jesus stretched out His hand and touched\f + \fr 8:3 \fk touched \ft Because of rules in the Law about people suffering from contagious skin diseases, a healthy person rarely touched a person suffering from a skin disease. But in this verse, Jesus touched this sick man, because he knew, of course, that this man would get well.\f* the man and said, “I want to. Be healed!” At that very moment, the skin disease disappeared, and he became well.
\v 4 And Jesus said to the man, “Don’t tell anyone at all about this, but go and show your body to one of the priests. Then give an offering to God, according to Moses’ command to everyone who is healed from a skin disease.\f + \fr 8:4 \fk Moses’ command... skin disease \ft Moses wrote about the healing of skin diseases in Lev. 14:1-32. If a priest agreed that a person was healed, that person had to bring two live birds to God’s House, so that the priests there could perform the ceremony of cleansing from the skin disease. Ceremonies with sacrifices like this weren’t done in the synagogues in their villages.\f* In that way, everyone will know that you really are well.”
\s Jesus heals the servant of a Roman officer
\r (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:43-53)
\p
\v 5 Jesus went to the city of Capernaum. As He entered the city, a Roman officer\f + \fr 8:5 \fk Roman officer \ft Literally in Greek, the word translated as ‘officer’ meant ‘leader over one hundred soldiers’.\f* came to Him and pleaded,
\v 6 “Sir, my slave is lying at home because he’s deathly ill. He can’t move, and he’s really suffering.”
\p
\v 7 Jesus said to the officer, “I’ll come and heal him.”
\p
\v 8 The officer answered, “Sir, I’m not worthy to have you in my home, but I’m asking that you simply give the command that he be healed, and he’ll be healed, of course.
\v 9 I'm also a subordinate person who submits to the command of my superior, and there are also many soldiers under my command. If I say to one of them, ‘Go over there!’, he goes. And if I say to another one, ‘Come here!’, he comes. And if I say to my slave, ‘Do this!’, he just does it. In the same way, I’m also certain that every command of your’s will be fulfilled.”
\p
\v 10 When Jesus heard that, He was really amazed. Then He said to those following Him, “I’m telling you the truth, I haven’t yet met even one person among the people of Israel who has faith as great as the faith of this man.
\v 11 I’m telling you, when God begins to rule over everything as King, there’ll be a big party. Many people will come from every place on earth, even from the farthest point to the east and west. Then they’ll sit down and eat with our forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
\v 12 However, many Jewish people, who were of course invited to enter the kingdom because of their forefathers, will be thrown out into the darkest place. And they’ll cry while suffering severely there.”\f + \fr 8:12 \fk suffering severely \ft Literally, “grind their teeth.”\f*
\p
\v 13 Then Jesus said to the officer, “You may go home, Sir. It has happened according to your faith.” And at that very moment, the officer’s slave was healed.
\s Jesus heals many people
\r (Mark 1:29-34; Luke 4:38-41)
\p
\v 14 After that, when Jesus went to Peter’s house, He found Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed, because she was sick with a fever.
\v 15 So Jesus touched the woman’s hand and her fever disappeared. She even got up and served Jesus some food.
\p
\v 16 That afternoon many sick people were brought to Him, including those who were possessed by demons. By His word alone those evil spirits immediately left them, and He also healed all the sick people.
\v 17 He did this to fulfill what was prophesied by the prophet Isaiah,
\q1 “He is the one who took our suffering
\q2 and healed our diseases.”\x + \xo 8:17 \xt Is. 53:4\x*
\s Regarding the decision to follow Jesus
\r (Luke 9:57-62)
\p
\v 18 When Jesus noticed the crowd that gathered around him, He said to His disciples, “Let’s leave and go across the lake.”
\v 19 Then a Law expert came to Him and said, “Teacher, I’ll follow You wherever You go.”
\p
\v 20 Jesus said to him, “Wild dogs have holes and birds have nests, but I, who am the Son of Man,\f + \fr 8:20 \fk Son of Man \ft While Jesus lived on earth, He often called Himself  “the Son of Man.” But the meaning of that term isn’t directed at the word ‘son’. In the Hebrew language, ‘son of man’ means “normal human being’. Jesus called Himself that to remind His listeners about what the Prophet Daniel witnessed in a vision of the King of Salvation. (Dan. 7:13-14) Daniel saw Jesus in heaven in the form of a ‘son of man’, meaning in the form of a ‘normal human being’, when God appointed Him King over everything. In this translation, ‘ I am’ is often added so that it’s clear that Jesus is speaking about Himself.\f* don’t have a place to rest.”
\p
\v 21 And another person who often followed Jesus said to Him, “Sir, let me go home first. When my father dies and is buried, then I’ll follow you.”\f + \fr 8:21 \fk dies and is buried \ft Literally this verse says, “Let me go home first to bury my father.” This verse was translated according to Jewish culture and the interpretation that his father hadn’t died yet. Apparently, responsibility to his family was more important than following Jesus. There are others who say that this man might have wanted to receive his inheritance before following Jesus.\f*
\p
\v 22 But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me now, and let the people who are spiritually dead wait for one of their own to die.”
\s Jesus stops a storm
\r (Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25)
\p
\v 23 Then Jesus got into a boat with His disciples and left for the other side of the lake.
\v 24 Suddenly a huge storm came up on the lake. The waves pounded against the boat and lots of water came in so that the boat almost sank. But at that moment, Jesus was sleeping soundly.
\v 25 Then they came to wake Him up. They said, “Sir, help! We’re going to drown!”
\p
\v 26 Jesus answered, “Why are you so afraid? You don’t have enough faith in Me!” Then he stood and commanded the strong wind and the waves to stop. So the wind just stopped, and the lake became peaceful again.
\p
\v 27 They were amazed and said, “Wow, what kind of a man is this?! Even the strong wind and the waves obey him.”
\s Jesus drives evil spirits out of men from the Gadarenes
\r (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39)
\p
\v 28 When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, which is the region of the Gadarenes,\f + \fr 8:28 \fk Gadarenes \ft A region on the southeast side of the Lake of Galilee. That region is also called Gergesenes.\f* two men who were possessed by demons came to meet Him. Those two men lived in the graveyard,\f + \fr 8:28 \fk graveyard \ft At that time, Jewish people often buried dead bodies in caves, or in small rooms which were dug out of a mountain of rock. This story speaks about a lot of unholy things: evil spirits, a graveyard, pigs, and a non-Jewish region. All of those things were considered to be unholy by Jews.\f* and they were so dangerous that no one was brave enough to pass by there.
\v 29 The two men screamed at Him, “Hey, Son of God! Why are you\f + \fr 8:29 \fk you \ft A lower case letter is used here as the pronoun for the name of Jesus. Even though the evil spirits knew that Jesus was God’s Son, they didn’t truly respect Him and submit to Him. (James 2:19)\f* bothering us? Have you come to torture us before the time God has determined?”
\p
\v 30 Not far from there, a large herd of pigs was eating.
\v 31 The demons begged Him over and over again, “If you drive us out of these two men, allow us to enter those pigs.”
\p
\v 32 He said, “Go!” Then the demons left the two men and entered the pigs. And all of the pigs ran and fell from the side of the chasm into the lake and drowned.
\v 33 The pig herders ran to the city and told people about what had happened to the pigs and to the two people who had been possessed by demons.
\v 34 Then all the residents of the city came out to meet Jesus, and they begged Him earnestly to leave their region.
