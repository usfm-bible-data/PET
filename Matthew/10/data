\s Jesus sends out His disciples
\r (Mark 3:13-19, 6:7-13; Luke 6:12-16, 9:1-6)
\p
\v 1 On another day, Jesus gathered us twelve disciples of His together and gave us authority to drive out evil spirits and heal all kinds of diseases.
\v 2 He sent us out as His apostles.\f + \fr 10:2\fk apostles \ft the word 'apostle' is translated from the word 'apostolos' in Greek, which means a person sent to do something in the name of the one who sent him. Oftentimes apostles were sent to carry and deliver news. In the four Gospels, the twelve people listed in this paragraph are usually called 'disciples' of Jesus. But beginning with Acts of the Apostles, they were called 'apostles'.\f* The names of those sent out were as follows:
\qi First of all Peter, who was also called Simon,
\qi with his younger brother Andrew,
\qi then the two sons of Zebedee, James and John.
\qi
\v 3 Then Philip, Bartholomew,
\qi Thomas, and me Matthew, who used to work as a tax collector,
\qi James, the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus,
\qi
\v 4 Simon, who had followed the movement of Israeli's so that they would be free from the colonization of Rome,
\li and Judas who was from the village of Cariot, the one who would betray Jesus.
\p
\v 5 Before Jesus sent us twelve apostles out, He ordered us like this, “Don’t go to the region of non-Jewish people, and don’t enter Samaritan cities.
\v 6 For I’m sending each of you to the people of Israel who’ve wandered like a flock of sheep that has no shepherd.
\v 7 Go and tell them that God will soon set up His kingdom in this world.
\v 8 Heal sick people, bring dead people back to life, heal people who have contagious skin diseases and drive out demons. Just as each of you were freely blessed by God, help and bless other people freely in the same way.
\v 9 Don’t bring money in any form.
\v 10 And don’t bring a bag, a change of clothes, a change of sandals or a walking stick on your trip, because everyone who works deserves to be given what he needs.
\p
\v 11 “Wherever you go, either to a city or village, look for a person who is kind-hearted, who will open the door of his home to you. Stay there until you leave.
\v 12-13 When you enter a person's home, greet everyone who is in the house. And ask God that His feeling of peace will bless and protect them. If they are truly good people, they’ll receive you and receive that blessing from God. But if not, go and they won’t be blessed either.
\v 14 If anyone doesn’t receive you, or doesn’t want to hear what you teach, remove the dirt from your feet and sandals \f + \fr 10:14 \fk remove the dirt \ft Literally “shake the dust off.” At that time, it had become the tradition of Jews that if they were forced to make a trip into a region of non-Jewish people, the moment they left that region, they cleaned off the soles of their feet and their clothes. They did that because they considered non-Jewish people and their land to be unclean and unholy. Jesus ordered His disciples to do the same thing to Jewish people who rejected God’s teaching. In that way, the disciples showed that God considered people who were hard-headed like that to be unholy. That also became a sign that they would be punished by God if they didn’t repent. See another example of this in Acts 18:6.\f* when you leave that house or city.
\v 15 I’m telling you the truth, on the final judgment day, the residents of that city will receive a punishment that’s more severe than the punishment that will be given to the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah.”\f + \fr 10:15 \fk Sodom and Gomorrah \ft were two cities destroyed by God because of the evil of their residents. (Gen. 19)\f*
\s Beware of the trouble that will come
\r (Mark 13:9-13; Luke 21:12-17)
\p
\v 16 “Pay attention! I’m sending you into a terrifying situation, like when sheep are being attacked by a pack of wolves. For that reason, each of you should be as wise as a snake and as innocent as a dove.
\v 17 Beware! You’ll be arrested and taken to face various religious courts. And the leaders of Jewish synagogues will sentence you to be punished by ordering people to whip you.
\v 18 Some of you will also be dragged to face government officials and kings because you tell about Me. This is an opportunity for you to testify about Me to them and to other people who aren’t Jews.
\v 19 If you are tried, don’t be afraid of what to say or how you should defend yourself, because at that very moment what you should say will be made known to you.
\v 20 Because what you actually say in that moment won’t come from yourself, but from the Father’s Spirit who is in you.
\p
\v 21 “The persecution against you will be really horrible, so that later there will even be brothers who hand over their own biological brother to be killed. And the same thing will happen between a father and his own biological child. Children will also oppose their parents and turn them in to be sentenced to death.
\v 22 And many people will hate you because you believe in Me.\f + \fr 10:22 \fk in Me \ft Literally, “because of My name.”\f* But the souls of everyone who remains faithful to me until the end will be saved.
\v 23 If you’re persecuted in one city, run to another city. Because I’m telling you the truth, before you finish visiting every city in Israel, I the Son of Man, will have returned.
\p
\v 24-25 “Don’t think that you’ll be treated better than Me, My children. A student isn’t more well received than his teacher, and a worker isn’t treated better than his master. A student should be satisfied if he’s treated like his teacher. And a servant should be satisfied if he’s treated like his master. Those who oppose Me have called Me Lucifer,\f + \fr 10:25 \fk Lucifer \ft Literally, “Beelzebul.” Beelzebul is another name for Lucifer or satan, who is the leader of the evil spirits. See Matt. 9:34.\f* so they will call you children of mine the same thing, of course.”
\s Fear and respect God, not humans
\r (Luke 12:2-9; Mark 8:38)
\p
\v 26 “For that reason, don’t be afraid of those who oppose us, because everything that people do and their evil plans that are hidden will certainly be revealed and known on a later day.
\v 27 In the same way, what I’m telling you secretly, say it openly. And what I whisper to you, broadcast it to everyone.
\p
\v 28 “Don’t be afraid of men, because they can only kill your body, but they can’t kill your soul. Instead, just fear and respect God, because He’s able to destroy both your body and soul in hell’s fire.
\v 29 Remember this example, a pair of sparrows are sold for the price of the least valuable coin, yet none of them dies without our Father’s knowledge.
\v 30 In fact, He even knows the total number of hairs on your head.
\v 31 So don’t be afraid of those who oppose us, because you are far more important to our Father than many sparrows!
\p
\v 32 “Whoever admits to other people that he’s My follower, I’ll also admit that he’s My follower to My Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever denies to other people that he’s My follower, I’ll also deny that he’s My follower to My Father who is in heaven.”
\s The trouble that Jesus’ followers will experience
\r (Luke 12:51-53, 14:26-27; Mark 8:34-37)
\p
\v 34 “Don’t think that I came to this earth to bring peace. I didn’t come to bring peace, but to bring a sword, that is strong opposition.
\v 35 For by My presence, what was prophesied in the Holy Bible will be fulfilled:
\q1 ‘A son will oppose his father,
\q2 a daughter will oppose her mother,
\q1 and a daughter-in-law will oppose her mother-in-law.
\q2
\v 36 In fact, even your closest family members will become like enemies in disguise.’\x + \xo 10:36 \xt Mic. 7:6\x*
\p
\v 37 “Everyone who loves his father or mother more than Me doesn’t deserve to be called My follower. Everyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me doesn’t deserve to be called My follower.
\v 38 Everyone who follows Me has to think like this, ‘Even if it means my death— even if I am crucified, I won't turn back!’\f + \fr 10:38 \fk even if I am crucified \ft Literally, “he must carry his own cross.”\f* Anyone who doesn’t think like that doesn’t deserve to be called My follower.
\v 39 Everyone who tries to hold onto his life will lose his life, but whoever loses his life because of following Me will gain true life.”
\s God blesses those who accept you
\r (Mark 9:41; John 13:20)
\p
\v 40 “In God’s eyes, a person who accepts you as My messenger is considered to accept Me directly. And whoever accepts Me, accepts God who sent Me.
\v 41 Whoever welcomes a prophet because he’s aware that the prophet is God’s messenger will then take part in receiving God’s blessing like that given to a prophet. And whoever welcomes a righteous person because he really is a righteous person, will take part in receiving God’s blessing like that given to a righteous person.
\v 42 I’m telling you the truth, whoever helps one of My followers, even if it’s simply to give a cup of cold water to the lowliest follower, he will definitely receive a reward from God because of doing that.”
