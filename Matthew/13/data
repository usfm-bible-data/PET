\s1 The parable of the farmer and the seeds that were scattered
\r (Mark 4:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 That same day, Jesus left the house where He had taught, went to the shore of Lake Galilee and sat down there.
\v 2 Because many people came and gathered around Him, He climbed into a boat which was anchored there and sat down to teach the crowd, while they kept standing on the shore.
\v 3 Then Jesus taught them many things using parables like the following:
\p “One day, a farmer went to scatter seeds in a field.
\v 4 As he scattered the seeds, some fell on the road. Then birds came and ate the seeds until they were all gone.
\v 5 There were some that fell on rocky ground too, so the shoots of those seeds came up quickly because the layer of soil was thin.
\v 6 But when the sun’s rays got hot, the shoots of those seeds wilted and dried out because of the thin layer of soil.
\v 7 There were also some seeds that fell into thorny weeds. But the thorny weeds grew taller, so they kept the shoots of those seeds from growing.
\v 8 But some other seeds fell on fertile soil. The shoots of those seeds produced many other seeds. Some seeds produced up to one hundred seeds, and some others produced sixty seeds, and there were also some that produced thirty seeds.
\v 9 You have ears, don’t you?! Listen closely now!”
\s1 The reason Jesus taught using parables
\r (Mark 4:10-12,24-25; Luke 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 Then we disciples of His came and asked Jesus, “Why do You teach the crowd using parables?”
\p
\v 11 Jesus answered, “In the past, people weren’t allowed to understand the teachings about God’s kingdom.\f + \fr 13:11 \fk God’s kingdom \ft See the note in Matt. 6:33.\f* But now you’ve been given permission to understand the teachings that were kept secret. Other people haven’t been given permission yet to understand those things.
\v 12 So God will give more ability to the person who has ability to understand My teachings, so that it increases. But for the person who doesn’t try to remember and understand My teachings, God will take that ability away from him.
\v 13 That’s why I teach them using parables, because even though they see, they don’t pay attention. They hear, but they don’t really pay attention and don’t understand either.
\v 14 So what Isaiah prophesied about them is fulfilled:
\q1 ‘Even though they continue to hear teaching,
\q2 they won’t understand.
\q1 And even though they see miracles,
\q2 they won’t be aware of what happened.
\q1
\v 15 For this people group has become hard-headed.
\q2 Their ears can barely hear,
\q2 and they’ve closed their eyes.
\q1 If that weren’t so, they could possibly see and pay attention to what I’m doing
\q2 and could understand what I’m saying with their ears and hearts.
\q1 In that way, they could repent and return to Me.
\q2 And because of My compassion, I’m always ready to heal them.’\x + \xo 13:15 \xt Is. 6:9-10\x*
\m
\v 16 But all of you are happy because God has given you great blessings. He has allowed you to truly hear with your ears and see with your eyes.
\v 17 I’m telling you the truth, many prophets and righteous people have longed to see and hear what you’re seeing and hearing now, but that blessing wasn’t given to them.”
\s1 Jesus explains the meaning of the parable of the farmer and the seeds that were scattered
\r (Mark 4:13-20; Luke 8:11-15)
\p
\v 18 “Because of that, pay attention to the meaning of the parable of the farmer.
\m
\v 19 “The seeds that fell on the road illustrate people who hear about God’s kingdom but don’t understand it. Then the evil one, that is the devil, comes and snatches away the teaching that was scattered in their hearts.
\m
\v 20 And the seeds that fell on rocky ground illustrate people who hear God’s teaching and immediately accept it with glad hearts.
\v 21 But the teaching doesn’t take root in their hearts, so it doesn’t last long. When they’re faced with troubles or tortured because of following that teaching, they quickly forsake the Lord.
\m
\v 22 The seeds that fell into thorny weeds illustrate people who’ve heard God’s teaching but they’re worried about the daily needs of life in this world. And they’re influenced by the desire to become rich. Thoughts like that hinder the teaching so that it can’t produce fruit in their lives.
\m
\v 23 And the seeds that fell on fertile soil are like people who hear God’s teaching and understand it. Like the fertile soil, they also produce much fruit.\f + \fr 13:23 \fk produce much fruit \ft In other places in God’s Word, we see how people can ‘produce fruit’. First, the Good News from God enables people to believe. We also see that a person can ‘produce fruit’ by faithfully doing what God commands in his life. (Matt. 5-7) We also ‘produce fruit’ if the words which come out of our mouths are good in God’s eyes. (Matt. 12:31-37) And we “produce fruit” if we lead other people to repent. (John 15:16) A life like that is good fruit in God’s eyes.\f* There are those that produce thirty, sixty or even a hundred seeds from one seed.”
\s1 The parable of weeds and wheat
\p
\v 24 Then Jesus told another parable. He said, “God’s kingdom can be illustrated by the owner of a field who ordered his servants to plant good wheat seed in his field.
\v 25 One night, while everyone was sleeping, the owner’s enemy came and scattered seeds from weeds in with the wheat and then left.
\v 26 But when the wheat grew tall and began to produce grain, then the weeds could be seen.
\v 27 The owner’s servants came and asked him, ‘Sir, we planted good seed in that field, right?! So where did the weeds come from that are growing there?’
\p
\v 28 “He answered, ‘My enemy must have done that.’
\p “So the servants asked again, ‘Sir, do you want us to pull up the weeds?’
\p
\v 29 “He answered, ‘Don’t bother, because if you pull them up, the wheat will also be pulled up, for sure.
\v 30 Let the wheat and weeds grow together until the time for harvesting comes. At that time, I’ll tell those who harvest, “Gather up all the weeds first and tie them up to be burned later. After that, the wheat can all be gathered and put in my storehouse.’””
\s1 Parables of the mustard seed and the yeast
\r (Mark 4:30-32,33-34; Luke 13:18-21)
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus told another parable to illustrate a comparison to God’s kingdom. He said, “God’s kingdom is like a bunch of mustard seeds\f + \fr 13:31 \fk mustard seeds \ft The type of mustard plant that grows in Israel can grow to be bigger than mustard plants that grow in other places. In verse 32, the mustard plant in Israel can “become tall like a tree, and birds can build nests in its branches.” What’s important in this parable is that something which starts out very small will grow to become very large. It’s the same with God’s kingdom.\f* that a man took and scattered in his field.
\v 32 Even though the seeds of that plant are the smallest seeds in the world, when a seed grows, it’ll become the largest plant in the garden. In fact, it can grow to become a tree that’s large enough for birds to come and make nests in its branches for shelter.”
\p
\v 33 Then he told another parable. “God’s kingdom is also like yeast that a woman mixes into a large amount of flour.\f + \fr 13:33 \fk a large amount of flour \ft Literally “three satas.” One sata is the same as thirteen liters.\f* Even though there’s just a small amount of yeast in a large amount of flour, all of it expands so that it can be made into bread.”
\p
\v 34 Jesus told the crowd these things about God’s kingdom by using various parables. He always used parables to teach them.
\v 35 Jesus did this so that what was told by a prophet would be fulfilled, which was:
\q1 “I’ll speak using various parables that show a comparison,
\q2 and in that way I’ll reveal things which were kept secret since the world was created.”\x + \xo 13:35 \xt Ps. 78:2\x*
\s1 Jesus explains the parable of the weeds among the wheat
\p
\v 36 After Jesus stopped teaching the crowd, He returned to the house where He was staying. Then we disciples of His came to him and said, “Please explain to us the meaning of the parable of the weeds in the field.”
\p
\v 37 Jesus answered, “The owner of the land who scattered good seeds is Me, the Son of Man,
\v 38 and the field is this world. The good seeds are those who become citizens of God’s kingdom, and the weeds are the devil’s followers.
\v 39 The enemy who scattered the seeds of weeds is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the servants who reap the harvest are the angels.
\p
\v 40-42 “So at the end of the age, when I rule as the Son of Man, I’ll send My angels to gather up and throw out all the people who persuade others to sin and everyone who does evil. They’re like the weeds which were gathered and then they’re thrown into the place of hell fire. They’ll always be crying there as they suffer severely.
\v 43 But the people who are righteous will enter God’s kingdom to live with their Father, where they’ll shine like the sun. You have ears, don’t you?! So listen closely!”
\s1 God’s kingdom is very valuable and beautiful, and gives happiness
\p
\v 44 “God’s kingdom can be compared with a treasure of very great value which had been hidden by a person in a field for a long time, and was forgotten. One day, another person found that treasure. He buried it again with great joy, and then went to sell everything he owned so that he could buy that field.
\p
\v 45 “God’s kingdom is also like a merchant looking for pearls\f + \fr 13:45 \fk pearl \ft is a gem stone that’s round in shape and is often white in color. Pearls come from a type of mussel or clam shell. They are formed because there’s some small object or sand that enters the body of the clam. Then it’s repeatedly covered by skin, until it becomes large and round.\f* that are very beautiful.
\v 46 When he finds a pearl whose beauty is truly unusual, he goes to sell all of his possessions and then buys that pearl.”
\s1 The parable of a fish net
\p
\v 47 “God’s kingdom is also like a fish net that’s lowered into a lake and then catches all kinds of fish.
\v 48 After the net is full of fish, the fishermen pull the net to land. Then they sit down and separate the fish. The good fish are put into a basket, but the bad ones are thrown away.
\v 49 The same thing will happen at the end of the age. The angels will come to separate the evil people from the righteous people.
\v 50 Then the evil people will be thrown into hell’s fire. They’ll always be crying there because they suffer severely.
\p
\v 51 Jesus asked us, “Do you understand the meaning of all that?” And we answered, “We understand, Teacher.”
\p
\v 52 Then He spoke again, “So because you understand all of those things, you’ll understand this too. Each of you who becomes a teacher of Gods’ kingdom teachings should be like a wise home owner. A person like that understands how to use all the treasures he has stored, both new and old.”
\s1 Jesus is rejected in His own village (Mark 6:1-6; Luke 4:16-30)
\p
\v 53 After Jesus finished telling all of that, He left with us.
\v 54 When He arrived in the village where He grew up, He was invited to teach in their synagogue. The residents of the village were really amazed when they heard His teaching. But they said to each other, “He’s very daring to teach us, isn’t he! Where did he get this knowledge and the authority to do miracles?
\v 55 He’s just the son of that carpenter. His mother is Mary, and his younger brothers are James, Joseph, Simon and Judas.
\v 56 And all of his younger sisters are still here with us. Why does he think he can teach us?!”
\v 57 So because they knew Him, they didn’t want to believe in Him.
\p Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is always respected everywhere, except in the place he came from and among his own family.”
\p
\v 58 So He didn’t do many miracles there because they didn’t believe in Him.
