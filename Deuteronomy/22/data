\c 22
\s1 Other rules
\p
\v 1 "When you see a cow or a sheep owned by your fellowman gone astray, don't pretend you don't know, but bring that animal back to your fellowman.
\v 2 If your fellowman doesn't live near your house or if you don't know the owner, bring that animal home to your house and raise it until the owner comes to find it. Then return that animal to him.
\v 3 Do like that also with donkeys, clothing and whatever possessions of your fellowman that you find. Don't pretend not to know.
\p
\v 4 "When you see a donkey or cow that is ridden by your fellowman fallen on the road because the load is too heavy, don't pretend not to know, but help your fellowman so that his animal can stand again.
\p
\v 5 "Women may not wear men's clothing, and also the reverse men may not wear women's clothing. The LORD your God really hates whoever does that.
\p
\v 6 "When you meet a bird's nest in the tree or on the ground and the mother is with her young or is incubating her eggs, don't take that mother bird.
\v 7 You may take the young birds, but let the mother bird fly. In that way the LORD will bless you and give you a long life.
\p
\v 8 "If you build a new house, then you must attach a fence around the top of that house. Because when there is no fence there and a person falls from the top and dies, then you will be responsible for that death.
\p
\v 9 "Don't plant other plants in your vineyard other than grapes. If you do that, then all of your harvest produce from both of them won't be useful. \f + \fr 22:9-12 \fk the reason for the four commands\ft Moses didn't give reasons for these four commands, but one of the reasons is that these things symbolize the purity that God wants for His people. God also didn't want the nation of Israel to live or have customs like other nations.\f*
\p
\v 10 "When you plow a field, don't pair a cow with a donkey on one plow.
\p
\v 11 "Don't wear clothing that is woven from a mix of wool with linen.
\p
\v 12 "Make fringes on the four corners of your outer robe."
\s1 Rules regarding marriage
\p
\v 13 Suppose a man marries a woman and has sex with her as normal for a husband and wife, but then the man doesn't want her any more.
\v 14 If that man accuses his wife by saying that she had sex with another man before they were married,
\v 15 then the parents of the woman must bring the marriage cloth that has her blood stains which prove that their child at the time of marriage by that man was still a virgin. They must show that cloth to the leaders of the city in the court.
\v 16 The father of the woman must say to them, 'I have given my child to this man to become his wife, but now he doesn't want her any more.
\v 17 He accused my child by saying that my child was not a virgin when they married. But this is the proof that my child at that time was still a virgin. Look, this is the cloth on top of the bed with blood stains from the first night of their marriage!'
\v 18 Then the leaders of that city in the court must call the man and punish him.
\v 19 That man must pay a fine as much as one hundred silver money coins and give them to the father of that woman, because the man has defiled the good name of that woman of Israel. That woman must remain as his wife, and her husband may not divorce her as long as the man lives.
\p
\v 20 "But if the accusation is true and there is no proof that can be gotten to show the virginity of that woman when they married,
\v 21 then the leaders must bring that woman to the front door of her father's house. Then all of the male citizens of that city must stone her with stones until dead. Because she has done a deed that is very shameful. She has committed adultery before marriage, while she was still living in her father's house. By punishing that woman, you all eradicate evil like that from among your nation.
\p
\v 22 "If a man is caught red-handed, while having sex with the wife of another man, then the two of them must be sentenced to die. In that way you all have eradicated evil from among your nation.
\p
\v 23 "If in one city there is a man caught red-handed while having sex with a woman who is engaged to another person,
\p
\v 24 then you all must bring the two of them outside of the city and stone them with stones until dead. That woman must be killed because she was in the city and didn't scream asking for help, where the sound of her scream could be heard. And that man must be killed because he had sex with a woman who was engaged. In that way you have eradicated evil like that from among your nation.
\p
\v 25 "If a man rapes a woman who is engaged with another person and that happens outside of the city, then only the man must be sentenced to die.
\v 26 Don't do anything to that woman, because that woman didn't sin worthy of the death sentence. This case is the same as the case of a person who surrenders his fellowman to be killed.
\v 27 Because the rape happened outside of the city, even though the woman screamed asking for help, yet there was no one that came to help her.
\p
\v 28 "If a man is found raping a woman who is still a virgin and before engagement,
\v 29 then that man must pay the bride price of fifty silver money coins to that woman's father. That woman must become his wife and may not divorce him as long as she lives, because that man had forced that woman to have sex with him.
\p
\v 30 "A man may not insult his father by having sex with his father's wife."
