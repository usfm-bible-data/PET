\s1 Other regulations
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the Israelites, “If you see a cow or sheep belonging to your neighbor straying, don't pretend to not know. Bring the animal back to its owner.\x + \xo 22:1 \xt Ex. 23:4\x*
\v 2 If the animal does not belong to the people around you, or if you don't know who owns it, bring the animal to your house and keep it until the owner comes looking for it. Then return the animal to him.
\v 3 Do the same if you find donkeys, clothes, or anything else belonging to someone else. Don't pretend to not know.
\p
\v 4 “If you see a donkey or cow belonging to your neighbor lying on the road because the load is too heavy, don't pretend to not know. Help him to get the animal back up.\x + \xo 22:4 \xt Ex. 23:5\x*
\p
\v 5 “Women are not allowed to wear men's clothes, and conversely, men may not wear women's clothes. The LORD your God hates anyone who does this very much.
\p
\v 6 "If you find a bird's nest in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is with her chicks or is incubating her eggs, do not take the mother bird.
\v 7 You may take the eggs or chicks, but let the mother fly away. In this way the LORD will make you prosperous and give you a long life.
\p
\v 8 "If you build a new house, you must put a fence around the roof of the house, because if there is no fence there and someone falls from the roof and dies, then you are responsible for his death.
\p
\v 9 “Do not plant any other plant in your vineyard other than the grapevine. If you violate this rule, then the whole harvest from both of them may not be used.\f + \fr 22:9-12 \fk reasons for the four commandments \ft Moses gave no reason for the four commandments in verses 9-12, but one of the reasons is that it represents the purity that God wills for His people. God also wanted the Israelites not to follow the ways of life or customs of other nations.\f*
\p
\v 10 “When you plow a field, don't pair a cow with a donkey on a plow.
\p
\v 11 “Do not wear clothing woven from a mixture of wool and linen.
\p
\v 12 "Make tassels on the four ends of your robe."
\s1 Regulations concerning marriage
\p
\v 13 One day something like this might happen: a man marries a woman, but after having sex with her one time, doesn't like her anymore.
\v 14 Then the husband accuses his wife of having had sex with another man before they married.
\v 15 If the woman's parents feel that the accusation is false, they should take the bridal cloth\f + \fr 22:15 \fk the bridal cloth \ft the cloth in question is the base of the bridal bed, see explanation on v.17\f* that has traces of blood as evidence that their child was still a virgin when he married her. They must show the cloth to the assembly of city leaders.
\v 16 The woman's father will say to them, 'I gave my child to this man to be his wife, but now he hates her.
\v 17 He accused my daughter of not being a virgin when they got married. But this is proof that my child was still a virgin at that time. Look, this is the bedspread with the blood stain from their wedding night!'
\v 18-19 Then the city leaders will call the man, who has defamed an Israelite woman. They will beat him,\f + \fr 22:18 \fk hit him \ft Most likely the beating was done with a stick like rattan, compare Prov. 10:13; 19:29; and 26:3. It is interesting to note that there were no rattan plants in the land of Canaan.\f* and he also had to pay a fine of 1,200 grams of silver to his in-laws. In addition, the congregation will also determine that the woman will remain as his wife. Her husband must not divorce her all her life.
\p
\v 20 “But if the allegations are true and there is no evidence to suggest that the women were virgins when they married,
\v 21 then the leaders had to bring the woman to the door of her father's house. Then all the men of the town had to stone him to death, because he had committed a very shameful act in Israel, namely adultery before marriage while still living in his father's house. By punishing that woman, you are eradicating a similar crime from among our people.
\p
\v 22 “If a man is caught having sex with someone else's wife, then both of them must be put to death. In this way you eradicate evil from among our nations.
\p
\v 23 "If in a city there is a man caught having sex with a woman who is engaged to someone else,
\p
\v 24 then you must take them both outside the city and stone them to death. The woman had to be killed because she was in the city and was not screaming for help, even though her screams could be heard. The man had to be killed because he had defiled someone else's fiancé. In this way, you eradicate evil from among our nations.
\p
\v 25 "But if a man rapes a woman who is engaged to another person and the incident occurs outside the city, then only that man should be put to death.
\v 26-27 Do not punish the woman, because she has not committed a sin that is worth the death penalty. The rape took place outside the city, so even though the woman was screaming for help, no one could hear it. So, this case is the same as a murder case which is carried out without an eye witness.
\p
\v 28 "If a man is caught raping a girl who is not engaged,
\v 29 then the man has to pay the dowry of 600 grams of silver to the woman's father. That woman must be his wife and cannot be divorced for life, because the man has forced the woman to have intercourse with him.
\p
\v 30 "If a man has several wives and sons and he dies, his son may not marry the widow of his father, because that is the same as insulting his father."\f + \fr 22:30 \fk Commentary \ft In Hebrew this verse is not the same as Lev. 20:11 and Deut. 27:20. Both verses forbid a son to "sleep with his father's wife" (not his own mother, but another wife of his father), and that could happen while the father was alive. Whereas in this verse, a son 'takes his father's wife', means to marry, and it must have happened after his father died.\f*
