\s Advice to keep being obedient to the LORD
\p
\v 1 “O people of Israel, obey all the statutes and rules that I am teaching you now, so the LORD— who is the God of our ancestors— will allow you to continue to live and enter the land that He has perpared for you.
\v 2 “Do not add or substract from what I am commanding you today. Obey all of it, because what I command you is the commands of the LORD our God.
\v 3 “You have seen with your own eyes what has been done by the LORD our God in the Mount of Peor. Each person among us that worships the Baal god is destroyed by Him,
\v 4 but all of you who stay faithful to the LORD are still alive until today.
\v 5 “Pay attention: I have already taught you all the statutes and rules according to what the LORD my God has commanded me. Do all of them in the land that you will enter and reign.
\v 6 Obey all of them wholeheatedly, because then you will become wise and understanding in the eyes of nations. When they hear all these statutes, they will be amazed and say, “How wise and understanding this big nation is!’
\v 7 Because there are no other nation— regardless of how big that nation is— whose god is ready to answer their prayers when they need help, as how the LORD our God always answers our prayers every time we ask for help.
\v 8 And there are no other nation— regardless of how big that nation is— that has statutes and rules that are so just like what I am teaching to you today.
\v 9 “But each of you must guard yourselves well so that you don’t forget what you have seen in the past. Keep all of those experiences in your heart well, and tell them to your children and grandchildren repeatedly.
\v 10 Tell to them about the day when you \f + \fr 4:10 \fk you 
\ft When Moses told about this, among the elderly men, only Joshua and Caleb can remember this event. There is a possibility that there are more women who can remember this event. (Deu. 1:34-36, 2:14-15)\f*stand before the LORD our God in the Mount of Sinai. At that time the LORD said to me, ‘Gather all these people to listen to mya commands. In that way they will learn to fear and respect Me as long as they live, and they will also teach their children to fear and respect Me.’
\v 11 Then you drew near and stood at the feet of that mountain, which is being covered with blazing fire up to the sky. The black smoke is like cloud covering the sky.
\v 12 Then the LORD spoke to us from the midst of that fire. You can only hear His voice, but not see His form.
\v 13 He conveyed to us the conditions that we have to do so that the covenant that He made with us is kept. Those conditions are His Ten Commandments, which He wrote on the two tablets of stone.
\v 14 And at that time the LORD told me to teach to you the statutes and rules so that you will do them in the land that you will enter and own.”
\s Do not worship gods
\p
\v 15 “Remember carefully! When the LORD spoke to us from inside the fire in the Mount of Sinai,\f + \fr 4:15 \fk Mount Sinai \ft Literally, ‘Mount Horeb’.\f* we did not see His form.
\v 16 So do not corrupt yourself by making idol statues for you to worship. Making idols is forbidden regardless of whatever form it is— whether in the form of male or female,
\q1
\v 17 or in the form of animals that live on land, birds that fly in the sky,
\q1
\v 18 animals that creep over the ground, or fish that are in the deepest parts of the sea.\f \fr 4:18 \fk fish that are in … \ft Literally, ‘fish that are in the water under the earth’. This can be intepreted according to the understanding during the time of the writer, who believe that the earth is a group of land located above a large sea. So there is a possibility that Moses means the fish that are in the large sea that are under the earth. Or the meaning can also be more broad like translated in the TSI text. See NET, NIV, and NLT.\f*
\m
\v 19 And when you look to the sky and see the sun, moon, stars— all that is in the sky— don’t be tempted to worship those things. The LORD God has let all the other nations of the world worship those, but you may not do that!
\v 20 Always remember that the LORD has brought us out of Egypt, where we suffered as if we were in the heat of a furnace. He did that so that we are set apart by Him as a nation owned by Him as how we are now.
\p
\v 21 “ But the LORD our God was at one point angry towards me because of you, and He decided that I may not cross the Jordan River to enter the fertile land, which He is giving to you.
\v 22 Not much longer you will cross the Jordan River and occupy that fertile land. But I will not go with you, because I will die here.
\p
\v 23
\v 24 Because the LORD our God is a jealous \f + \fr 4:24 \fk jealous \ft Yang dimaksud dengan cemburu di sini bukan sifat cemburu yang negatif seperti dalam manusia, melainkan sifat yang digerakkan Allah oleh kasih-Nya.\f* God and His anger is like fire that consumes.
\v 25 So after you live long in the land of Canaan and already have children and grandchildren, let there be no one among you who sins by making idol statues in any shape. That is a big wickedness in the LORD’s eyes, and will make the LORD angry.
\p
\v 26 “Let the sky and earth today be witnesses that if you worship idols, then you will surely soon perish from the land that you will enter across the Jordan River. You will not stay there for long, but you will surely perish.
\v 27 Most of you will die. Then the LORD will scatter the few that still remains to other lands.
\v 28 There you will worship gods made by human hands from wood and stone, who cannot see, hear, and smell.
\v 29 But there you will look for the LORD your God again. And if you strive to look for Him wholeheartedly,\f + \fr 4:29 \fk wholeheartedly \ft Literally, ‘with your whole heart and with your whole soul’. In Indonesian, ‘with your whole heart’ includes one’s whole being, and Indonesians don’t talk about doing something with soul.\f* you will find Him.
\v 30 When you are in difficulty and all those disasters fall on you, you will return to the LORD and be obedient to Him.
\p
\v 31 “Because the LORD our God is a loving God. He will not leave or destroy you, because He will not forget His covenant, which he vowed to our ancestors.”
\s Only one God
\p
\v 32 “Please find out in the history of the whole world! Since God created the first human up to your generation, has there been a great incident like what we have already experienced?! Definitely not!
\v 33 Is there even one nation that has heard the voice of their gods talk to them? — like we hear the sound of God from the midst of the fire. And it is already amazing that we did not die instantly when we heard the voice of God!
\v 34 Or compare the various doings of God with the doings of gods. Has there meen a god that tried to bring a whole nation out from other nation like what the LORD our Goddid for us in Egypt? With your own eyes you have seen how with His big and scary power the LORD did all kinds of miraculous signs by giving various punishments on the Egyptian people, including war.
\p
\v 35 The LORD showed those things to us so that we know that there is only one God— that is the LORD.
\v 36 He let us hear His voice from the sky to teach us. And when still alive in this earth He let us see His really large fire, and we hear his words from the midst of that fire.
\v 37 Because the LORD loves our ancestors, He chose us— their descendants— and be with us until He brought us out of Egypt with His large power.
\v 38 He drove out nations larger and stronger than us to bring us to their nation and so that that nation will become ours and an inheritance to our descendants, as what has been starting to be realized today.
\p
\v 39 “Know and decide in each of youer hearts today that from under the eart and up to the highest levels of heavens above, there is only one God— that is the LORD. there is no other god.
\v 40 So obey the whole law and rules that I teach you today, so that you and your descendants will always live prosperously, and so that you may stay long in the land that the LORD is giving to us— even until forever.”
\s [Three refuge cities// About three refuge cities on the east side of Jordan River]
\p
\v 41 Then Moses chose three cities from the cities that are on the east side of Jordan River as place for protection.
\v 42 Meaning, if someone accidentally kills another person who previously is not his enemy, he can run away to one of those three cities. In that way the peson who accidentally killed another person won’t be killed by the family of the deceased person before the murder case is put on trial.
\v 43 The three cities chosen by Moses are the City of Bezer in the wilderness for the tribe of Reuben, City of Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad, and City of Golan in Basan for the tribe of Manasseh.
\s Introduction to Moses’ second sermon
\p
\v 44-45 The following are laws, rules, statutes, and rules that Moses teach to the Israelites after they come out of Egypt
\v 46 and camp in the east side of Jordan River near the City of Bet-Peor. That territory is previously ruled by Sihon, king of the Amorites that rule from the City of Heshbon. But when Israel reached there, Moses led the Israelite troops to destroy them.
\v 47 Israel captured the land of Sihon and also the land of King Og who reign from the City of Basan. So Moses defeated two Amorite kingdoms on the east side of the Jordan River.
\v 48 The area of the two kingdoms is vast. The borders on the south side start from the City of Aroer and traces the gorge valley of Arnon River. The borders on the north side is Mount of Sirion, which is also called Mount of Hermon.
\v 49 That area also covers the whole of east side from the Jordan Valley River, until the south side of the Dead Sea, and to the east until the mountainside of Mount of Pisga.
