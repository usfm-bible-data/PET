\s Advice to obey God
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught, "O people of Israel, obey all the rules and regulations that I teach you now, so that the LORD God of our fathers will allow you to live, enter, and possess the land which He will soon hand over to be yours.
\v 2 Do not add to what I command, and do not subtract either. Obey all of it, for what I am telling you are the commandments of the LORD our God.
\p
\v 3 “You have seen with your own eyes what the LORD did on Mount Peor. Every one of us who worshiped the god Baal was destroyed by Him!
\v 4 But all of you who have been faithful to the LORD are still alive to this day.
\p
\v 5 "Pay attention, I am reiterating the provisions and regulations that the LORD commanded me to convey to you, so that you obey all of these in the land that you will enter and control.
\v 6 Obey all these things earnestly, for in this way you will be wise and understanding in the eyes of the Gentiles. When they hear all these decrees, they will be amazed and say, 'How wise and understanding this great nation is!'
\v 7 For there is no other nation, no matter how big the nation may be, whose gods can answer their prayers when they need help, just as the LORD our God always answers our prayers whenever we ask for help.
\v 8 And no other nation, however big that nation may be, has rules and regulations as just as the ones I teach you today.
\p
\v 9 "But each of you must guard yourself so that you do not forget what you have witnessed in the past. Keep well all these experiences in your heart, and tell them over and over again to your children and grandchildren.
\v 10 Tell them about the day you\f + \fr 4:10 \fk you \ft At the time Moses told this story, among the elderly men, only Joshua and Caleb knew about this incident. There were probably more women who could remember this event (Deut. 1:34-36, 2:14-15).\f* stood before the LORD our God at Mount Sinai. At that time, the LORD said to me, 'Gather all these people to hear my commandments. In this way they will learn to fear and respect Me as long as they live, and they will also teach their children to fear and respect Me.'
\v 11 Then you came and stood at the foot of the mountain, which was being engulfed by fire burning up to heaven. Its black smoke covered the sky like a cloud.
\v 12 Then the LORD spoke to us from the midst of the fire. You could only hear His voice, but not see His form.
\v 13 He told us the conditions that we must meet so that the covenant He made with us is kept. Those conditions were His Ten Commandments, which He wrote on two stone tablets.
\v 14 And at that time, the LORD commanded me to teach you the rules and regulations so that you would do them in the land which you shall enter and possess."
\s Do not worship a god
\p
\v 15 Moses continued his admonition, "Remember well! When the LORD spoke to us from the fire on Mount Sinai,\f + \fr 4:15 \fk Mount Sinai \ft Literally, 'Mount Horeb'. See notes in Exod. 3:1.\f* we did not see His form.
\v 16 So do not sin by making idols for you to worship. Idol-making is prohibited in any form,
\q1 both in male and female form,
\q1
\v 17 or in the form of animals living on land,
\q1 birds flying through the air,
\q1
\v 18 beasts crawling on the ground,
\q1 or fish that are in the water.\f + \fr 4:18 \fk fish that are... \ft Literally, 'fish that are in the water under the earth'. This can be interpreted according to the understanding of the writer's time, which believed that the earth was a collection of land that lay on top of a large ocean. So it is possible that Moses meant the fish that were in the great ocean under the earth. Or the meaning can be more general as translated in the TSI text.\f*
\m
\v 19 Also do not be tempted to worship the sun, moon, and stars in the sky. The LORD our God has allowed all other nations to worship these things,\x + \xo 4:19 \xt Acts. 17:30\x* but you cannot!
\v 20 Always remember that the LORD brought us out of Egypt, where we suffered as if we were in the heat of a furnace. He did that to set us apart as His people, the way we are today.
\p
\v 21 "But the LORD our God was angry with me because of you, and He decided that I would not be allowed to cross the Jordan River to enter the fertile land that He will soon hand over to you. The LORD even confirmed that decision with an oath.
\v 22 So I'm going to die here. Meanwhile you will soon cross the Jordan River and occupy that fertile land.
\p
\v 23 “Be careful that you do not forget the covenant that the LORD God has made with us. Do not break His commandments by making idols of any kind.
\v 24 For the LORD is a jealous God,\f + \fr 4:24 \fk jealous \ft What is meant by 'jealousy' here is not a negative jealousy like that in humans, but an attribute that is moved by God through his love.\f* and His anger is like a consuming fire.
\v 25 So after you have lived a long time in the land of Canaan and have had many children, let there be none from among you who sin by making an image of worship in any form. It is a great evil in the eyes of the LORD, and it will anger him.
\p
\v 26 "Let the heavens and the earth bear witness today that if you worship idols, you will soon be eliminated. You will not live long in the land you will occupy on the other side of the Jordan River, because you will be finished off.
\v 27 Most of you will die. Then the LORD will scatter the few that are left to other lands.
\v 28 There you will worship gods of wood and stone made by human hands, who cannot see, hear, eat, and smell.
\v 29 But if when you are there you strive to return to the LORD our God, and if you earnestly seek Him with all your heart,\f + \fr 4:29 \fk earnestly... \ft Literally, 'with all your heart and with all your soul'. In Indonesian, a person cannot tell his soul to do something. The concept of "all soul" is translated here as "earnestly", and is assumed to include "all heart."\f* you will find Him.
\p
\v 30 “In the future, when you experience all of these troubles and calamities, you will return to the LORD and be obedient to Him.
\v 31 The LORD is a Merciful God. He will not leave you or destroy you, because He will not forget His promise that He confirmed to our ancestors."
\s Only one God
\p
\v 32 “Try to find out if anything we have experienced has ever happened in the history of this whole world! Since God created the first human being to our generation, surely no nation has ever experienced awesome events like the ones we have experienced!
\v 33 Has any nation ever heard the voice of their god speak to them? - as we heard the voice of God from the midst of the fire. And how extraordinary it was that we didn't die immediately when we heard God's voice!
\v 34 Or compare the deeds of God with those of the gods. Has there ever been a god who tried to bring a nation out of another land like the LORD God did for us in Egypt? With your own eyes, you have seen how the LORD, with His great and terrifying power, imposed various punishments on the people of Egypt. Indeed He performed various [** miracles // miraculous signs] and saved us from their army.
\p
\v 35 “The LORD showed you these things so that you would know that there is only one God, the LORD.
\v 36 He made you hear His voice from heaven to teach you. And in this world, He allowed you to see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire.
\v 37 Because the LORD loved our ancestors, He chose their offspring, namely us, and was with us, until he brought us out of Egypt by means of his great power.
\v 38 He drove out nations that were greater and stronger than us to bring us to their land, so that the land would be ours and an inheritance for our descendants, as has begun to be realized today.
\p
\v 39 “Know and be assured in each of your hearts that in all the earth to the highest level of heaven, there is only one God, namely the LORD. There is no god worthy of worship!
\v 40 So obey all the laws and regulations of the LORD that I teach you today, so that you and your descendants may always live in prosperity, and that you may remain in the land that the LORD will soon give to us, even for forever."
\s Three cities of refuge east of the Jordan River
\p
\v 41 Then Moses appointed three of the cities that were on the east side of the Jordan River as cities of refuge.
\v 42 The goal was that if someone accidentally killed another person, not out of hostility, he could escape to one of the three cities. Thus, a person who accidentally killed another person would not be sentenced to death by the victim's family before the case was tried.\x + \xo 4:42 \xt Deut. 19:1-13\x*
\v 43 Moses chose three cities as the nearest places of refuge for each tribe,
\li2 the city of Bezer in the wilderness on the highlands, for the tribe of Reuben,
\li2 the city of Ramoth in Gilead, for the tribe of Gad,
\li2 and the city of Golan in Bashan, for the tribe of Manasseh.
\s Preface to Moses' second sermon
\p
\v 44-46 The following are the various laws, provisions, and regulations that Moses taught the Israelites after they left Egypt and camped on the east side of the Jordan River, near the city of Beth Peor. The area was previously ruled by Sihon, king of the Amorites who ruled from the city of Hesbon. But when the Israelites got there, Moses led the Israelite soldiers to destroy Sihon and his people.
\v 47 Israel captured the land of Sihon as well as the land of King Og who ruled from the city of Bashan. So, at this time the Israelites had already occupied the territory of the two kingdoms of the Amorites east of the Jordan River.
\v 48 The territory of the two kingdoms was vast. Its southern border began at the city of Aroer and followed the Arnon River valley ravine. Its border to the north was Mount Sirion, which is also called Mount Hermon.
\v 49 This region also covered the entire eastern portion of the Jordan River Valley, to the southern end of the Dead Sea, and east to the slopes of Mount Pisgah.
