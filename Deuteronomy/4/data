\s Advice to keep obeying the LORD
\p
\v 1 “O people of Israel, obey all of the statutes and rules that I am teaching you now, so that the LORD— who is the God of our ancestors— will allow you to continue to live and enter the land that He has prepared for you.
\v 2 “Do not add or substract from what I am commanding you today. Obey all of it, because what I command you are the commands of the LORD our God.
\v 3 “You have witnessed with your own eyes what has been done by the LORD our God on Mount Peor. Each person among us that worshiped the god Baal god was destroyed by Him,
\v 4 but all of you who remained faithful to the LORD\f + \fr 4:4 \fk LORD \ft Literally, 'the LORD our/your God'. The TSI shortened it to avoid repitition.\f* are still alive to this day.
\v 5 “Pay attention: I have already taught you all of the statutes and rules according to what the LORD my God commanded me. Do all of them in the land that you will enter and rule.
\v 6 Obey all of them wholeheatedly, because in that way you will become wise and have understanding in the eyes of nations. When they hear all of these statutes, they will be amazed and say, “How wise and understanding this great nation is!’
\v 7 Because there are no other nation— regardless of how great that nation is— whose god is ready to answer their prayers when they need help, as the LORD our God always answers our prayers every time we ask for help.
\v 8 And there is no other nation— regardless of how great that nation is— that has statutes and rules that are so just like what I am teaching to you today.
\v 9 “But each of you must guard yourselves well so that you don’t forget what you have witnessed in the past. Keep all of those experiences in your heart well, and tell them to your children and grandchildren repeatedly.
\v 10 Tell them about the day when you\f + \fr 4:10 \fk you \ft When Moses told this, among the elderly men, only Joshua and Caleb could remember this event. It is probable that more women were there who could remember this event. (Deu. 1:34-36, 2:14-15)\f* stood before the LORD our God at Mount Sinai. At that time the LORD said to me, ‘Gather all of these people to listen to My commands. In that way they will learn to fear and respect Me as long as they live, and they will also teach their children to fear and respect Me.’
\v 11 Then you drew near and stood at the foot of that mountain, which was being covered with fire that blazed up to the sky. The black smoke was like a cloud covering the sky.
\v 12 Then the LORD spoke to us from the midst of that fire. You could only hear His voice, but did not see His form.
\v 13 He conveyed to us the conditions that we have to do so that the covenant that He made with us is protected. Those conditions are His Ten Commandments, which He wrote on the two stone tablets.
\v 14 And at that time the LORD told me to teach you the statutes and rules so that you will do them in the land that you will enter and possess.”
\s Do not worship gods
\p
\v 15 “Remember carefully! When the LORD spoke to us from inside the fire at Mount Sinai,\f + \fr 4:15 \fk Mount Sinai \ft Literally, ‘Mount Horeb’.\f* we did not see His form.
\v 16 So do not corrupt yourself by making idol statues for you to worship. Making idols is forbidden in any form at all— whether in the form of male or female,
\q1
\v 17 or in the form of animals that live on land, birds that fly in the sky,
\q1
\v 18 animals that creep on top of the ground, or fish that are in the deepest part of the sea.\f \fr 4:18 \fk fish that are in … \ft Literally, ‘fish that are in the water under the earth’. This can be intepreted according to the understanding during the time of the writer, who believed that the earth was a collection of land located on top of a large sea. So there is a possibility that Moses meant the fish that are in the large sea that is under the earth. Or the meaning can also be more general like it is translated in the TSI text. See NET, NIV, and NLT.\f*
\m
\v 19 And when you view the sky and see the sun, moon, stars— all that is in the sky— don’t be tempted to worship those things. The LORD our God has let all the other nations of the world worship those, but you may not do that!
\v 20 Always remember that the LORD has brought us out of Egypt, where we suffered as if we were in the heat of a furnace. He did that so that we are set apart by Him as a nation possessed by Him just as we are now.
\p
\v 21 “ But the LORD our God was at one point angry towards me because of you, and He decided that I may not cross the Jordan River to enter the fertile land, which He is giving to you.
\v 22 Not much longer you will cross the Jordan River and occupy that fertile land. But I will not go with you, because I will die here.
\p
\v 23 “Be careful that you do not forget the covenant that the LORD God has made with us. Do not disobey His commands by making idols of any form at al.
\v 24 Because the LORD our God is a jealous\f + \fr 4:24 \fk jealous \ft What is intended by ‘jealous’ here is not negative like in humans, but is an attitude which is stirred up in God because of His love.\f* God and His anger is like a fire that burns.
\v 25 So after you live long in the land of Canaan and already have children and grandchildren, don't let any one among you sin by making idol statues in any form. That would be great wickedness in the LORD’s eyes, and would make the LORD angry.
\p
\v 26 “Let the sky and earth today be witnesses that if you worship idols, then you will surely perish quickly from the land that you will enter across the Jordan River. You will not stay there for long, but you will surely be destroyed.
\v 27 Most of you will die. Then the LORD will scatter the few that still remain to other lands.
\v 28 There you will worship gods made by human hands from wood and stone, who cannot see, hear, eat and smell.
\v 29 But there you will look for the LORD your God again. And if you endeavor to look for Him with your whole heart\f + \fr 4:29 \fk whole heart \ft Literally, ‘with your whole heart and with your whole soul’. In Indonesian, ‘with your whole heart’ includes one’s whole personality, and Indonesians don’t talk about doing something with their soul.\f* you will find Him.
\v 30 In the latter days, when you are experiencing trouble and all of those disasters fall on you, you will return to the LORD and be obedient to Him.
\p
\v 31 “Because the LORD our God is a God of Mercy. He will not leave or destroy you, because He will not forget His covenant which He swore to our ancestors.”
\s Only one God
\p
\v 32 “Please try to find in the history of the whole world! Since God created the first human until your generation, where has an awesome incident happened like what we have already experienced?! There certainly has not been!
\v 33 Is there even one nation that has heard the voice of their gods talk to them?— like we heard the voice of God from the midst of the fire. And it is already amazing that we did not die instantly when we heard the voice of God!
\v 34 Or compare the various actions of God with the actions of gods. Has there ever been an idol that endeavered to bring a whole nation out from other nation like what the LORD our God did for us in Egypt? With your own eyes you have winessed how with His great and fiersome power the LORD did all kinds of miraculous signs by sending various judgments on the Egyptian people, including war.
\p
\v 35 The LORD showed those things to us, so that we know that there is only one God— who is the LORD.
\v 36 He let us hear His voice from the sky to teach us. And while still on this earth He let us see His really great fire, and we heard His words from the midst of that fire.
\v 37 Because the LORD loved our ancestors, He chose us— their descendants— and was with us until He brought us out of Egypt with His great power.
\v 38 He drove out nations larger and stronger than us to bring us to their nations, so that those nations will become our possession and an inheritance for our descendants, like what is starting to happen today.
\p
\v 39 “Know and decide in each of your hearts that from beneath the earth and up to the highest level of heavens above, there is only one God— who is the LORD. There is no other god.
\v 40 So obey the whole law and the rules that I'm teaching you today, so that you and your descendants will always live prosperously, and so that you may remain long in the land that the LORD is giving to us— even forever.”
\s Three protection cities on the east side of the Jordan River
\p
\v 41 Then Moses chose three cities from the cities on the east side of the Jordan River as places for protection.
\v 42 The purpose being, if someone accidentally killed another person who previously was not his enemy, he could run away to one of those three cities. In that way the person who accidentally killed another person wouldn’t be killed by the family of the deceased person before the murder case was tried.
\v 43 The three cities chosen by Moses were the City of Bezer in the wilderness for the tribe of Reuben, the City of Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad, and the City of Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh.
\s Introduction to Moses’ second sermon
\p
\v 44-45 The following are the laws, statutes, and regulations that Moses taught to the Israelites after they came out of Egypt
\v 46 and camped in the east side of the Jordan River near the City of Beth-Peor. That territory was previously ruled by Sihon, king of the Amorites who ruled from the City of Heshbon. But when Israel got there, Moses led the soldiers of Israel to destroy them.
\v 47 Israel captured the land of Sihon and also the land of King Og who reigned from the City of Bashan. So Moses defeated the two Amorite nations' kingdoms on the east side of the Jordan River.
\v 48 The area of the two kingdoms was vast. The border on the south side started from the City of Aroer and traced the gorge of the valley of the Arnon River. The border on the north side was Mount Sirion, which was also called Mount Hermon.
\v 49 That area also covered the whole of the east side from the Jordan River Valley, up to the south side of the Dead Sea, and to the east up to the slope of Mount Pisgah.
