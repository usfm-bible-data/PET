\s Advice to keep being obedient to the LORD
\p
\v 1 “O people of Israel, obey all the statutes and rules that I am teaching you now, so that you will stay alive and can enter the land that has been provided by the LORD God worshipped by our ancestors for you.
\v 2 “Do not add or substract from what I am commanding you today. Obey all of it, because what I command you is the commands of the LORD our God.
\v 3 “You have seen with your own eyes what has been done by the LORD our God in the Mount of Peor. Each person among us that worships the Baal god is destroyed by Him,
\v 4 but all of you who stay faithful to the LORD are still alive until today.
\v 5 “Pay attention: I have already taught you all the statutes and rules according to what the LORD my God has commanded me. Do all of them in the land that you will enter and reign.
\v 6 Obey all of them wholeheatedly, because then you will become wise and understanding in the eyes of nations. When they hear all these statutes, they will be amazed and say, “How wise and understanding this big nation is!’
\v 7 Because there are no other nation— regardless of how big that nation is— whose god is ready to answer their prayers when they need help, as how the LORD our God always answers our prayers every time we ask for help.
\v 8 And there are no other nation— regardless of how big that nation is— that has statutes and rules that are so just like what I am teaching to you today.
\v 9 “But each of you must guard yourselves well so that you don’t forget what you have seen in the past. Keep all of those experiences in your heart well, and tell them to your children and grandchildren repeatedly.
\v 10 Tell to them about the day when you stand before the LORD our God in the Mount of Sinai. At that time the LORD said to me, ‘Gather all these people to listen to mya commands. In that way they will learn to fear and respect Me as long as they live, and they will also teach their children to fear and respect Me.’
\v 11 Then you drew near and stood at the feet of that mountain, which is being covered with blazing fire up to the sky. The black smoke is like cloud covering the sky.
\v 12 Then the LORD spoke to us from the midst of that fire. You can only hear His voice, but not see His form.
\v 13 He conveyed to us the conditions that we have to do so that the covenant that He made with us is kept. Those conditions are His Ten Commandments, which He wrote on the two tablets of stone.
\v 14 And at that time the LORD told me to teach to you the statutes and rules so that you will do them in the land that you will enter and own.”
\s Do not worship gods
\p
\v 15 “Remember carefully! When the LORD spoke to us from inside the fire in the Mount of Sinai, we did not see His form.

\v 19 And when you look to the sky and see the sun, moon, stars— all that is in the sky— don’t be tempted to worship those things. The LORD God has let all other nations in this world to worship that, but you may not do that!
\v 20 Always remember that the LORD has brought us out of Egypt, where we suffered as if we were in the heat of a furnace. He did that so that we are set apart by Him as a nation owned by Him as how we are now.
\p
\v 21 “ But the LORD our God was at one point angry towards me because of you, and He decided that I may not cross the Jordan River to enter the fertile land, which He is giving to you.
\v 22 Not much longer you will cross the Jordan River and occupy that fertile land. But I will not go with you, because I will die here.
\p
\v 23
\v 24 Because the LORD our God is a jealous God and His anger is like fire that consumes.
\v 25 So after you live long in the land of Canaan and already have children and grandchildren, let there be no one among you who sins by making idol statues in any shape. That is a big wickedness in the LORD’s eyes, and will make the LORD angry.
\p
\v 26 “Let the sky and earth today be witnesses that if you worship idols, then you will surely soon perish from the land that you will enter across the Jordan River. You will not stay there for long, but you will surely perish.
\v 27 Most of you will die. Then the LORD will scatter the few that still remains to other lands.
\v 28 There you will worship gods made by human hands from wood and stone, who cannot see, hear, and smell.
