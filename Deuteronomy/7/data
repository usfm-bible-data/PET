\s1 Blessings for obeying the LORD’s commands
\p
\v 1 “When the LORD our God brough you to the land that you will soon enter and rule, He will drive away seven nations that are stronger and more numerous than you. Those seven nations are Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
\v 2 The LORD our God has handed them all over to you, so you must kill them all. Don’t make peace agreements with some of them, and don’t pity them.
\v 3 Don’t do mix marriages with them. Don’t hand over your daughters to marry with their sons. And don’t let your sons to marry their daughters.
\v 4 Because they will influence your sons to worship other gods. God will be very angry to you and immediately destroy you if you violate His law.
\v 5 This is what you must do to those nations: Destroy altars where they sacrifice animals. Destroy also the idol monuments and idol pillars that they use to worship the Asherah Goddess, and burn all their idol statues.
\v 6 You must destroy all those because we are a people made holy by the LORD and for Him
