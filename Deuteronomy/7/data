\s1 Blessings for obeying the LORD’s commands
\p
\v 1 “When the LORD our God brough you to the land that you will soon enter and rule, He will drive away seven nations that are stronger and more numerous than you. Those seven nations are Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
\v 2 The LORD our God has handed them all over to you, so you must kill them all. Don’t make peace agreements with some of them, and don’t pity them.
\v 3 Don’t do mix marriages with them. Don’t hand over your daughters to marry with their sons. And don’t let your sons to marry their daughters.
\v 4 Because they will influence your sons to worship other gods. God will be very angry to you and immediately destroy you if you violate His law.
\v 5 This is what you must do to those nations: Destroy altars where they sacrifice animals. Destroy also the idol monuments and idol pillars that they use to worship the Asherah Goddess, and burn all their idol statues.
\v 6 You must destroy all those because we are a people made holy by the LORD and for Him, and from among all other nations on earth, we have been chosen by the LORD our God to be His own special posession.
\p
\v 7 “The LORD love and choose us not because our numbers are more than the other nations, but in fact we are the least in number from all the other nations.
\v 8 The LORD love us and do what He has promised to our ancestors. That is why the LORD saves us from the power of the Egyptian king and with His mighty power brought us out of there.
\v 9 So, don’t forget that the LORD our God is the only God. He is God who can be trusted because He does what He promise to us, and He shows his kindness faithfully to everyone who love Him and obey His commands from generation to generation
\v 10 But He will punish by destroying people who hate Him. He does not delay from immediately revenging each person that hates Him.
\v 11 So, you must earnestly obey and do all commands— that is all commands and statutes that I give to you all today.
\p
\v 12 “If we hear these rules and do them faithfully, then the LORD our God will obey His official agreement with us and He will always love us, according to His promise to our ancestors.
\v 13 He will love and bless us, and make our numbers increase. He will bless us with many children, and bless our gardens and fields so that they give abundant wheat, grape, and olive oil harvests. He will also increase ouse cows and goats. He will give all these for us in the land that He promised to give to us by vowing to our ancestors.
\v 14 He will bless us more than other nations. No one among you and your descendants will be barren. As well as the livestocks you own.
\v 15 The LORD will also protect you from all diseases, so you do not suffer any scary diseases like what fell on the Egyptians. But every one who hate you will get that disease.
\p
\v 16 “In the process of conquering the land of Canaan, you must destroy all nations that the LORD God handed to you. Don’t pity them and don’t worship their gods. If you do that you already entered into a trap that destroys you.
\v 17 Don’t ever think, “The nations in this land is stronger than us, so how can we drive them away?”
\v 18 Don’t be afraid of them! Remember what
