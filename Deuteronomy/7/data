\s1 Blessings for obeying the LORD's commands
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, "When the LORD our God brings you into the land which you will soon enter and control, and He drives out seven nations who are stronger and more numerous than you, namely the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,
\v 2 and when the LORD hands over those nations to you, destroy them all without exception. Don't make a peace treaty with any of them, and don't be sorry for them.
\v 3 Do not have mixed marriages with them. Don't give your daughters to marry their sons. And do not let your sons marry their daughters,
\v 4 because the women will influence your sons to worship their gods. God will be very angry with you and will immediately destroy you if you violate His commandment\x + \xo 7:4 \xt Deut. 5:7 \x*.
\v 5 This is what you must do to these nations: Destroy the altars where they sacrifice animals. Also destroy the stone monuments of idols, cut down the wooden posts which are the symbol of the goddess Asherah, and burn all the statues of their gods.
\v 6 You must do this, because we are a people sanctified by the LORD for Him. From among all the other nations of the earth, we have been chosen by the LORD our God to be His own special possession.
\p
\v 7 "God loves us and chose us not because we are more numerous than other nations. In fact, we are the lowest in number compared to all other nations.
\v 8 But the LORD chose us because He loves us, and because He has kept His promise to our ancestors. That's why He used His mighty power to save us from the power of the king of Egypt and bring us out of bondage there.
\v 9 So, don't forget that the LORD is the only God. He is a God who is trustworthy, and He will be faithful to do what He promised us, even for thousands of generations, as long as we continue to love Him and obey His commandments.
\v 10 But He will punish those who hate Him by destroying them. He will not delay to repay them.
\v 11 So, you must pay attention to yourself to comply with all the commandments, rules and regulations that I am giving you today.
\p
\v 12 "If you always faithfully obey these rules, the LORD God will keep his covenant with you and will always love you, according to his promise to your ancestors.
\v 13 He will love and bless you, and multiply your number. He will bless you with many children and bless your gardens and fields so that they produce abundant grain, wine, and olive oil. He will also multiply your cows and sheep. The LORD will give these things to you in the land that He promised you by swearing to your ancestors.
\v 14 He will bless you more than any other nation. You and your descendants will not be barren, as well as your livestock.
\v 15 The LORD will also protect you from all sicknesses, so that you do not suffer terrible diseases like those that were inflicted upon the Egyptians. But He will punish your enemies with these diseases!
\p
\v 16 “When you take possession of the land of Canaan, you must destroy all the inhabitants that the LORD hands over to you. Don't have mercy on them, and don't worship their gods. If you do so, you will fall into a trap that will destroy you.
\v 17 Don't ever think, "The nations of this land are stronger than us, how can we possibly drive them out?"
\v 18 Don't be afraid of them! Remember what the LORD did to the king of Egypt and all his people.
\v 19 You have seen for yourself how the LORD used his mighty power to bring disasters and all kinds of wonders upon them, so that you may be freed from that land. He will do the same to the people you now fear.
\v 20 Indeed, the LORD will give them a feeling of panic,\f + \fr 7:20 \fk give them a feeling of panic \ft The meaning of the Hebrew word translated as 'panic' is uncertain. Some people translate it as 'wasp', or another animal that can sting. If that is the meaning, then the animal can be considered a metaphor for a feeling of panic.\f* so that many of them will run away from your presence. Some will hide themselves, but in the end you will destroy them.
\p
\v 21 “Do not be afraid of the nations of the land of Canaan, for the LORD our God will be with you. He is a great and awesome God!
\v 22 The LORD will drive out the nations little by little. You will not be allowed to finish them off all at once, because if that happens, the wild beasts there will increase so much that they will endanger you.\x + \xo 7:23 \xt Ex. 23:27-30\x*
\v 23 That is how the LORD our God will help you to defeat your enemies by making them panic until they perish.
\v 24 He will hand over their kings to be under your authority. You will destroy them, even their names will no longer be remembered in the world. No nation will be able to oppose you, and you will destroy them all.
\p
\v 25 “You must burn their wooden carvings of idols. Don't covet the silver or gold ornaments of the statues. Don't take anything! These objects are traps that can destroy you. If you take these things, you are taking things that the LORD your God hates.
\v 26 Such things have been appointed by the LORD to be destroyed. So if you bring anything that the LORD hates into your house, then you will also be destroyed! You must hate such things."
