\s1 Blessings for obeying God's commands
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, "When the LORD our God brought you into the land which you will soon enter and control, and He drove out seven nations who were stronger and more numerous than you, namely the Hittites, Girgash, Amorites. , Canaan, Perizz, Hewi, and Jebus,
\v 2 and when the LORD handed over the nations to you, you destroyed them all without exception. Don't make a peace treaty with any of them, and don't be sorry for them.
\v 3 Do not have mixed marriages with them. Don't give up your daughters to marry their sons. And do not let your sons marry their daughters,
\v 4 because the women will influence your sons to worship their gods. Allah will be very angry with you and will immediately destroy you if you violate His commandments\x + \xo 7:4 \xt Deut. 5:7 \x*.
\v 5 This is what you must do to these nations: Destroy the altars where they sacrificed animals. Also destroy the stone pillars of idols, cut down the wooden posts which are the symbol of the goddess Asherah, and burn all the statues of their gods.
\v 6 You must do this, because we are a people sanctified by the LORD to Him. From among all the other nations of the earth, we have been chosen by the LORD our God to be His own special possession.
\p
\v 7 "God loves and chose us not because we are outnumbered by the other nations. In fact, we are the least numbered of all other nations.
\v 8 But the LORD chose us because He loved us, and because He kept His promises to our fathers. That's why He used His mighty power to save us from the power of the king of Egypt and bring us out of bondage there.
\v 9 So, don't forget that the LORD is the only God. He is a God who is worthy of trust, and He will be faithful to do what He promised us, even for thousands of generations, as long as we continue to love Him and obey His commandments.
\v 10 But He will punish those who hate Him by destroying them. He didn't delay getting back at them.
\v 11 So, you must take care of yourself to comply with all the commandments, rules and regulations that I am giving you today.
\p
\v 12 "If you always obey these rules, the LORD God will keep his covenant with you and will always love you, according to his promise to your ancestors.
\v 13 He will love and bless you, and multiply your number. He will bless you with many children and bless your gardens and fields so that they produce abundant grain, wine, and olive oil. He will also multiply your cows and sheep. The LORD will give these things to you in the land that He promised you by swearing to your ancestors.
\v 14 He will bless you more than any other nation. You and your descendants will not be barren. Likewise your livestock.
\v 15 The LORD will also protect you from all sicknesses, so that you do not suffer terrible diseases like those that were afflicted by the Egyptians. But He will punish your enemies with these diseases!
\p
\v 16 “When you take possession of the land of Canaan, you must destroy all the inhabitants that the LORD has given to you. Don't have mercy on them, and don't worship their gods. If you do so, you will fall into a trap that will destroy you.
\v 17 Don't ever think, "The nations of this land are stronger than us, how can we possibly drive them out?"
\v 18 Don't be afraid of them! Remember what the LORD did to the king of Egypt and all his people.
\v 19 You have seen for yourself how the LORD uses his mighty power to bring disasters and all kinds of wonders upon them, so that you may be freed from that land. He will do the same for the people you now fear.
\v 20 Even the LORD will give them panic,\f + \fr 7:20 \fk gives panic \ft The meaning of the Hebrew word translated as 'panic' is uncertain. Some people translate as 'wasp', or other animal that can sting. If that is the meaning, then the animal can be considered a metaphor for panicking.\f* so that many of them will run away from your presence. Some will hide themselves, but in the end you will destroy them.
\p
\v 21 “Do not be afraid of the nations of the land of Canaan, for the LORD our God will be with you. He is a great and awesome God!
\v 22 The LORD will drive out the nations little by little. You will not be allowed to finish them off at once, because if that happens, the wild beasts there will grow too much to harm you.\x + \xo 7:23 \xt Ex. 23: 27-30\x*
\v 23 This is how the LORD our God will help you to defeat your enemies by causing them panic until they perish.
\v 24 He will give their kings over to your power. You will destroy them, even their names will no longer be remembered in the world. No nation will be able to fight you, and you will destroy them all.
\p
\v 25 “You must burn their wooden idol carvings. Don't covet the silver or gold ornaments of the statues. Don't take anything! These objects are traps that can destroy you. If you take these things, you are taking the things that the LORD your God hates.
\v 26 Such things have been appointed by the LORD to be destroyed. So if you bring anything that the LORD hates into your house, then you will also be destroyed! You must hate things like that."
