\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the Israelites, “When you go to war and see horses, chariots, and enemy troops that are more numerous than you, don't be afraid! Know that the LORD God who brought us out of Egypt will be with each of you.
\v 2 Before you go to war, a priest must give an encouraging speech for you like this,
\v 3 'O Israelites, listen! Today you will fight against the enemy. Don't be discouraged. Don't be afraid, panic, or tremble to face them,
\v 4 because the LORD will be with each of you. He will fight the enemy and make us win.'
\p
\v 5 "Then the commanders should say to their soldiers, 'If any of us has just built a house and hasn't had its dedication ceremony yet, he may go home. Don't let him die in war and someone else dedicate the house and own it.
\v 6 If any of you have planted a vineyard and haven't harvested it yet, he may go home. Don't let him die in war and let others enjoy the first produce of the vineyard.
\v 7 If any of you are engaged to a woman but have not yet had the opportunity to marry her, he may go home. Don't let him die in war and someone else marry his fiancée.'
\v 8 Finally, commanders need to say, 'If any of you are afraid and discouraged, he may go home. Don't let him influence the other troops to be afraid too.'
\p
\v 9 “After speaking with their troops, the commanders will appoint the squad leaders.
\v 10-15 "When you want to attack a city that is far away and does not belong to the territory that the LORD will soon give to the Israelites, offer the inhabitants of that city the opportunity to live if they accept a number of conditions and surrender. If they agree and open the city gates, then they will become your slaves. But if they refuse the offer and instead get ready to fight, surround the city and break your way inside. When the LORD enables you to conquer the city, kill all the males there. But you may take the women, children, livestock, and all kinds of plunder from that city. Consider the enemy's property as already given by the LORD to be yours.
\p "This rule applies to cities that are far away and does not include cities belonging to the nations that now inhabit the land of Canaan, which the LORD will soon give to you.
\v 16 For cities belonging to the Canaanite region, destroy all humans and animals in them.
\v 17 The LORD has appointed the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites to be destroyed. You must finish them all off.
\v 18 If not, they will influence you to do the detestable things that they do while worshiping their gods, so that you will fall into sin against the LORD our God.
\p
\v 19 “When you are trying to conquer a city and are besieging it for a long time, don't cut down the fruit trees around it. Why be hostile toward a fruit tree?! Leave it, so that you can eat the fruit later.
\v 20 However, you can cut down trees that do not produce food and use the wood to make ladders and weapons of war that can help you break through the city walls and conquer them.”
