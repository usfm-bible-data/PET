\c 8
\s1 The people of Israel must remember what the LORD has done for them
\p
\v 1 Moses continued his advice to the people of Israel, “You must be faithful in obeying all the commandments I give you today. If you do, you will live, your descendants will multiply, and you will enter and possess the land that the LORD promised to our ancestors.
\v 2 Remember how the LORD your God led you through the wilderness for forty years. Through it all, He intended to humble you and test each of you so that he could know what is in your heart. He wanted to know whether or not you would keep His commandments.
\v 3 So the LORD humbled your hearts by letting you become hungry, then gave you 'manna', bread that neither we nor our ancestors had ever eaten. He did this to teach you that man lives not only by relying on food, but also on every word of the LORD.\x + \xo 8:3 \xt Luke. 4:4; Matt. 4:4\x*
\v 4 Even though you wandered for forty years in the wilderness, your clothes were not worn out, and your feet were not swollen.
\v 5 So, realize how much the LORD has educated you, just as a father educates his child.
\p
\v 6 “Therefore, keep the commandments of the LORD! Live according to His will, fear and honor Him.
\v 7 He is bringing you to a fertile land, where rivers, ponds, and springs abound, and its waters flow from the hills to the valleys.
\v 8 The land is also abundant with fig and pomegranate trees, and it produces wheat, barley, grapes, olives, and honey.
\v 9 The land is abundant with food. All your needs will be met. The land there contains iron ore, and you can mine copper from the hills.
\v 10 Then when you eat to your satisfaction, you should praise the LORD for all the prosperity you enjoy in that land.
\p
\v 11 "Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God by breaking His commandments, His regulations, and His statutes that I convey to you today.
\v 12 In the land of Canaan you will eat well, and you will be able to build and live in fine houses.
\v 13 Your livestock will increase, and you will also collect a lot of gold, silver and other treasures.
\v 14 When that happens, be careful that you do not become arrogant and forget the LORD your God, who freed you from slavery in Egypt!
\v 15 Do not forget that He led you on a journey through a vast and terrible wilderness. There were many poisonous snakes and scorpions there. The land was very dry and there was no running water, but He made water flow out of a very hard rock.
\v 16 Do not forget that in the wilderness He gave you manna, food that neither we nor our ancestors had ever eaten. In that way, He tested us for our good, because He wants us to be humble.
\v 17 So be careful that you never think, "I have acquired all these treasures by my own strength and ability."
\v 18 Always remember that your ability to become rich comes from the LORD alone! He gives it to keep His promise that He made to our ancestors.
\p
\v 19 "So now I give a stern warning to each of you: If you forget the LORD your God by turning to gods and worshiping them, then you will surely perish!
\v 20 Just as the LORD has destroyed all the other nations that are hostile to us, so you will also be destroyed if you do not obey Him!”
