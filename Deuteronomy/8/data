\c 8
\s1 **Moses reminded the people of Israel to remember and to obey the LORD
\p
\v 1 “You must faithfully obey all the commands I give to you today. If you do them, then you will have long life, your descendants will increase in number, and you will enter and possess the land that has been promised by the LORD to our ancestors.
\v 2 Remember how the LORD your God led you along the journey in the wilderness for forty years. Through all those He intend to humble you and test each of you so that He can know what is in your heart. He wants to know whether you will stay obedient to His commands or not.
\v 3 So the LORD humbled you by means of letting you hunger and then give you manna— bread that neither us nor our ancestors ever ate before. He did this to teach you that humans live not just by relying on food, but by relying on everything the LORD says.
\v 4 Your clothes did not wore out and your feet did not swell even though you walked in the wilderness for forty years.
\v 5 Pay attention at how the LORD your God taught you. He taught us like a father taught his child.
\v 6 “So, obey the commands of the LORD your God! Live according to His will and fear and respect Him.
\v 7 He is bringing you to a fertile land, where rivers, ponds, and springs are abundant, and the water flows from hills to valleys.
\v 8 The land is also rich with fig trees and pomegranate trees, and produce wheat, barley, grape, olive, and honey.
\v 9 That land is abundant with food. All your needs will be fulfilled. The land there contains iron ore, and you can mine copper from the hills.
\v 10 Later when you are there, when you eat until you are full, you should praise the LORD your God because of all the abundance that you enjoy in that land!
\v 11 “Guard yourselves that you don’t forget the LORD your God by not obeying His commands, His rules, and His statutes that I convey to you today.
\v 12 Because later in the Land of Canaan you will be satisfied with food, and you will be able to build and occupy good houses.
\v 13 The number of your livestocks and sheep will increase, and you will also gather much gold, silver, and your other riches will also be many.
\v 14 But at that time, guard yourselves that you don’t become arrogant and forget the LORD your God— who freed you from the slavery in Egypt!
\v 15 Don’t forget that He guides you to go through the journey through the vast and scary wilderness. There are many poisonous snakes and scorpions. The land is very dry and there is no flow of water, but He made water flow from a really hard stone.
\v 16 Don’t forget that in the wilderness He gave manna to you— food that neither we nor our ancestors ever ate before. In that way He tested us for our own good, because He wants us to be humble.
\v 17 So, guard yourselves so you never think in your heart, “I have obtained all these by my own strength and ability.”
\v 18 Always remember that your ability to be rich comes only from the LORD your God! In that way He is still faithful until today to fulfill His covenant which is bound with our ancestors.
\p
\v 19 “So today I give this strong warning to each person among us: If you forget the LORD your God by turning to fake gods and bow down and worship them, then you will surely be destroyed.
\v 20 Just like how the LORD already destroyed a few other nations that are against us, you will also be destroyed if you refuse to obeh the LORD your God!”
