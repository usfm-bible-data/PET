\s1 Rock of remembrance at Mount Ebal
\p
\v 1 Moses together with the leaders of Israel said to that nation, "Obey all of the commands that I give to you today.
\v 2-4 At the time you cross the Jordan River and enter into the land that the LORD God is giving to you, a land rich and fertile, according to His promise to our forefathers, raise up several large rocks at Mount Ebal, cover them with whitewash, and write all of these laws on those rocks.
\v 5 And make an altar there from stone to the LORD God, but don't chisel those stones with iron tools.
\v 6 That altar must be made from whole stones. Offer burnt sacrifices to the LORD God there.
\v 7 Also offer sacrifices expressing thanksgiving for peace with God there, and celebrate by eating those offerings there along with rejoicing before the LORD our God.
\v 8 And write all of these laws on those rocks very clearly."
\s Curses for not obeying the LORD
\p
\v 9 Then Moses gave the following orders and the priests\f + \fr 27:9 \fk priests \ft Literally the Hebrew language writes 'priests of (the tribe) of Levi'. If translated 'priests of the tribe of Levi' the reader may get the wrong meaning that there were priests from other tribes. However that's not the meaning. All of the priests were of the tribe of Levi who originated from descendants of Aaron. At the time this event happened, their were only three priestsâ€” who were Aaron and his two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar. (Two of Aaron's sons died, as is told of in Lev. 10.) So certainly there were also messengers who were appointed from the tribe of Levi to carry on Moses' sayings to all of the people of Israel. At that time, Israel had more than 600,000 men who were over 20 years of age and who were worthy to enter the war troops.\f* and chosen heralds from the tribe of Levi carried it on to all of the people of Israel, "Oh Israel, be quiet and listen: Today you have become the LORD God's chosen people.
\v 10 So, you have to obey Him by doing all of His rules and statutes that I deliver to you today."
\p
\v 11 That day Moses said to the people of Israel,
\v 12 "After you cross the Jordan River, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin must stand on top of Mount Gerazim and express blessings on that nation.
\v 13 While the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulon, Dan, and Naphtali must stand on the top of Mount Ebal and express curses on that nation.
\p
\v 14 "The descendants of Levi must shout the words loudly to all of the Israelites,
