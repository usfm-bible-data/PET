\v 1 Moses told the leaders of Israel to say to all the people, “Keep all the commandments I give you today.
\v 2-4 According to the promise of the LORD God to our ancestors, soon you will cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the LORD has given to you. When you enter this rich and fertile land, set several large stones on Mount Ebal, cover them with chalk, and write all these laws on the stones.
\v 5 Also make an altar of stone to the LORD there. Do not chisel the stones with iron tools.
\v 6-7 The altar must be made of whole stones. Then use this altar to offer up many burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD. Organize a feast from the sacrifice, and rejoice before the LORD our God.
\v 8 Do not forget, write all these laws on the stones very clearly."

\v 9 Then Moses gave the following messages, and the priests\f + \fr 27:9 \fk priests \ft The Hebrew text literally has 'priests (of the tribe) of Levi'. Indeed, all the priests were descended from Aaron who is of the tribe of Levi. There are no priests from other tribes. At the time of this incident, there were only three priests — namely Aaron and his two sons: Eleazar and Ithamar (two of Aaron's other sons had died, see Lev. 10). So, there must have been messengers who were appointed from the tribe of Levi to pass on the words of Moses to all the people of Israel. At that time Israel had more than 600,000 males who were age 20 and over and who were fit to enter the army.\f* and chosen announcers from the tribe of Levi passed them on to all the people of Israel, "O people of Israel, be quiet and listen: Today you are already a people belonging to the LORD God.
\v 10 So, you must obey Him by carrying out all His rules and regulations that I convey to you today."

\v 11 On that day Moses commanded the people of Israel,
\v 12 "After you cross the Jordan River, perform this memorial service: The tribes of Simeon, Levi, Judah, Isaac, Joseph, and Benjamin will stand on Mount Gerizim and pronounce various blessings\x + \xo 27:12 \xt Deut. 28:1-4\x* on the Israelites if they obey the LORD.
\v 13 While the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali will stand on Mount Ebal and pronounce various curses\x + \xo 27:13 \xt Deut. 27:14-26; 28:15-68\x* against the Israelites if they disobey the LORD.

\v 14 "At that time the tribe of Levi shall shout these words aloud to all the people of Israel,
