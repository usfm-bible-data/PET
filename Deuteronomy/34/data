\s1 Moses dies
\p
\v 1 Then from the plains of Moab, Moses ascended to the top of Pisgah on Mount Nebo, across from Jericho. From there the LORD showed him the whole land,
\li2 from Gilead to Dan,
\li2
\v 2 all the territory that would later belong to the tribes of Naphtali, Ephraim and Manasseh,
\li2 and the area that stretched to the Mediterranean Sea, which later belonged to the tribe of Judah,
\li2
\v 3 also the wilderness of the Negev in the southern region of Judah,
\li2 and the Jordan Valley which stretches from Jericho to the city of Zoar.
\m
\v 4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "This is the land that I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying to them, 'I will give the land to your descendants.'\x + \xo 34:4 \xt Gen. 12:7; 26:3; 28:13\x* I have now permitted you to see it from afar, but you will not enter there."
\p
\v 5 Then Moses, the LORD's servant, died in the land of Moab, just as the LORD had said.
\v 6 The LORD buried Moses in a valley in Moab, opposite the city of Beth Peor, but until the day of the writing of this book no one knows the location of Moses' grave.
\v 7 Moses was 120 years old when he died, but his body was still strong and his eyes were not weak.
\v 8 The Israelites mourned him in the plains of Moab for 30 days.
\p
\v 9 The LORD gave Joshua extraordinary wisdom, because he had been appointed by Moses as his successor. Therefore the people of Israel obeyed Joshua and did all the commandments of the LORD that had been delivered by Moses.
\p
\v 10 Until the writing of this book, there has never been a prophet like Moses in Israel, who repeatedly spoke directly to the LORD.
\v 11 There is no other prophet who performed great wonders at the command of the LORD, as Moses did to the king of Egypt, his servants, and the whole land.
\p
\v 12 There is no other prophet who was given the mighty power to do terrible and dreadful things as Moses did before all the people of Israel.
