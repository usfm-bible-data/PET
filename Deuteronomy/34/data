\c 34
\s1 Moses dies
\p
\v 1 Then from the plain of Moab, Moses climbed to the peak of Pisgah on Mount Nebo, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him all of that landâ€” that is
\li2 the area of Gilead to the city of Dan,
\li2
\v 2 all of the district of the tribe of Naphtali, Ephraim and Manasseh, the district of the tribe of Judah that spreads out to the Mediteranian Sea, 
\li2
\v 3 the wilderness of Negeb on the south part of the district of Judah, and the Jordan valley that spreads from Jericho to the city of Zoar.
\m
\v 4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "This land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by saying to each of them, 'I will give this land to your descendants.' Now I have permitted you to see it from afar, but you will not enter there."
\p
\v 5 Then Moses, servant of the LORD died in Moab, like what was said by the LORD.
\v 6 The LORD buried Moses in a valley in Moab, across from the City of Beth-Peor, but until today no one knows for certain the location of Moses' grave. 
\v 7 Moses was 120 years old when he died. At that time, Moses was still strong and could see well.
\v 8 The nation of Israel mourned him on the plain of Moab for 30 days.
\p
\v 9 The LORD made Joshua become very wise because he was appointed by Moses as the new leader of the nation of Israel. Because of that the nation of Israel obeyed Joshua and they did all of the LORD's commands that Moses delivered to them.
\p 
\v 10 After that, there was never a prophet like Moses in Israel, who spoke directly directly and face to face with the LORD.
\v 11 There will never be another prophet that does miracles like Moses. He did all of those miracles to the king of Egypt, his employees and to that whole land at the LORD's command.
\v 12 There will never be another prophet who does amazing and terrible deeds like those done by Moses before all of the Israelites.
