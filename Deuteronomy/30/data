\s1 Blessings if returning to the LORD
\p
\v 1 Moses continued to speak, “All of the blessings and curses that I deliver will happen to you all, and you all will remember them if you all live among other nations, where the LORD will throw you all.
\v 2 If at that time you all along with your descendants return to the LORD God, and with your whole heart and soul obey His commands that I deliver to you today,
\v 3 then the LORD God will be compassionate and heal your situation. He will gather you all back from among other nations where He has scattered you all.
\v 4 Though you were thrown to all corners of the earth, He permanently will bring you all back. 
\v 5 The LORD God will bring you all back to the land of your forefathers and you will return to rule that land. He will make you become more prosperous and many more than your forefathers.
\v 6 The LORD God will change your hearts\f + \fr 30:6 \fk change your hearts \ft Literally circumcise your hearts.\f* and each of your descendants so that every person loves Him with all of their hearts and all of their souls so that you may continue to live in this land. 
\v 7 The LORD God will pour out all of these curses on the enemies that hate and persecute you all. 
\v 8 You all will again obey all of the commands of the LORD that I deliver today.
\v 9 The LORD God will make you succeed in all of your work. He will bless each of you with many children, many animals, and abundant harvest produce, because He wants to make you prosper, just like He was happy to bless your forefathers.
\v 10 But if you want to be blessed like that, you must obey all of His commands and statutes, and and always turn back to Him with your whole heart and your whole soul.
\s1 Choose life
\p
\v 11 “The commands that I (Moses)] deliver to you today aren't too difficult for you to do nor are outside your understanding.
\v 12 These commands aren't kept in the sky so that you must ask, 'Who can climb up to the sky and bring them back to us, so that we can hear and do them?'
\v 13 These commands also aren't kept across the sea so that you must ask, 'Who can cross the sea to bring them back for us, so that we can hear and do them?'
\v 14 These commands of His are very close to us, and each of you knows them in your hearts and can express them with your mouths, so that you can do them. 
\p
\v 15 “Pay attention! Today I present you with two choices, between life and death, between goodness and destruction. 
\v 16 Today I command you to love the LORD your God, live according to His ways, and obey His commands, statutes, and rules. If you do them, then you will live and become a great nation, and the LORD God will bless you in the land that you will enter and rule.
\v 17 "But if your hearts turn and don't want to hear Him, and are even captivated to worship (pagan) deities, 
\v 18 I warn you today, you will certainly be destroyed! You won't live long in the land across the Jordan River, that you will enter and rule.
\p
\v 19 “Now I have presented you with the choice between life and death, the blessings of the LORD or His curses. May the sky and earth become witnesses of your choice! Choose life, so that you and your descendants may live!
\v 20 Love the LORD our God, obey Him, and hold tightly to Him always, because He is the one who gives you life. If you love and obey him, you will live long lives in the land that the LORD promised to give to our forefathers.”
