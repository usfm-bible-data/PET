\s1 Blessings upon returning to the LORD
\p
\v 1 Moses continued his teaching to the people of Israel, “In the future, each of you and your descendants will experience all the blessings of the LORD God that I have spoken about. Then when you turn away from the LORD, you will experience all the curses that I have also spoken about. But later in the foreign nation where the LORD will scatter you, you will remember all that is written in this book of the law.
\v 2 If later you and your descendants return to the LORD with all your heart and obey His commandments which I convey today,
\v 3 then the LORD God will be merciful and restore the condition of everyone who returns to Him. He will also return to gather each of you from those other nations.
\v 4 Even if you are cast to the ends of the earth, He will still bring you back.
\v 5 The LORD God will bring you back to the land of your fathers, and you will return to possess the land of Israel. He will make your descendants more prosperous and more numerous than you are now.
\v 6 The LORD will change your heart\f + \fr 30:6 \fk change your heart \ft The Hebrew literally says 'circumcise the heart'.\f* and your respective offspring so that everyone will love Him with all their heart, so that you can continue to live in this country.
\v 7 Then the LORD will apply all these curses to enemies who hate and oppress you,
\v 8 and everyone among you will become even more obedient to all the commandments of the LORD that I convey today.
\v 9 He will make you successful in all your work. He will bless you with many children, lots of livestock, and abundant crops, because He desires to make you prosperous, just as He was pleased to bless your ancestors.
\v 10 But to receive all these blessings, you must return to Him with all your heart and keep all His commandments and statutes which are written in this book of the law.
\s1 Choose life
\p
\v 11 “All the commandments that I convey to you today are not too difficult for us to do and are not beyond our understanding.
\v 12 The commandments of the LORD are not kept in heaven\f + \fr 30:12 \fk heaven \ft This Hebrew word can also be translated as 'sky'. The TSI chose to translate it as 'heaven' because it is more understandable that the Word of the LORD is stored in God's dwelling place in heaven rather than in the sky.\f* so that we have to ask, 'Who can go up there to get it for us, so we can hear and do it?'
\v 13 Nor are the commandments kept on the other side of the sea so that we have to ask, 'Who can cross the great sea to get it for us, so that we can hear and do it?'
\v 14 Surely the commandment of the LORD is very close to us! You already know it and are able to teach it to others. So now the only thing left is to just do it.
\p
\v 15 “Pay attention! Today I offer you two choices: live with prosperity, or have misfortune unto death.
\v 16 Love the LORD your God, live according to his will, and keep his commandments and statutes and regulations. In this way our nation will continue to live and grow in size, and the LORD God will bless you in the land that you are about to possess.
\p
\v 17 "But if your heart turns away from the LORD and you refuse to listen to Him, and instead you are enticed to worship gods,
\v 18 I warn you today: You will definitely perish! You will not live long in that land beyond the Jordan River.
\p
\v 19 “So today I have given you a choice, live with the LORD's blessing, or experience His curse unto death. Let heaven and earth be witnesses of your choice! For the good of yourself and your descendants, choose life!
\v 20 To do this, love the LORD our God, obey him, and always hold fast to him. He is the source of life for you! If you love Him and obey Him, you will remain in the land that the LORD promised to give to our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”
