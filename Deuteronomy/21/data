\s1 Rules concerning murder when the culprit is unknown
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “When you are living in the land that the LORD God has given you, when you find the body of someone who has been killed, but whose killer is unknown,
\v 2 then the leaders and judges must go and measure the distance from the place where the body was found to the surrounding cities.
\v 3 The leaders in the town closest to where the body was found had to take a young cow that had never been used for work.
\v 4 They are to take the young cow into a valley where there is flowing water and which has never been tilled or cultivated and then break the neck of the cow there.
\v 5 The priests from the tribe of Levi must also be present, because the LORD God has appointed them to make decisions in every matter, to serve Him, and pray to the LORD to bless the people of Israel.\x + \xo 21:5 \xt Num. 6:23-26; Deut. 10:8\x*
\v 6 Then all the leaders of the city closest to the corpse are to wash their hands on the veal, whose neck has been broken.
\v 7 and must say, 'We didn't kill this man, and we don't know who the killer is.
\v 8-9 O LORD, forgive your people whom thou hast delivered from Egypt, and we shall not bear the sins of the murder of an innocent man. 'By doing this, you will do what is right in the eyes of the LORD and atone for the shedding of blood that. So in the eyes of the LORD, the inhabitants of that city will no longer be held responsible for the murder of this innocent man."
\s1 Regulations regarding the marriage of female prisoners
\p
\v 10 "When you go to war with the enemy and the LORD our God gives victory over them, maybe there will be people from the enemy side that you are capturing.
\v 11 If you see a beautiful woman captive and want her to be your wife,
\v 12 take her to your house. Then the woman should shave her hair, cut her nails,\f + \ fr 21:12 \fk shaving her hair and cutting her nails \ft The provisions for a woman to shave her hair, cut her nails, and change her clothes are thought to be a sign of leaving her old habits and customs by starting a new life according to Israelite customs.\f*

\v 14 If in the future you don't want the woman anymore, then you must let her go. You cannot treat her as a slave or sell her, because you have defiled her.”
\s1 Regulations regarding the inheritance of the firstborn
\p
\v 15 "If a man has two wives, one is loved and the other is not, then the two wives give birth to a son for him but the firstborn is born to an unloved wife,
\v 16 so when a person distributes the inheritance to his children, he is not allowed to give the portion of the firstborn to the child of the wife he loves.
\v 17 He must acknowledge his firstborn son, the son of an unloved wife, by giving the child a double inheritance from the other children. The eldest son is the first proof that he can have children, so that child is entitled to a share of the firstborn's inheritance."
\s1 Rules about a rebellious child
\p
\v 18 "If later there is a boy who is stubborn and rebellious, who is not obedient to his parents even though he has often been educated,
\v 19 then his parents were to bring him to the congregation\f + \fr 21:19 \fk congregation \ft Literally, 'the leaders at the city gate.' In Old Testament times, city gates served as the seat of leaders and to administer justice.\f* the leaders of their cities,
\v 20 then said, 'Our son is stubborn, rebellious, and disobedient to us. He likes to waste money and get drunk.'
\v 21 Then the people of that city must stone him to death. That way, you will eradicate evil from among the Israelites, and everyone will hear the news about it and be afraid to live like that."
\s1 Regulations concerning the burial of persons sentenced to death
\p
\v 22 "If someone committed a serious mistake and then was put to death by hanging from a tree or wooden poles,
\v 23 don't leave the body hanging there all night. The corpse must be buried on that very day, because whoever is hanged is the one whom Allah cursed. So, don't defile the land that the LORD has given you as your own right from generation to generation, by violating this rule."
