\s1 Rules concerning murder when the culprit is unknown
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “Later, when you are already living in the land that the LORD God is giving to you, when you find the body of someone who has been killed, but the killer is unknown,
\v 2 then the leaders and judges must go and measure the distance from the place where the body was found to the surrounding cities.
\v 3 The leaders in the town closest to where the body is found must take a heifer that has never been used for work.
\v 4 They must take the heifer into a valley where there is flowing water and which has never been tilled or cultivated and then break the neck of the cow there.
\v 5 The priests from the tribe of Levi must also be present, because the LORD God has appointed them to make decisions in every case, to serve Him, and pray to the LORD to bless the people of Israel.\x + \xo 21:5 \xt Num. 6:23-26; Deut. 10:8\x*
\v 6 Then all the leaders of the city closest to the corpse must wash their hands over the heifer, whose neck has been broken,
\v 7 and must say, 'We didn't kill this man, and we don't know who the killer is.
\v 8-9 O LORD, forgive your people whom you have delivered from Egypt, and let us not bear the sin of the murder of an innocent man.' By doing this, you will do what is right in the eyes of the LORD and atone for the shedding of that blood. So in the eyes of the LORD, the inhabitants of that city will no longer be held responsible for the murder of that innocent man."
\s1 Regulations regarding the marriage of female captives
\p
\v 10 "When you go to war with the enemy and the LORD our God gives victory over them, perhaps there will be people from the enemy side that you take captive.
\v 11 If you see a female captive who is beautiful and want her to be your wife,
\v 12 take her to your house. Then the woman must shave her hair, cut her nails,\f + \fr 21:12 \fk shave her hair and cut her nails \ft The provisions for a woman to shave her hair, cut her nails, and change her clothes are thought to be a sign of leaving her old habits and customs by starting a new life according to Israelite customs.\f*
\v 13 and change the clothes worn by her when taken captive. She must stay in your house and mourn for a month because she has lost her parents. After that, then you may marry that woman.
\v 14 If in the future you don't want the woman anymore, then you must let her go. You cannot treat her as a slave or sell her, because you have already defiled her.”
\s1 Regulations concerning the inheritance of the firstborn
\p
\v 15 "If a man has two wives, one who is loved and another who is not, and the two wives give birth to a son for him but the firstborn is born from the unloved wife,
\v 16 then when that person distributes the inheritance to his children, he is not allowed to give the portion of the firstborn to the child of the wife he loves.
\v 17 He must acknowledge his firstborn son, the son of the unloved wife, by giving the child double the inheritance given to the other children. The eldest son is the first evidence that he can have children, so that child is entitled to the share of the inheritance of the firstborn."
\s1 Rules about a rebellious child
\p
\v 18 "Later, if there is a boy who is stubborn and rebellious, who is disobedient to his parents even though he has often been educated,
\v 19 then his parents must bring him to the assembly\f + \fr 21:19 \fk assembly \ft Literally, 'the leaders at the city gate.' In Old Testament times, city gates served as the seat of leaders and for administering justice.\f* of their city leaders,
\v 20 then say, 'Our son is stubborn, rebellious, and disobedient to us. He likes to waste money and get drunk.'
\v 21 Then the people of that city must stone him to death. That way, you will eradicate evil from among the Israelites, and everyone will hear the news about him and be afraid to live like that."
\s1 Regulations concerning the burial of persons sentenced to death
\p
\v 22 "If someone commits a serious offense and is put to death by hanging from a tree or wooden pole,
\v 23 don't leave the body hanging there all night. The corpse must be buried on that very day, because whoever is condemned to hang is cursed by God. So, don't defile the land that the LORD is giving you as your own possession from generation to generation, by violating this rule."
