\s1 Rules regarding murder when the murderer isn't known
\p
\v 1 If in the land that the LORD God gives you you find the body of someone that has been murdered, but you do not know who the murderer is,
\v 2 then your elders and judges must go and measure the distance from where the body was found to the surrounding cities.
\v 3 The helder of the city closest to where the body was found must take a young cow that has never been used to work.
\v 4 They must take the young cow to a valley with running water, that has never been plowed or sown, and there break the neck of the said cow.
\v 5 The Levite priests also must come there, because the LORD God has chosen them to make a decision in every case and to serve Him and give blessings in His name.
\v 6 Then all the elders
\v 7 and must say, 'We didn't kill this person, and we don't know who killed him.
\v 8 Yes LORD, forgive Your people whom You have freed from Egypt, and don't make us bear the guilt for this person's murder who wasn't wrong.

\s1 Rules about marrying female captives
\p
\v 10 "When you go to war against enemies, and the LORD God gives you the victory, you may make them become your captives.
\v 11 If among you there is someone who sees a female captive who is beautiful, so that you want that woman to become your wife,
\v 12 bring her to your house. Then that woman must shave her hair and cut her nails \f + \fr 21:12 \fk shave her hair and cut her nails \ft This provision for a woman to shave her hair, cut her nails and change her clothing was considered to be a sign of leaving her old customs and culture by beginning a new life according to the culture of Israelites.\f*
\v 13 That woman must change her clothing that was worn when she was captured. That woman must remain in your house and mourn for one month because of the loss of her parents. After that, you may marry that woman.
\v 14 If in future days you don't want that woman any more, then you must allow that woman to go. You may not treat that woman as a slave and may not sell her, because you've shamed that woman."
\s1 Rules regarding the firstborn child's inheritance
\p
\v 15 "Suppose a man has two wives, and he loves one person, but he doesn't love the other person. And when the second wife gives birth to a boy for him, and the first born is from the wife he doesn't love.
\v 16 Then when he divides his inheritance wealth to his children, he may not give the first born child's portion to the son of the wife he loves.
\v 17 He must acknowledge his firstborn, that is the son of the wife that he doesn't love, by giving him two times the inheritance compared with that given to the other children, because the firstborn child is the proof that he can possess descendants, and has the right to the firstborn child's portion.
\s1 Rules regarding the child who likes to rebel
\p
\v 18 "If there is a male child who is hard headed and a rebel, who doesn't obey his parents even though they punish him,
\v 19 then the parents must bring him to the city leaders where they live,
\v 20 and say to them, 'Our son is hard headed, likes to rebel, and won't obey us. He likes to waste money and likes to get drunk.'
\v 21 Then all of the people of that city must throw stones at him until he dies. In that way you all will eradicate evil from among you all, and all of the Israelites will hear and become afraid."
\s1 Rules regarding burial of a person who was sentenced to die
\p
\v 22 "When a person does a great evil and is sentenced to die by hanging on a tree or on a wooden post,
\v 23 don't let his body hang there all night. That body must be buried that day too, because whoever is hanged on a tree is cursed by God. Don't defile the land that the LORD our God is giving to you all as a generational gift.
