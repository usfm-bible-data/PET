\s1 The portion for the tribe of Levi
\p
\v 1-2 Next Moses said to the people of Israel, “All the tribes of Levi, including the priests, will not have any part of the land to inherit from their descendants like the other tribes of Israel, because the portion they receive is the LORD Himself. This means that they have the privilege of being His servants from generation to generation, as He had promised them. So the Levites will receive food from the offerings of the other tribes of Israel to the LORD, and it will be considered their inheritance.
\p
\v 3 “When the Israelites offered their livestock as a burnt offering, the priests were entitled to have the shoulder, jaw, and belly of that sacrifice.
\v 4 All other tribes of Israel were obliged to give first results\f + \fr 18:4 \fk first results \ft The first result given to the tribe of Levi was not tithes. It is not known now how much was given. The term "first yield" could be interpreted as the first part harvested, or the best part of the crop.\f* they referred to the tribes of Levi, such as wheat and barley, pressed wine, olive oil, and fleece.
\v 5 Do all of this, for the LORD our God has appointed the tribe of Levi from among the Israelites to serve Him continually.
\p
\v 6 “When a Levite of his own accord moved from any of the cities of Israel to the city where the LORD's tabernacle was,
\v 7 then he may serve the LORD in the tent, like the other Levites who had served there.
\v 8 He will receive the same portion of food as the other Levites, even though his family supports him with money."\f + \fr 18:8 \fk his family supports... \ft The Hebrew source text is difficult to decipher . The last phrase can also be translated, 'Even if he has (money) from the sale of his family's property.'\f*
\s1 Prohibition of various magic practices
\p
\v 9 “Later, when you enter the land that the LORD our God gave you, do not imitate the various detestable deeds that were done by the nations that previously lived there.
\v 10-11 Do not let any of you offer his son as a burnt offering. And let no one predict the future, either by means of sorcery or soliciting guidance from evil spirits or the spirits of the dead. Don't any of you witch doctors get paid to curse others. Let no one give advice based on the guidance of the spirits of the dead, or by being possessed by a psychic spirit.\f + \fr 18:10-11 \fk prohibited types of magic \ft These two verses contain many Hebrew terms for various kinds practice witchcraft. Indonesian does not have the exact same term, and the terms that do exist are often more generic than those in Hebrew. Therefore, in the TSI these restrictions are rearranged and explained in phrases. What is important in this verse: All kinds of sorcery and witchcraft are prohibited.\f*
\v 12 The LORD hates anyone who does such disgusting deeds. In fact, the LORD will drive out the Gentiles from before you because they have done these things.
\v 13 But each of you must live without fault in the eyes of the LORD your God.
\v 14 The nations you are about to cast out listen to the prophecies of witch doctors and use sorcery, but the LORD forbids you to do all these things. "
\s1 The promise that a prophet like Moses will come
\p
\v 15 "The LORD our God will lift up \f + \fr 18:15 \fk lift \ft The Hebrew word which is translated 'lift up' here can be translated 'to raise up'. However, in this context, what is meant is not “to raise from the dead,” but “to send, establish, to bring.” This prophecy was fulfilled by Christ. See Acts. 3:22; 7: 37.\f* a prophet \f + \fr 18:15 \fk prophet \ft At the time Moses wrote this prophecy, he and his readers did not understand that the prophet who was to be sent was divine, so the TSI did not use capital letters here.\f* again for you, a prophet like me, who comes from our own nation. Listen and obey the prophet.
\v 16 The LORD did this to answer your petitions when gathered at the foot of Mount Sinai. At that time you asked me, 'We beg you not to hear the voice of the LORD or see the fire burning on the mountain! We will die if we continue to hear His voice.'\x + \xo 18:16 \xt Deut. 5:23-27\x*
\p
\v 17 "Then the LORD said to me, 'What they said was good.
\v 18 Then I will raise up a prophet like you from among them. I will tell him the message he has to say, and he will convey to them all that I command.
\v 19 Anyone who does not listen to the message that I convey through the prophet, I will punish him.
\v 20 On the other hand, if someone claims to be a prophet and dares to say, “The LORD told me to deliver this message, "- even though I didn't tell him to say it - or if he delivers a message on behalf of the gods, then that person should be put to death."
\p
\v 21 Then Moses said, "Maybe you will ask, 'How do we know if the message that was sent to us came from God or not?'
\v 22 The trick is, notice whether the prophetic prophecy happened. If this happens, it means that God sent him to deliver the prophecy. But if it does not happen, it means that the message is not really from God. So, the prophet is not a messenger of God, and you don't need to be afraid of him."
