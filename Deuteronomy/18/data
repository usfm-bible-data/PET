\c 18
\s1 Portion for the tribe of Levi
\p
\v 1 Moses continued to speak, "The whole tribe of Levi— including the priests—will not get a portion of land to bequethe to their descendants like the other tribes of Israel. They will eat from the offerings by the other tribes of Israel to the LORD, because that is their portion.
\v 2 Instead of getting a portion of land as inheritance like the other tribes, the inheritance that they actually receive is the LORD Himself— which is the special right to become His servants, like He had promised to them.
\p
\v 3 "When the Israelites offer their livestock as burned sacrifices, the priests have the right to a portion of the shoulder, jaw and stomach of the sacrifice.
\v 4 All of the other tribes of Israel are required to give the first from the wheat, wine, and olive oil harvests, and the shearing of sheeps' wool to the people of the tribe of Levi.
\v 5 Do all of that because the LORD our God has appointed the tribe of Levi from among the nation of Israel to always serve Him.
\p
\v 6 "If a Levite of his own desire moves from one city in Israel to the place of worship that the LORD shows,
\v 7 then he may serve the LORD like other Levites that already serve there.
\v 8 He will receive a portion of food the same as that received by the other Levites. Do this even if his family supports him financially."
\s1 Various prohibitions of sorcery and occult practices
\p
\v 9 "When you have already entered the land that the LORD our God gives to you later, don't copy various disgusting deeds that are done by other nations that used to live there.
\v 10-11 Don't let anyone among you offer his child as a burnt offering. And don't let anyone of you predict things that will happen— whether based on sorcery or on information from demons or spirits of the dead. Don't let there be a shaman among you that is paid to curse another person. Don't let anyone advise another person based on information from spirits of the dead, or when possessed by a predictive spirit.\f + \fr 18:10-11 \fk types of sorcery that are prohibited \ft These two verses contain many terms in the Hebrew language regarding various kinds of sorcery and occult practices. The Indonesian language doesn't have the exact same terms, and the terms that there are, are more generic than the terms in the Hebrew language. Because of that in the TSI the prohibitions in these verses are reordered and explained with phrases, not with abstract nouns. What is important in this verse is: All of the types of sorcery and occultism are forbidden.\f*
\v 12 Whoever does disgusting deeds like these is hated by the LORD. That is precisely why the LORD is driving out the nations from before you because they do those practices.
\v 13 Each of you must live righteously in the eyes of the LORD your God.
\v 14 The nations that you will drive out hear shaman's predictions and use sorcery. But you are forbidden to do those things."
\s1 The promise that a prophet like Moses will come
\p
\v 15 "The LORD will send\f + \fr 18:15 \fk send \ft The word that is translated 'send' in the TSI is often translated 'raise up' in the English language. But in this context, the word 'kum' in the Hebrew language as well as the translation 'raise up' don't mean to raise from the dead. The meaning here is to 'make him become a leader' or 'make his influence greater'.\f* a prophet like me from among you Israelites. You must hear and obey him.
\v 16 In that way the LORD answers your prayers. Because when we gathered at the foot of Mount Sinai, you begged me saying, 'We beg not to hear the voice of the LORD again, or to see the fire that smolders at the top of the mountain! We will die if the LORD continues to speak to us!'
\p
\v 17 “Then the LORD said to me: What they say is true.
\v 18 So from among them I will send a prophet for them like you. I will tell him the message that he must speak, and he will tell them all that I command.
\v 19 Whoever doesn't listen to what that prophet speaks in My name, then I Myself will punish him.
\v 20 But if there is someone who claims that he is a prophet and bravely expresses a false message in My name— although I didn't order him to say it— or if he delivers a message in the name of another worshipped being, then that person must be sentenced to die.'
\p
\v 21 “If you ask, ‘How can we know if a message that is delivered to us didn't come from the LORD?’
\v 22 The answer is that if a prophet prophesies in the name of the LORD, but what he prophesies doesn't happen, then that message is truly not from the LORD. That prophet isn't sent by the LORD, and you don't need to be afraid of him.”
