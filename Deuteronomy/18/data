\s1 Portion for the tribe of Levi
\p
\v 1-2 Next Moses said to the people of Israel, “The entire tribe of Levi, including the priests, will not obtain a portion of the land to be given as an inheritance to their descendants like the other tribes of Israel, because the portion they receive is the LORD Himself. This means that they have the privilege of being His servants from generation to generation, as He promised them. So the Levites will receive food from the offerings of the other tribes of Israel to the LORD, and it will be considered their inheritance.
\p
\v 3 “When the Israelites offer their livestock as a burnt offering, the priests are entitled to have the shoulder, jaw, and belly of that sacrifice.
\v 4 All other tribes of Israel are obliged to give their first yield\f + \fr 18:4 \fk first yield \ft The first yield given to the tribe of Levi was not a tithe. It is unknown now how much was given. The term "first yield" could be interpreted as the first portion harvested, or the best part of the crop.\f* to the tribe of Levi, such as wheat and barley, pressed wine, olive oil, and fleece.
\v 5 Do all of this, for the LORD our God has appointed the tribe of Levi from among the Israelites to serve Him continually.
\p
\v 6 “When a Levite moves from any of the cities of Israel of his own accord to the city where the LORD's tabernacle is located,
\v 7 then he may serve the LORD at the tabernacle, like the other Levites who are already serving there.
\v 8 He will receive the same portion of food as the other Levites, even though his family supports him with money."\f + \fr 18:8 \fk his family supports... \ft The Hebrew source text is difficult to decipher. The last phrase can also be translated, 'Even if he has (money) from the sale of his family's property.'\f*
\s1 Prohibition of various types of witchcraft
\p
\v 9 “Later, when you have entered the land that the LORD our God is giving to you, do not imitate the various detestable deeds that were done by the nations that previously lived there.
\v 10-11 Let there be no one among you who offers his child as a burnt offering. And let no one predict the future, either by means of sorcery or soliciting guidance from evil spirits or the spirits of the dead. Let there be no witch doctors who get paid to curse others among you. Let no one give advice based on the guidance of the spirits of the dead, or by being possessed by a spirit that can see into the future.\f + \fr 18:10-11 \fk prohibited types of witchcraft \ft These two verses contain many Hebrew terms for various kinds of witchcraft. Indonesian does not have the exact same terms, and the terms that do exist are often more generic than those in Hebrew. Therefore, in the TSI these restrictions are rearranged and explained in phrases. What is important in this verse: All kinds of sorcery and witchcraft are prohibited.\f*
\v 12 The LORD hates anyone who does such detestable deeds. In fact, the LORD is about to drive out other nations from before you because they have done these things.
\v 13 But each of you must live without fault in the eyes of the LORD your God.
\v 14 The nations you are about to drive out listen to the prophecies of witch doctors and use sorcery, but the LORD forbids you to do any of these things."
\s1 The promise that a prophet like Moses will come
\p
\v 15 "The LORD our God will appoint\f + \fr 18:15 \fk appoint \ft The Hebrew word that is translated 'appoint' here can be translated 'raise up'. However, in this context, what is meant is not “to raise from the dead,” but “to send, establish, to bring.” This prophecy was fulfilled by Christ. See Acts. 3:22; 7:37.\f* a prophet\f + \fr 18:15 \fk prophet \ft At the time Moses wrote this prophecy, he and his readers did not understand that the prophet who was to be sent was divine, so the TSI did not use capital letters here.\f* again for you, a prophet like me, who will come from our own nation. Listen and obey that prophet.
\v 16 The LORD does this to answer the petition you made when gathered at the foot of Mount Sinai. At that time you asked me, 'We beg you not to hear the voice of the LORD or see the fire burning on the mountain again! We will die if we continue to hear His voice.'\x + \xo 18:16 \xt Deut. 5:23-27\x*
\p
\v 17 "Then the LORD said to me, 'What they say is good.
\v 18 So I will raise up a prophet like you from among them. I will tell him the message he must say, and he will convey to them all that I command.
\v 19 Anyone who does not listen to the message that I convey through the prophet, I will punish him.
\v 20 Conversely, if someone claims to be a prophet and dares to say, “The LORD told me to deliver this message,"- even though I didn't tell him to say it - or if he delivers a message in the name of gods, then that person must be put to death."
\p
\v 21 Then Moses said, "Perhaps you will ask, 'How do we know if a message sent to us is from the LORD or not?'
\v 22 This is the way, take notice of whether or not the prophecy of that prophet comes to pass. If it happens, it means the LORD sent him to deliver the prophecy. But if it does not happen, it means that the message is not really from the LORD. So, the prophet is not a messenger of of the LORD, and you don't need to be afraid of him."
