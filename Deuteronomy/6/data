\c 6
\s1 Loving God is the main commandment
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “The LORD our God has instructed me to convey these commandments, statutes, and regulations to you. Obey all of these things in the land you will enter and possess.
\v 2 You and your descendants must fear and honor the LORD your God throughout your life, and must obey all of His commandments that I am conveying, so that you may remain in the land.
\v 3 Hear, O Israel, and obey all these things carefully, so that your life will be increasingly prosperous and your descendants will increase more and more when you inhabit this rich and fertile land. For this is the promise the LORD God of our fathers made to you.
\p
\v 4 “Hear, O Israel. The LORD our God is the only God.
\v 5 Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all the breath of your life,\f + \fr 6:5 \fk all the breath of your life \ft translates the words that are usually translated 'jiwa' or 'soul' in English. The meaning of this word in Hebrew is quite broad, it can include "breath", "life" and "emotion". The TSI does not use 'soul' in this verse because it is difficult to understand how someone can deliberately do something with their soul. To most people, the meaning of the soul is simply the part of the human being that is still alive after the body dies.\f* and with all your strength.
\v 6 Instill in your heart the commandments of the LORD that I convey to you today.
\v 7 Teach these commandments repeatedly and all the time to your children, both at home and on the go, whether at rest or at work.
\v 8-9 Write these commandments on the doorposts of your houses, the gates of your city, even tie the words of these commandments on your hands and on your foreheads, so that you always remember and do them.\f + \fr 6:8 \fk meaning of the commandment in verses 8-9 \ft The intention of Moses in these two verses is to give four examples of signs of remembrance so that the LORD's commandments are always remembered and carried out. But unfortunately, the scribes and Pharisees at the time of Jesus interpreted these two verses literally (physically), and forgot to do other commandments of the LORD. That is why Jesus rebuked them at Matthew 23:5, 23-26.\f*

\v 10 “The LORD your God will bring you into the land that He promised to our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He will give you great and prosperous cities that you did not build,
\v 11 houses full of treasures you did not buy, wells you did not dig, vineyards and olive gardens you did not plant. After the LORD has brought you into the land, and you are able to eat all you want until you are satisfied,
\v 12 then be careful! Don't forget the LORD who brought you out of bondage in Egypt.
\v 13 Fear and honor the LORD. Serve Him alone. And when you ratify a covenant, swear by saying the name of the LORD alone.
\p
\v 14 "Do not worship the gods of other nations around you,
\v 15 because the LORD your God who dwells among you is a jealous God.\x + \xo 6:15 \xt Deut. 4:24\x* If you worship a god, he will be angry with you and will cut you off from the earth.
\v 16 Do not test the patience of the LORD your God, as your ancestors did when you camped in the wilderness of Massah.\x + \xo 6:16 \xt Ex. 17:1-7; Num. 20:2-13\x*
\v 17 Keep all the commandments, regulations, and statutes of the LORD that He has given you.
\v 18-19 Do what is right and please the LORD, so that you may prosper, and so that the LORD will fulfill his promise that he confirmed to our ancestors, that he will drive out all our enemies so that you can enter and rule the fertile land of Canaan.
\p
\v 20 "Later, when your child asks, 'What is the meaning of the rules, regulations, and laws that our LORD God commanded?'
\v 21 answer this way, 'Our ancestors were slaves of the king of Egypt, but the LORD brought them out of there with his mighty power.
\v 22 They saw the LORD do many wonders, which made the king of Egypt and all his people suffer.
\v 23 The LORD saved our ancestors from Egypt to give this land to them, according to the covenant He made with our ancestors.
\v 24 And the LORD commanded us to always fear and honor Him, and obey all these statutes, so that we may always live in prosperity and that he may take care of our lives, as we have experienced to this day.
\v 25 If we obey all the commandments of the LORD our God, then we will remain righteous in His sight.'"
