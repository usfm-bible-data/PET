\c 6
\s1 To love the LORD is the main commandment
\p
\v 1 “The LORD our God told me to teach these various teachings, statutes, and rules to you. Obey all of these in the land that you will enter and possess.
\v 2 You and your descendants must fear and respect the LORD our God all your lives, and must obey all His commandments, so you may stay long in that land.
\v 3 Listen, O people of Israel, and obey all this meticulously, that you will be successful, and your number increase when you already stay in that land that is rich and prosperous. Bcause that is the promise of our LORD— the God of our ancestors, to you.
\p
\v 4 “Hear, o people of Israel: the LORD our God is one.
\v 5 Love the LORD your God will all your heart, the whole of your mind, and in all that you do.
\v 6 Keep the commands that I convey to you today in your hearts.
\v 7 Teach these commands again and again and at all times to your children— whether when you are at home or when you are in a journey, whether when resting or when working.
\v 8 Write these commands and tie them to your hands and on your foreheads so that you always remember His commands.\f + \fr 6:8 meaning of the commands in verse 8-9\ft What Moses intends to mean in these two verses can be interpretted figuratively with a meaning like this: The LORD’s commands should be always be thought about in your efforts (literally, ‘works of your hands’), in your views (literally, ‘in the middle of your eyes’), and be visible in your abode. As a second interpretation, what Moses means to say here can be interpretted as four examples on how to make various physical reminders to remember the LORD’s commands. Unfortunately, the Torah experts and Pharisees during Jesus’ days interpret these two verses only literally. That is why Jesus reprimanded them in Matthew 23:5)\f*
\v 9 Write these commands on the doorposts of your house and on the gates of your cities.
\p
\v 10 “The LORD your God will bring you into the land that He promised by vowing to our ancestors— Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He will give you large and prosperous cities that you did not build,
\v 11 houses full of treasures that you did not buy, wells that you did not dig, and grape and olive plantations that you did not plant. After the LORD bring you into that nation and you eat until you are full,
\v 12 be careful! Don’t forget the LORD, who already brought you out of the slavery in Egypt.
\v 13 Fear and respect the LORD your God and serve (dedicate yourself) only to Him. And when making official agreement, validate it with saying the name of the LORD only.
\p
\v 14 “Don’t worship gods of other nations that live around you,
\v 15 because the LORD your God that lives in the midst of you, is a jealous God. If you worship false gods, He will be angry towards you and will destroy you from this earth.
\v 16 Don’t test the patience of the LORD your God, as your ancestors did when they camped in the Masa wilderness.
\v 17 Obey all commands, rules, and statutes of the LORD your God, which He has given to you.
\v 18-19 Do what is right and pleasing to the LORD so that you will be prosperous,. As He has already promised, He will drive away all your enemies so that you can enter and occupy this fertile land, that the LORD promise to our ancestors.
\p
\v 20 “In the future, when your children asks, ‘What is the meaning of the rules, statutes, and laws thathe LORD our God commands?’
\v 21 then answer like this, ‘Long ago our ancestors are slaves of the king of Egypt, but with His great power, the LORD brought them out of Egypt.
\v 22 They saw the LORD did many miracles that made the Egyptian residents, king, and his officials suffer.
\v 23 And the LORD saved our ancestors from Egypt to ring them in and give this nation to them— according to His official agreement that he made with our ancestors.
\v 24 The LORD our God commanded us to always fear and respct Him, and obey all these statutes, so that we always live prosperously and so He take care of our lives, like now.
\v 25 If we are obedient to all the commands of the LORD our God, then we will stay right in His eyes.’”
