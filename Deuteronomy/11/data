\c 11
\s1 Call to remember and obey the LORD
\p
\v 1 “Love the LORD your God and always obey all His commands, statutes, and laws.
\p
\v 2 Remember all that you witnessed about how the LORD repeatedly taught us and disciplined us through His greatness and power. Your children do not have experiences like that, so you have to teach it to them.
\li2
\v 3 Your children did not see the miracles that He did in Egypt and His deeds towards the king of Egypt and his land.
\li2
\v 4 They did not see how He destroyed the Egyptian soldiers along with all their horses and chariots, how He caused the Red Sea to drown those soldiers when they ran after you.
\li2
\v 5 Your children did not see what He did for you in the wilderness until you arrived here.
\li2
\v 6 They did not see what He did towards Dathan and Abiram, the children of Elian from the tribe of Reuben, how in the midst of the people of Israel the earth divided and swallowed them along with their family, their tents, servants, and their livestocks.
\m
\v 7 But you have witnessed the great things that the LORD did with your own eyes!
\p
\v 8 “So, obey all the commands that I already told you today, so that you become strong and able to cross the Jordan River and conquer the land that you will enter.
\v 9 In that way you can live long in the land that the LORD already promised with a vow to our ancestors. Because He already promised to give that land to them and their ancestors, a rich and fertile land.
\v 10 The land that you will enter and conquer is not like Egypt, where you lived before. There, after planting seeds in the field, you have to work hard to water them. \f + \fr 11:10 \fk work hard … \ft Literally, the Hebrew writes ‘by (using) your feet.’ It means, Egypt has a dry weather, and when watering their field, they must bring water by walking, or they use a simple pump that is pedalled using feet.\f*
\v 11 But in the land that you will conquer there are hills and valleys, and there rain falls frequently.
\v 12 The LORD your God takes care of that land. All year round He always pays attention to that land.
\p
\v 13 “If you obey the command that I am teaching you today— that is to love the LORD your God and worship Him with all your heart and soul—
\v 14 then the LORD will cause rain to fall in your land in its seasons— whether in the sowing season or towards the harvest season— so that you can harvest wheat for your food, grape for your drink, and olive fruit for your oil.
\v 15 And the LORD will provide much grass in your field for feed for your livestocks. Everyday you will eat until you are full.
\p
\v 16 “But guard your heart! Don’t ever leae the LORD your God and worship false gods!
\v 17 If you do that, the LORD will be very angry to you. He will hold back rain so that it will not fall again, so that your field will not give good yield/ Then you will quickly die from hunger in the fertile land that the LORD will give you.
\p
\v 18 So, continue to ponder the words of the LORD. Keep all His commandments in your heart and soul. Write these commands and bind them on your hand and your forehead so that you will always remember His commands.
\v 19 Teach all these to your children repeatedly— whether when you are at home of when you go, whether before sleep at night or after waking up.
\v 20 Write the LORD’s commands in the door posts of your house and on the door gates of your city.
\v 21 Do all these so that you and your descendants have long life in the land that the LROD promise to our ancestors. As long there is sky above the earth, may your descendants continue to dwell there.
\p
\v 22 So if you always obey all the commands that I teach— that is to love the LORD your God, walking through life according to his will, and continue to be faithful to Him—
\v 23 then the LORD will drive all the nations that are before you, and you will seize their land, even though those nations are much bigger and stronger than you.
\v 24 “Every piece of land in that land that you will tread on will be yours. You territory will be from the wilderness in the south up to the Lebanon mountains in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west.
\v 25 The LORD your God will make nations in that land become afraid of you, as He promised. There will be no nation that can stand to go against you.
\p
\v 26 “Listen carefully, on this day I already told you that the LORD will bless or curse you.
\v 27 You will be blessed by the LORD your God if you obey all the commands that I teach today.
\v 28 But you will be cursed if you don’t obey is commands, but instead leae the right way that Iam teaching by worshipping false gods who you never worshipped before.
\p
\v 29 “When the LORD brings you into the land that you will enter and conquer, you must have a ceremony. Some of you will stand on the peak of Mount Gerizim and some will stand in the peak of Mount Ebal. Those of you who are in Gerizim will pronounce with a loud voice the deeds that behaviors that will invite the LORD’s blessing, and those in the Mount of Ebal will reply in pronouncing behaviors that invite God’s curse.” \f + \fr 11:29 \fk verse 29 \ft For the sake of clarity, translation of this verse is supplemented with information from Deu. 27:11-26.\f*
\v 30 (Both of those mountains are located on the west side of Jordan River, in the area of Jordan Valley where some of the Canaanites dwell. It is located towards the west and not far from the More sacred trees near the city of Gilgal.)
\v 31 Not much longer you will cross the Jordan River to conquer the land that the LORD God gave to you. After you conquer that land and live there,
\v 32 you must obey all rules and statutes that I taught to you today.”
