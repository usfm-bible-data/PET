\s1 Contemplating and teaching the LORD's commands to children
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “You must love the LORD your God and always keep all his commandments, statutes, and laws.
\v 2 Remember that your children have not experienced all the things that you have witnessed, namely how the LORD has repeatedly educated us through His majesty and power. So you have to teach them.
\li2
\v 3 Your children have not seen the miracles that He did to the king of Egypt and his land.
\li2
\v 4 Your children did not see how He annihilated the Egyptian army and all their horses and chariots by drowning the soldiers in the Red Sea while they were after us.
\li2
\v 5 Your children did not see what He did for you in the wilderness until you came here.
\li2
\v 6 They did not see what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, of the tribe of Reuben, how in the midst of the camp of the Israelites the land was divided and swallowed them up, along with their families and servants, also the tents and their livestock.
\m
\v 7 But you have seen all the terrible things that the LORD has done with your own eyes.
\p
\v 8 "Therefore, keep all the commandments that I am teaching everyone of you today again, so that you may be strong and can cross the Jordan River and then control the land that you are about to enter.
\v 9 That way you will be able to live in the land that the LORD has promised by swearing to our ancestors. Because He had promised to give them and their descendants the land, a land that was rich and fertile.
\v 10 The land which you will enter and control is not like Egypt, where you previously lived. There, after planting the seed in the field, you have to work hard to water it.\f + \fr 11:10 \fk toil ... \ft the Hebrew literally says 'with (using) your feet'. That is, Egypt has dry weather, so to irrigate fields, they have to carry water on foot, or use a simple pump that is rotated by foot.\f*
\v 11 But in the land which you shall rule there are hills and valleys, and there it often rains.
\v 12 The LORD your God has taken care of the land and cares for it all year round.
\p
\v 13 "If you obey the commandments I teach today, namely to love the LORD your God and worship Him with all your breath of life,\f + \fr 11:13 \fk with all your breath of life \ft Deut. 6:5\f*
\v 14 then the LORD will send rain on your land in its season, both in the planting season and just before the harvest, so that you will abundantly harvest wheat, grapes, and olives.
\v 15 The LORD will also provide plenty of grass in your fields for food for your flocks. Every day you will eat until you are full.
\p
\v 16 “But keep your heart! Lest you leave the LORD your God and worship gods!
\v 17 If you do this, the LORD will be very angry with you. He will keep the rain from falling again, so that your fields don't produce good yields. Then you will soon starve to death in the fertile soil that the LORD has given you.
\p
\v 18 "So, keep meditating on all the words of the LORD that I teach today. Keep all His commandments in your heart and mind. Write these commandments and tie them on your hands and on your foreheads so that you always remember His commandments.\x + \xo 11:18 \xt Deut. 6:8-9\x*
\v 19 Teach these commandments repeatedly to your children, both at home and on the go, both at rest and at work.
\v 20 Write the LORD's commandments on the doorposts of your houses and on the gates of your cities.
\v 21 Do all these things so that you and your descendants may remain in the land that the LORD promised our fathers to give us. So long as there is heaven on earth, your descendants will continue to live there.
\p
\v 22 "For if each of you always obey all the commandments that I teach — that is, to love the LORD your God, to live according to His will, and keep holding on to Him—
\v 23 then the LORD will drive out all the nations that are before you, and you will take over their land, even though these nations are much greater and stronger than you.
\v 24 Every piece of land you walk on in the land will be yours. Your territory will go from the wilderness in the south to the mountains of Lebanon in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean in the west.
\v 25 The LORD your God will make the nations of the land fear you, just as he promised. Whichever area you advance, no one will be able to defend against you.
\p
\v 26 "Every one of you, listen carefully! Today I am telling you that the LORD will either bless you or curse you, depending on your choice!
\v 27 You will be blessed by the LORD your God if you obey all the commandments that I teach you today.
\v 28 But you will be cursed if you do not obey His commandments and leave this true path that I teach, by worshiping gods that have never been worshiped by our nation.
\p
\v 29 "When the LORD brings you to the land which you are going to enter and rule, you must hold a memorial service. Some of you will stand on Mount Gerizim and some of you will stand on Mount Ebal. You who in Gerizim must announce aloud the behavior that invites God's blessing, and those on Mount Ebal will retaliate by announcing behavior that invites the LORD's curse."\f + \fr 11:29 \fk verse 29 \ft To be clear, the translation of this verse is supplemented by information from Deut. 27:11-26.\f*
\v 30 (These two mountains were to the west of the Jordan River, in the area of the Jordan Valley where some of the Canaanites were still living at the time Moses gave this advice. They are to the west and not far from the sacred trees of Moreh near the city of Gilgal.)
\v 31 Soon you will cross the Jordan River to control the land that the LORD has given you. After you occupied the land,
\v 32 you must obey all the rules and regulations that I am teaching you today."
