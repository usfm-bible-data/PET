\s1 Meditating on and teaching the LORD's commandments to children
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “You must love the LORD your God and always keep all his commandments, statutes, and laws.
\v 2 Remember that your children have not experienced all the things that you have witnessed, namely how the LORD has repeatedly educated us through His majesty and power. So you have to teach them.
\li2
\v 3 Your children have not seen the miracles that He did to the king of Egypt and his land.
\li2
\v 4 Your children did not see how He annihilated the Egyptian army and all their horses and chariots by drowning the soldiers in the Red Sea while they pursued us.
\li2
\v 5 Your children did not see what He did for you in the wilderness until you came here.
\li2
\v 6 They did not see what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, of the tribe of Reuben, how in the midst of the camp of the Israelites the land was divided and swallowed them up, along with their families and servants, as well as their tents and their livestock.
\m
\v 7 But you have seen all the awesome things that the LORD has done with your own eyes.
\p
\v 8 "Therefore, keep all the commandments that I am teaching again to everyone among you today, so that you may be strong and can cross the Jordan River and then possess the land that you are about to enter.
\v 9 That way you will be able to live in the land that the LORD has promised with an oath to our ancestors. For He promised to give them and their descendants the land, a land that is rich and fertile.
\v 10 The land that you will enter and possess is not like Egypt, where you previously lived. There, after planting the seed in the field, you had to work hard to water it.\f + \fr 11:10 \fk work hard... \ft the Hebrew literally says 'with (using) your feet'. The meaning is that Egypt has dry weather, so to irrigate a field, they had to carry water on foot, or use a simple pump that is rotated by foot.\f*
\v 11 But in the land that you shall possess there are hills and valleys, and there it often rains.
\v 12 The LORD your God always takes care of the land and pays attention to it all year round.
\p
\v 13 "If you obey the commandments I teach today, namely to love the LORD your God and worship Him with all the breath of your life,\f + \fr 11:13 \fk with all the breath of your life \ft Deut. 6:5\f*
\v 14 then the LORD will send rain on your land in its season, both in the planting season and just before the harvest, so that you will harvest wheat, grapes, and olives in abundance.
\v 15 The LORD will also provide plenty of grass in your fields for food for your flocks. Every day you will eat until you are full.
\p
\v 16 “But keep watch over your heart! Lest you leave the LORD your God and worship gods!
\v 17 If you do this, the LORD will be very angry with you. He will hold back the rain so that it doesn't come down anymore, so that your fields don't produce good yields. Then you will soon starve to death in the fertile land that the LORD has given you.
\p
\v 18 "So, continue to meditate on all the words of the LORD that I teach today. Keep all His commandments in your heart and mind. Write down these commandments and tie them on your hands and on your foreheads so that you always remember His commandments.\x + \xo 11:18 \xt Deut. 6:8-9\x*
\v 19 Teach these commandments repeatedly to your children, both at home and on the go, both at rest and at work.
\v 20 Write the LORD's commandments on the doorposts of your houses and on the gates of your cities.
\v 21 Do all these things so that you and your descendants may remain in the land that the LORD promised our fathers to give to us. So long as there is a sky above the earth, your descendants will continue to live there.
\p
\v 22 "For if each of you always obey all the commandments that I teach — that is, to love the LORD your God, to live according to His will, and to keep holding on to Him—
\v 23 then the LORD will drive out all the nations that are before you, and you will take over their land, even though these nations are much greater and stronger than you.
\v 24 Every piece of land you walk on in that country will be yours. Your territory will go from the wilderness in the south to the mountains of Lebanon in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean in the west.
\v 25 The LORD your God will make the nations of the land fear you, just as he promised. To whichever area you advance, no one will be able to defend against you.
\p
\v 26 "Every one of you, listen carefully! Today I am telling you that the LORD will either bless you or curse you, depending on your choice!
\v 27 You will be blessed by the LORD your God if you obey all the commandments that I teach you today.
\v 28 But you will be cursed if you do not obey His commandments and leave this right path that I teach, by worshiping gods that have never been worshiped by our nation.
\p
\v 29 "When the LORD brings you to the land that you are going to enter and possess, you must hold a ceremony of remembrance. Some of you will stand on Mount Gerizim and some of you will stand on Mount Ebal. Those of you who stand on Gerizim must announce aloud the behavior that invites the LORD's blessing, and those on Mount Ebal will respond by announcing the behavior that invites the LORD's curse."\f + \fr 11:29 \fk verse 29 \ft To be clear, the translation of this verse is supplemented by information from Deut. 27:11-26.\f*
\v 30 (These two mountains are located to the west of the Jordan River, in the area of the Jordan Valley where some of the Canaanites were still living at the time Moses gave this advice. They are to the west and not far from the sacred trees of Moreh near the city of Gilgal.)
\v 31 Soon you will cross the Jordan River to possess the land that the LORD is giving to you. After you occupy the land,
\v 32 you must obey all the rules and regulations that I am teaching you today."
