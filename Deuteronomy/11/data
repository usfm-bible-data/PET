\c 11
\s1 Call to remember and obey the LORD
\p
\v 1 “Love the LORD your God and always obey all of His commands, statutes, and laws.
\p
\v 2 Remember all that you witnessed about how the LORD repeatedly taught us and fixed us through His greatness and power. Your children do not yet have experiences like that, so you have to teach it to them.
\li2
\v 3 Your children did not see the miracles that He did in Egypt and His actions toward the king of Egypt and his land.
\li2
\v 4 They did not see how He destroyed the Egyptian soldiers along with all of their horses and chariots, and how He caused the Red Sea to drown those soldiers when they chased us.
\li2
\v 5 Your children did not see what He did for you in the wilderness until you arrived here.
\li2
\v 6 They did not see what He did towards Dathan and Abiram— the sons of Eliab from the tribe of Reuben— how in the midst of the people of Israel the earth divided and swallowed them along with their familes, their tents, servants, and their livestock.
\m
\v 7 But you have witnessed the great things that the LORD did with your own eyes!
\p
\v 8 “For that reason, obey all of the commands that I have told you today, so that you become strong and able to cross the Jordan River and conquer the land that you will enter.
\v 9 In that way you can live long in the land that the LORD already promised with a vow to our ancestors. Because He already promised to give that land to them and their ancestors, a rich and fertile land.
\v 10 The land that you will enter and conquer is not like Egypt, where you lived before. There, after planting seeds in the field, you had to work hard to water them. \f + \fr 11:10 \fk work hard … \ft Literally, the Hebrew writes ‘by (using) your feet.’ It means, Egypt had dry weather, and when watering their fields, they had to bring water by walking, or they used a simple pump that was pedaled with the feet.\f*
\v 11 But in the land that you will conquer there are hills and valleys, and rain falls there frequently.
\v 12 The LORD your God takes care of that land. All year round He always pays attention to that land.
\p
\v 13 “If you obey the command that I am teaching you today— that is to love the LORD your God and worship Him with all of your heart—
\v 14 then the LORD will cause rain to fall in your land in its seasons— both in the sowing season and approaching the harvest season— so that you can harvest wheat for your food, grapes for your drink, and olives for your oil.
\v 15 And the LORD will provide much grass in your fields for feed for your livestock. Everyday you will eat until you are full.
\p
\v 16 “But guard your hearts! Don’t ever leave the LORD your God and worship false gods!
\v 17 If you do that, the LORD will be very angry at you. He will hold back rain so that it doesn't fall anymore, so that your fields will not give good yield. Then you will quickly die from hunger in the fertile land that the LORD will give you.
\p
\v 18 So, continue to ponder all the words of the LORD that I have taught today. Keep all of His command in your hearts and souls. Write these commands and bind them on your hands and on your foreheads so that you will always remember His commands.
\v 19 Teach all of these to your children repeatedly— both when you are at home or when you go out, both before sleeping at night or after waking up.
\v 20 Write the LORD’s commands on the door posts of your houses and on the gates of your cities.
\v 21 Do all of these so that you and your descendants live long lives in the land that the LORD has promised to our ancestors. As long there is sky above the earth, may your descendants continue to dwell there.
\p
\v 22 So if you always obey all the commands that I teach— that is to love the LORD your God, living your lives according to his will, and remaining faithful to Him—
\v 23 then the LORD will drive out all of the nations that are before you, and you will seize their land, even though those nations are much larger and stronger than you.
\v 24 “Every piece of ground in that land that you will tread on will be your possession. Your territory will be from the wilderness in the south up to the Lebanon mountains in the north, and from the Euphrates River on the east to the Mediterranean Sea on the west.
\v 25 The LORD your God will make nations in that land become afraid of you, as He promised. There will be no nation that will be able to oppose you.
\p
\v 26 “Listen carefully, on this day I've already told you that the LORD will bless or curse you.
\v 27 You will be blessed by the LORD your God if you obey all of the commands that I teach today.
\v 28 But you will be cursed if you don’t obey His commands, but instead leave the right way that I am teaching by worshiping false gods whom you've never worshiped before.
\p
\v 29 “When the LORD brings you into the land that you will enter and conquer, you must hold a ceremony. Some of you will stand on the peak of Mount Gerizim and some will stand on the peak of Mount Ebal. Those of you who are on Gerizim will announce with a loud voice the behaviors that invite the LORD’s blessing, and those on Mount Ebal will reply in announcing the behavior that invites God’s curse.” \f + \fr 11:29 \fk verse 29 \ft For the sake of clarity, translation of this verse is supplemented with information from Deu. 27:11-26.\f*
\v 30 (Both of those mountains are located on the west side of the Jordan River, in the area of the Jordan Valley where some of the Canaanites dwell. It is located towards the west and not far from the sacred trees of Moreh near the city of Gilgal.)
\v 31 Not long from now you will cross the Jordan River to conquer the land that the LORD God gives to you. After you conquer that land and live there,
\v 32 you must obey all of rules and statutes that I have taught to you today.”
