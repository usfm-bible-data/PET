\s1 Rules for divorce and remarriage
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the Israelites, “One day something like this might happen: Not long after marriage, a husband does not like his wife because he finds something inappropriate with her, so her husband writes a letter of divorce, gives her the letter, and tells the woman to leave his house.
\v 2 If the woman later marries another man,
\v 3 but her second husband either divorces her or dies,
\v 4 then her first husband may not remarry her, because she is already defiled. The LORD hates this deed very much! Do not commit a detestable sin like this in the land that the LORD your God is giving to you!”
\s1 Several other rules

\v 5 “Newly married men may not be sent to war or charged with other general duties. He must be permitted to stay at home for one year to be happy with his wife.
\p
\v 6 “Do not take a grain mill as collateral for debt, because the owner needs that object to make flour, so that it can be sold and for there to be food to support his family.
\p
\v 7 “If someone kidnaps a fellow Israelite and makes him a slave or sells him, that kidnapper must be put to death. In this way, you will eradicate such evil from among the people of Israel.
\p
\v 8 “If a person has a contagious skin disease, carry out all the directions of the Levite priests carefully. Obey the commandments that I have told them.\x + \xo 24:8 \xt Lev. 13-14\x*
\v 9 Remember what the LORD God did to Miriam when we were on our way out of Egypt.\x + \xo 24:9 \xt Num 12:1-16\x*
\p
\v 10 “If you lend money or other items to someone, do not go into their house to collect collateral.
\v 11 Stand outside his house and let him take the collateral himself and hand it over to you.
\v 12 But if the person is so poor that he can only provide warm clothes as collateral, do not hold the collateral until evening.
\v 13 When the sun goes down return the warm clothes so he can wear it to sleep. If you do that, he will be grateful for your kindness, and the LORD will consider you as having acted right.
\p
\v 14 "Do not oppress poor day laborers, be they fellow Israelites or immigrants.
\v 15 Pay his wages every day before sunset, because he is poor and needs the money. If you withhold his wages and he complains to the LORD about what you have done to him, then you will be considered sinful in the LORD's eyes.
\p
\v 16 “A father cannot be put to death for a crime his son has committed. And a child cannot be put to death for a crime that has been committed by his father. Those who are sentenced to death are the perpetrators of the crimes themselves.
\p
\v 17 “Ensure that immigrants and orphans are always treated fairly. Do not take a widow's clothes as collateral for her debt.
\v 18 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and the LORD God delivered you from there. For this reason, you must do good to immigrants, the poor, orphans, and widows.
\p
\v 19 “When you harvest your fields, if you accidentally leave a bunch of wheat in the field, don't come back for it. Leave it for foreigners, orphans, and widows. If you obey this commandment, the LORD God will bless you in all your endeavors.
\v 20 When you pick olives in your garden, don't come back to pick up what was left of the fruit. Let the fruit be for immigrants, orphans, and widows.
\v 21 Likewise, when you are harvesting grapes in your vineyard, do not return to pick the grapes left behind. Let the fruit be for immigrants, orphans, and widows.
\v 22 Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt. Therefore you must be kind to people in need."
