\c 24
\s1 Rules regarding divorce and remarriage
\p
\v 1 "Suppose a man marries a woman and then in the future he doesn't like that woman anymore because of some disgrace to that woman. Then he writes a letter of divorce, he surrenders it to that woman, and orders that woman to go from his house.
\v 2 Then that woman goes and marries another man.
\v 3 If later the second husband also doesn't like her, surrenders a letter of divorce to her, and orders her to go from his house, or if the second husband dies,
\v 4 then the former first husband may not marry her again, because she has been defiled. The LORD really hates that deed! Don't bring sin that is disgusting like that on the land that the LORD God gives to you!"
\s1 Some other rules
\p
\v 5 "A man who is newly married may not be sent to war or be burdened with other general tasks. He must be allowed to live at home for a year to make his wife happy.
\p
\v 6 "Don't take a wheat grinding stone as debt security, because the owner needs that object to make flour for bread, so that his family may eat.
\p
\v 7 If a person kidnaps his fellow Israelite and makes him his slave or sells him, the kidnapper must be sentenced to die. In that way, you eradicate evil like that from among you all.
\p
\v 8 "If a person suffers from a skin disease that is contagious, be careful to perform all of the instructions from the Levite priests. Obey the commands which I've given to you.
\v 9 Remember what the LORD God had down to Miriam\f + \fr 24:9 \fk what the LORD God had done to Miriam. \ft See Num. 12:1-6 \f* when you all were on your journey out of Egypt.
\p
\v 10 "When you give a debt to a person, don't enter his house to take his possessions as security.
\v 11 Stand outside of his house and allow he himself to get the security possession and surrender it to you.
\v 12 But if that person is poor so that he only can give you his warm robe as security, don't keep his security possession until night.
\v 13 As soon as the sun sets, return his warm robe to him, so that he can use it when he sleeps. If you do that thing, he will be grateful because of your kind-heartedness and ask the LORD to bless you, so that the LORD God is pleased with you.
\p
\v 14 Don't oppress the wage earner who is poor and destitute, whether he is a fellow Israelite or a foreigner that lives in your city.
\v 15 Pay his wages everyday before the sun sets because he is poor and needs it. If you don't do that and he cries to the LORD about your actions toward him, then you will bear the sin for your deeds.
\p
\v 16 "A father cannot be sentenced to die because of evil done by his boy children. And a boy child can not be setenced to die because of evil done by his father. Only the doer of great evil can be sentenced to die.
\p
\v 17 "Treat the foreigner and orphan child fairly. Don't whatsoever take the clothing of a widow as security for her debt.
\v 18 Remember that you all formerly had been slaves in Egypt and the LORD God freed all of you from there. That's why I gave these commands to all of you.
\p
\v 19 "When you plant your field and accidentally leave a bundle of wheat in the field, don't return to get it. Leave it for the foreigner, the orphan child, and widows. If you do that, the LORD God will bless you in all things that you do.
\v 20 When you pick olives in your garden, don't return to get the remaining fruit. Leave the fruit for the foreigner, the orphan child, and the widow.
\v 21 In that way, at the time you pick your grapes in your vineyard, don't return to pick grapes that were left. Leave the grapes for the foreigner, the orphan child, and the widow.
\v 22 Remember that you formerly lived as slaves in Egypt. That's why I order you to be kind-hearted to people who have needs.
