\c 13
\s Warning against idol worship
\p
\v 1 Imagine a situation like this: A person claiming himself to be a prophet, or someone who can foretell miracles based on his dreams appears among you. Then that person foretells a miracle,
\v 2 and what he foretells comes true. If then he invites you, ‘Let us worship and serve gods’— that is the false gods that you do not know yet—
\v 3 do not listen to him! This happens because the LORD your GOd is tensting you to know whether you love Him with your whole heart and soul or not.
\v 4 The LORD your God is the only One you must follow and respect, and also obey His commands and listen to His voice. Serve Him and hold to Him only.
\v 5 But the previously mentioned person who claimed himself to be a prophet must be given death punishment, because he taught you to rebel against the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery. He invited you to leave the way of life that the LORD your God commanded (you). Kill a person like that! Because by doing that you will destroy that evilness from among you.
\p
\v 6 “Or imaging that your relative or your son, your daughter, your wife, or your close friend, quietly invited you to worship gods (that is false gods that you do not know or your ancestors do not know,
\v 7 even gods from nations around you, whether nations that live near you or far from you),
\v 8 do not listen to him or even be influenced by him. And do not conceal their doings because of pity towards him.
\v 9 That person must be given death punishment! Your own hands must be the first one to give the punishment, then followed by other people.
\v 10 You have to stone him with stone until he die, because he already tried to make you turn away from the LORD your God, who has brought you out of slavery in Egypt
\v 11 The purpose of this punishment is so that the whole Israel will listen and become afraid, so that no one will do the same evilness again among you.
\p
\v 12 Or imaging that you heard news about a resident in one of the cities that the LORD your God will give to you,
\v 13 that there are rebellious people there who have misled the residents of that city by saying, ‘Let us worship the gods’ (that is the false gods that you do not know),
\v 14 then you have to investigate the matter carefully. If the incident has been proven to be true, and the evil doings has certainly been done among your cities,
\v 15 then all the residents of that city must be killed by sword. According to the investigation, all people and wealth in that city is set to be destroyed. That means that all the residents and even all the livestocks must be killed by sword.
\v 16 Then you must gather the spoils of the city and bring them to the city square, then burn the city and its spoils, so that the city resembles a burnt sacrifice to the LORD your God. Let that city be rubbles forever, and it may not be rebuilt.
\v 17 Do not continue to hold any wealth from the spoils that has been set to be destroyed! Everything must be destroyed, so that the LORD will not be angry with you anymore, and that He will love and pity you. Then He will make your descendants many, according to His covenant to our ancestors.
\v 18 That is why I affirm: You must obey all the LORD’s commands that I taught you today and do all that is right according to His view.”
