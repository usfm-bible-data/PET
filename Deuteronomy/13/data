\c 13
\s Warning about idolatry
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “One day, something like this might happen: A false prophet or fortune teller appears among you, and based on his dream, he predicts a sign,
\v 2 and then the prediction happened. Then when he invites you, 'Let us worship and serve the gods,' that is, the gods our nation has never worshiped,
\v 3 don't listen to him! This is happening because the LORD your God is testing you to see if you love Him with all your heart and breath.
\v 4 You alone must worship, serve, respect, listen, and obey. Hold on to Him only.
\v 5 But that false prophet or fortune teller must be put to death because he has invited you to rebel against the LORD your God, who brought us out of the land of Egypt and redeemed us from slavery. This false prophet invites you to turn away from the right way of living before the LORD, so that such a person must be eliminated in order to eradicate this evil from among the people of Israel.
\p
\v 6 “Do not listen to or be influenced by anyone who secretly invites you to worship the gods, be it your close friends, brothers, children, even your wife whom you love so much. This prohibition applies to all kinds of gods, including gods that have never been worshiped by our nation,
\v 7 and the gods who are worshiped by the nations around you, both near and far.
\v 8 You should not be influenced or listen to anyone who invites you to worship a god. And you also shouldn't keep his actions a secret or protect him out of pity for him.
\v 9-10 This person was to be put to death by stoning. And you, as those who witness his rebellion against the LORD, must be the first to stone him. Then the other people must stone him to death. This is the punishment that shall be imposed on anyone who tries to make you leave the LORD your God who brought you out of bondage in Egypt.
\v 11 In this way, all Israel heard and was afraid, so that there would be no more people doing such crimes among you.
\p
\v 12 “When you hear the news that it is in one of the cities that the LORD will give you
\v 13 there are disobedient people who have misled their inhabitants, by inviting them to worship gods that have never been worshiped by our nation,
\v 14 You must investigate this carefully. If the news is proven true, and the crime did occur,
\v 15 then you must destroy the city and all its inhabitants, and all their livestock must be killed.
\v 16 Then you must collect all the plunder from the city and bring it to the town square. Burn both the city and the spoil to it, so that it will be like a burnt offering to the LORD. Let the city be in ruins forever and may not be rebuilt.
\v 17 You must not keep any of the loot that is already set to be destroyed. That way, God will no longer be angry with our nation. He will reveal His kindness and make your descendants very numerous, according to His promise that He passed to our ancestors.
\v 18 This blessing from the LORD will only come true if you obey all His commandments that I teach today and do what is right in His sight.
