\c 19
\s1 Protection cities
\p
\v 1 "After the LORD God does away with the nations from the land that He gives to you, and when you have driven them out from their cities and begin to live in their houses,
\v 2-3 you must divide the land that the LORD gives to you into three districts. Then choose a city in the middle of each district as a protection city. A person who unintentionally kills another person can run away to the closest protection city.
\p
\v 4 "When a person unintentionally kills another person who is not his enemy, then the murder can run away to one of the protection cities and live there.
\v 5 For example, if two friends go to the woors to cut down a tree, and then the head of the axe of one person gets loose from its handle when he is felling the tree, then it hits his friend and kills him, then the murderer may run to a protection city.
\p
\v 6 "If the protection city is too far, then a close family member who feels the right to avenge the death can chase the murdered and in anger immediately kill him before there is opportunity for his case to be tried. That thing [isn't just//in that way justice]
\v 7

\v 8-9
\v 10
\p
\v 11
\v 12 then the elders of that city of his residence must send a group to the protection city to bring him home. After that they must surrender him to the family member who has the right to demand revenge, so that he is killed.
\v 13
\s1 Prohibition to move land boundary signs
\p
\v 14 "After you possess the land that the LORD is giving to the descendants of Israel, don't move the land ownership boundaries of your fellowman that have been determined for a long time."
\s Rules regarding witnesses and false accusations
\p
\v 15 "One witness only isn't enough to declare an accused person is guilty. A judge can only decide a case if there are two or three witnesses that verify the accusation.
\p
\v 16 "If there is a case where there is conjecture that a person gave false accusation toward his fellowman,
\v 17 then that case must be brought to the priests and judges who are on duty before the LORD in the place for worshiping Him.
\v 18 The judges will examine the case with great care. If the judges decide that the person who accuses his fellowman is clearly lying,
\v 19 the liar has to be punished in the exact same demanded punishment that he wanted to befall his fellowman that he slandered.
\v 20 In that way all of the people will hear what happened to the liar, then no one will be brave to give false accusations again.
\v 21 After the court gives a decision, you all may not pity the person whom the punishment falls on. The rule is this:
\li2 The person who blinds the eye of his fellowman must have his own eye blinded.
\li2 The person who breaks the tooth of his fellowman must have his own tooth broken.
\li2 The person who breaks the arm of his fellowman must have his own arm broken.
\li2 The person who cuts the leg of his fellowman must have his leg broken.
\li2 And the person who kills his fellowman must be killed."
