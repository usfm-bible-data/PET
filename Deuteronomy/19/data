\s1 Cities of refuge\x + \xo 19:1 \xt Num. 35:9-34; Jos. 20:1-9\x*
\p
\v 1 Then Moses taught the people of Israel, “After the LORD God has cut off the nations from the land that He will soon give to you, and when you have driven them out of their cities and settled in their homes,
\v 2-3 you must divide the land into three regions. Then select a city in the middle of each area as a city of refuge. The person who killed accidentally could escape to a nearby city of refuge.
\p
\v 4 “These are the rules for accidental death. If someone accidentally kills another person, not out of hostility, then that killer can flee to one of the cities of refuge and live there.
\v 5 For example, if two friends go to the forest to cut a tree, then the ax of the ax of the other person falls from his hilt while he is cutting, then falls on his friend and dies, then the owner of the ax may run to one of the cities of refuge.
\v 6 If the city of refuge is too far away, it could be that a family member of the victim who feels they have the right to sue for blood can chase after the person and angrily kill him before his case is tried. It was unfair because he did not antagonize his victim and accidentally caused his death.
\v 7 That is why I command you to choose three cities.
\p
\v 8-9 "If you do every thing that I command you today - that is to love the LORD our God and live your life as He wants - then the LORD will expand your territory until He gives the whole land that He promised to our ancestors. After that happens, you must choose three more cities as cities of refuge.
\v 10 Do this so that the blood of innocent people may not be spilled in the land that the LORD has given you, and that you do not bear sin for it.
\p
\v 11 "On the other hand, for cases of deliberate murder, for example a person hates his fellow man, then he hides and waits for the person he hates, then kills him, then the killer cannot be protected. If he fled to one of the cities of refuge,
\v 12 the leaders of the city where he lived were to send a party to the city of refuge to bring him home. After that they had to hand him over to a family member of the victim who had the right to demand blood so that he would be killed.
\v 13 You must not spare a murderer. The Israelites must account for the crime of shedding the blood of an innocent person so that you may always live in prosperity."
\s1 Restrictions on removing land markers
\p
\v 14 “When you are living in the land that the LORD will give to you, the land will be divided. And you will pass the land to your descendants. Therefore, don't harm your neighbor's family by moving the land boundary mark that has been determined since the time of the first distribution."
\s Regulations concerning false witnesses and accusations
\p
\v 15 “A witness alone is not sufficient to find an accused guilty. A judge can only decide a case if there are two or three witnesses who confirm the allegations.
\p
\v 16 "If your neighbor Israel falsely accuses you,
\v 17 then the matter is to be brought to the priests and judges who are serving before the LORD in his tabernacle.
\v 18 The judges will investigate the matter carefully. If it is proven that the accuser really lied about you,
\v 19-20 he will have to be subject to the same punishment that he wants to bring upon you. In this way, all the people would hear and be afraid of making false accusations, so that such crimes would not happen again among the people of Israel.
\v 21 After the judge gives a decision, you must not feel sorry for the person who is being sentenced. The rules are:
\li2 One who has blinded the eyes of his neighbor must be blinded himself.
\li2 One who breaks the teeth of his neighbor must break his own teeth.
\li2 The person who cuts off the hands of others must have his own hands cut off.
\li2 The person who cuts the legs of his neighbor must have his own legs cut off.
\li2 And he who kills his neighbor must be killed."
