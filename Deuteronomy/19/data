\s1 Cities of refuge\x + \xo 19:1 \xt Num. 35:9-34; Jos. 20:1-9\x*
\p
\v 1 Then Moses taught the people of Israel, “After the LORD God has cut off the nations from the land that He will soon give to you, and when you have driven them out of their cities and settled in their homes,
\v 2-3 you must divide the land into three regions. Then select a city in the middle of each area as a city of refuge. A person who kills someone accidentally can escape to a nearby city of refuge.
\p
\v 4 “These are the rules for a case of accidental death. If someone accidentally kills another person, not out of hostility, then the killer can flee to one of the cities of refuge and stay there.
\v 5 For example, if two friends go to the forest to cut a tree, and an axe head comes off its handle while he is cutting, and hits his friend so that he dies, then the owner of the axe may flee to one of the cities of refuge.
\v 6 If the city of refuge is too far away, it's possible that a family member of the victim who feels they have the right to demand blood can chase after the person and kill him out of anger before his case is tried. That is unfair because he did not have enmity toward his victim and did not intentionally cause his death.
\v 7 That is why I command you to choose three cities.
\p
\v 8-9 "If you do every thing that I command you today - that is to love the LORD our God and live your life as He desires - then the LORD will expand your territory until He gives the whole land that He promised to our ancestors to you. After that happens, you must choose three more cities as cities of refuge.
\v 10 Do this so that the blood of innocent people is not spilled in the land that the LORD is giving you, and so that you do not bear sin for it.
\p
\v 11 "Conversely, for cases of deliberate murder, for example a person hates his fellow man, and he hides and waits for the person he hates, then kills him, then the killer cannot be protected. If he flees to one of the cities of refuge,
\v 12 the leaders of the city where he lives must send a party to the city of refuge to bring him home. After that they must hand him over to a family member of the victim who has the right to demand blood so that he is killed.
\v 13 You must not spare a murderer. The Israelites must account for the crime of shedding the blood of an innocent person so that you may always live in prosperity."
\s1 Restrictions on removing land markers
\p
\v 14 “When you are already living in the land that the LORD will soon give to you, the land will be divided. And you will give the land to your descendants as an inheritance. Therefore, don't harm your neighbor's family by moving the land boundary marker that has already been determined since the time of the first division."
\s Regulations concerning false witnesses and accusations
\p
\v 15 “A single witness is not sufficient to find an accused person guilty. A judge can only decide a case if there are two or three witnesses who confirm the allegations.
\p
\v 16 "If your Israelite neighbor falsely accuses you,
\v 17 then the matter is to be brought to the priests and judges who are serving before the LORD at His tabernacle.
\v 18 The judges will investigate the matter carefully. If it is proven that the accuser really lied about you,
\v 19-20 he must be afflicted with the same punishment that he wanted to bring upon you. In this way, all the people will hear and be afraid of making false accusations, so that such crimes will not happen again among the people of Israel.
\v 21 After the judge gives a decision, you must not feel sorry for the person who is being sentenced. The rules are:
\li2 One who blinds the eyes of his neighbor must be blinded himself.
\li2 One who breaks the teeth of his neighbor, his own teeth must be broken.
\li2 One who cuts off his neighbor's hand, must have his own hand cut off.
\li2 One who cuts off the foot of his neighbor, must have his own foot cut off.
\li2 And one who kills his neighbor must be killed."
