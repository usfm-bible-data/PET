\s1 The Celebrations of Easter and Unleavened Bread\x + \xo 16:1 \xt Exod. 12; Lev. 23:5-8; Num. 28:16-25\x*
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, "According to the commandment of the LORD your God, celebrate the Passover every year, on the fourteenth day of the month Abib,\f + \fr 16:1 \fk Abib \ft The name of the first month in the Jewish calendar, common starting from March 21 to April 21. Abib was then called by the name of the month of Nisan after the Israelites returned from exile in Assyria.\f* because it was on that night that the LORD brought us out of slavery in Egypt.
\v 2 As a Passover sacrifice to the LORD, offer up a bull, ram, or male goat in the tabernacle of the LORD, which is to be built in the place which he chooses.
\v 3 The sacrificial meat should not be eaten with leavened bread. During the seven days of the Passover celebration, you must eat unleavened bread, which is called the 'Bread of Suffering'. That way, for the rest of your life you will remember how the Israelites got out of Egypt in a hurry.
\v 4 During those seven days, let no one in the whole land store leaven. And the meat of the Passover sacrificial animal which is cut off on the first Easter Vigil is to be eaten up that night. If there is anything left, then the meat must be burned thoroughly before morning.\f + \fr 16:4 \fk If there is any leftover ... \ft This sentence is accompanied by information from Ex. 12:10. The Hebrew in this verse does not mention how to finish the rest of the meat.\f*
\p
\v 5-6 “Celebrate the Passover in the tabernacle of the LORD, which will be erected in the place He has appointed. You may not offer the Passover sacrifice anywhere, such as in the city where you live. Offer the Passover sacrifice at sunset, just as you came out of Egypt.
\v 7 Cook and eat the meat that was sacrificed in the tabernacle of the LORD. Then the next morning you may go back to your tents. The Israelites were to celebrate the Passover where the LORD's tent was located, so they pitched tents to stay there for the festival period, which is eight days. The word 'tent' can also be interpreted more generically as the 'place to live' each.\f* respectively.
\v 8 After the celebration of the first day, for the next six days, eat unleavened bread. Then on the seventh day you must all gather again to worship and honor the LORD. You may not do any work on that day."
\s Harvest Festival\x + \xo 16:9 \xt Lev. 23:9-14; Num. 28:26-31\x*
\p
\v 9 "To determine the start date of the Feast of the Harvest, count seven weeks from the first day of harvesting the barley.\f + \fr 16:9 \fk barley \ft The Hebrew text does not mention the type of grain harvested, but according to Ruth 2:23, barley is harvested first, then wheat.\f*
\v 10 Then, celebrate the Harvest Festival\f + \fr 16:10 \fk The Harvest Festival \ft The Hebrew text literally lists the name of this holiday, 'feast (meal) of the week (plural)'. At Exodus 23:16 this feast is called the Harvest Festival, and in the NT it is called Pentecost, which in Greek means '50th (day).'\f* in honor of the LORD your God, by bringing voluntary offerings to Him according to the abundance of the harvest which the LORD has given you.
\v 11 At that time rejoice before the LORD in his tabernacle. Celebrate together with your children and slaves, both boys and girls. Also invite the inhabitants of your city who are from the tribe of Levi, migrants, orphans, and widows.
\v 12 Let our experience as slaves in Egypt be an encouragement for us to keep carefully obeying all the commandments of the LORD that I teach. "
\s Feast of Leafy Branches\x + \xo 16:13 \xt Lev. 23:33-43; Num. 29:12-39\x*
\p
\v 13 “At the end of the harvest season, after you have stored the wheat and pressed the wine, you must celebrate the Feast of Leafy Branches for seven days.
\v 14 This feast should be celebrated with joy by every family with children and all slaves, both male and female. Also invite the inhabitants of your city who are from the tribe of Levi, migrants, orphans, and widows.
\v 15 Honor the LORD your God by celebrating this for seven days in the tabernacle of the LORD. All of you will surely rejoice, because the LORD will bless your crops and all your other efforts.
\p
\v 16 “So, three times a year all the males of the Israelites were to gather before the LORD in His tabernacle to celebrate these three festivals:Passover, Harvest Day, and Feast of Leafy Branches. Don't let anyone come without an offering,
\v 17 and according to the many blessings you have received from the LORD, this gift is given.
\s Judges must be fair
\p
\v 18 “Appoint judges and leaders for every tribe in all the cities that the LORD God will give to you. Judges and leaders must judge and lead fairly.
\v 19 Whenever making a decision, they should not take sides and are prohibited from accepting bribes. Because bribery blinds people to the truth, even wise people, they are no longer able to make fair decisions.
\p
\v 20 And this also applies to all of God's people! Let everyone among us always act fairly, so that you may remain in the land that the LORD will give to you soon.”
\s Prohibition of worshiping gods
\p
\v 21 “By the altar of the LORD your God do not build a wooden pillar which is the symbol of the goddess Asherah
\v 22 nor a stone pillar to worship any god, for the LORD your God hates such pillars."
