\s1 The Passover and Bread Without Yeast celebrations
\p
\v 1 “According to the command of the LORD your God, celebrate the Passover in the month of Abib,\f + \fr 16:1 \fk Abib \ft Abib is the first month in the calendar of the Jews, usually starting form March 21st through April 21st. Abib was later also called the month of Nisan after the Israelites returned from exile in Assyria.\f* Because on one night in that month the LORD brought us out from salvery in Egypt.
\v 2 Sacrifice a male animal from your flocks goats, sheep or your cows as a Passover sacrifice [to the LORD your God] in the place of worship that is chosen by the LORD your God.
\v 3 The meat of that sacrifice may not be eaten with leavened bread. You have to eat bread [that is not leavened, which also is called 'Bread of Suffering',//which is not leavened for seven days, [so that as long as you live you will remember the day when//so that you remember how] we left [slavery in//land] of Egypt in a hurry. [0//That bread is called the 'Bread of Suffering'. By eating that bread for seven days, as long as you live you will remember how much we suffered in the time of slavery in Egypt.]
\v 4 For seven days, [a person may not//not one person may] keep yeast [o//in the house, or] anywhere in all the land. The meat of the Passover animal sacrifice that is butchered on the first night, must be eaten completely on that night too. If there is any leftover, then that meat must be burned completely before morning.\f + \fr 16:4 \fk If there is any leftover\ft The meaning of this sentence is completed by information from Ex. 12:10. The Hebrew language doesn't state the way the meat was to be destroyed.\f*

\v 6 [except//Respect the LORD your God by butchering the animal sacrifice of Passover] in the place He lives, \f + \fr 16:6 \fk ta \ft Se.\f*
