\s1 The Passover and Bread Without Yeast celebrations
\p
\v 1 “According to the command of the LORD your God, celebrate the Passover in the month of Abib,\f + \fr 16:1 \fk Abib \ft Abib is the first month in the calendar of the Jews, usually starting form March 21st through April 21st. Abib was later also called the month of Nisan after the Israelites returned from exile in Assyria.\f* Because on one night in that month the LORD brought us out from salvery in Egypt.
\v 2 As a Passover sacrifice for the LORD, sacrifice a male cow, male sheep, or male goat in the place of worship that will be chosen by the LORD your God.
\v 3 The meat of that sacrifice may not be eaten with leavened bread. You must eat bread that has not been leavened during the seven days of the aforementioned celebration. This bread can also be called 'Bread of Suffering’. By eating that bread for seven days, as long as you live you will remember how much we suffered in the time of slavery in Egypt.
\v 4 For seven days, no one person is permitted to save yeast in any place in all the land. The meat of the Passover animal sacrifice that is butchered on the first night must be eaten completely on that night also. If there is any leftover, that meat must be burned up before morning.\f + \fr 16:4 \fk If there is any leftover \ft The meaning of this sentence is completed by information from Ex. 12:10. The Hebrew of this verse does not state the way the meat was to be destroyed.\f*
\p
\v 5 “When the LORD your God gives you a place to live in some city, you may not offer the Passover there.
\v 6 Celebrate the Passover at the place of the LORD’s dwelling\f + \fr 16:6 \fk the LORD’s dwelling \ft Literally, ‘the place for making His name dwell there’. The word ‘His name’ here is a figure (metonymy) which refers to all of His personhood. Included in the meaning of this figure is also that the aforementioned place will become the center where the LORD is honored and worshipped.\f*— which is the place which will have been decided by the LORD as the place for worshipping Him. Sacrifice Passover sacrifice at the moment the sun sets, at the (same) moment you (pl) left Egypt.
\v 7 Cook and eat the meat of that sacrifice at the place that the LORD your God will have chosen. Then on the next morning, return to your individual living places.
\v 8 During the next six days, eat bread that is unleavened. Then on the seventh day you must hold a big worship (service) to worship and honor the LORD. You are not permitted to do any work whatever on that day.”
\s The Harvest Celebration
\p
\v 9 “Count seven weeks starting from the first day you start to harvest the barley or wheat.
\v 10 Then, celebrate the Harvest Celebration\f + \fr 16:10 \fk Harvest Celebration \ft Literally, ‘(eating) party (seven) weeks’. In Exodus 23:16 the aforementioned feast is called Harvest Celebration, and in the NT it is called Pentacost, which in Greek means ‘the 50th (day)’.\f* to honor the LORD your God by taking a free-will offering to Him according to the amount of the harvest the LORD has given to you.
\v 11 At that time rejoice in the LORD’s presence at the worship place He will have chosen. Celebrate (it) together with your children and slaves— including both male and female. Invite also the descendants of the Levites who live in your town, aliens/new-comers, orphans, and widows.
\v 12 Let our experience as slaves in Egypt become an incentive for us to continue to obey all the commands of LORD your God which I am teaching.’
\s The Celebration of leafy shelters
\p
\v 13 “At the end of every harvest season, after you store the grain and press your grapes, you must celebrate the Feast of Leafy Shelters for seven days.
\v 14 This feast must be celebrated with full rejoicing by every family together with their children and all slaves— both male and female. Invite also the descendants of the Levites who live in your town, aliens/new-comers, orphans, and widows.
\p
\v 15 Honor the LORD you God in this celebration for seven days at the place that the LORD will have chosen as the place for worshipping Him. You and all the people with you will certainly rejoice, because the LORD will have blessed your harvest and all your other work which you have done.
\p
\v 16 “So, three times per year all the men of the nation of Israel must gather before the LORD your God at the place which He chooses as the place for worshipping Him to celebrate these three celebrations: Passover, the Harvest Celebration, and the Feast of Leafy Shelters. It must not happen that a man comes without bringing an offering.
\v 17 You each must give an offering according to the blessing which the LORD your God has given to you.”

\p
\v 18 “Appoint judges and leaders for each of your tribes, in every city of the land which the LORD our God is giving to us. Those judges and leaders must judge fairly.
\v 19 In making decisions, the judges and leaders are not permitted to take sides/show favoritism and are forbidden to take bribes. Because bribes blind even a wise person towards the truth, so that they are no longer able to give just decisions.
\p
\v 20 But let it be that each of you always behave fairly, so that you can live long from generation to generation in the land which the LORD your God will give you.”
\s The prohibition of worshiping deities
\p
\v 21 “Beside the LORD your God’s altar do not set up a wooden pillar as a symbol of the Ashera deity.
\v 22 And do not set up a stone pillar for worshipping any deity whatever, because the LORD your God exceedingly hates pillars like that.”
