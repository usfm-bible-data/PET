\s1 The Festivals of Passover and Unleavened Bread\x + \xo 16:1 \xt Exod. 12; Lev. 23:5-8; Num. 28:16-25\x*
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, "According to the commandment of the LORD your God, celebrate the Passover every year, on the fourteenth day of the month of Abib,\f + \fr 16:1 \fk Abib \ft The name of the first month in the Jewish calendar, usually beginning on March 21 and lasting until April 21. Abib was later referred to by the name of the month of Nisan after the Israelites returned from exile in Assyria.\f* because it was on that night that the LORD brought us out of slavery in Egypt.
\v 2 As a Passover sacrifice to the LORD, offer up a bull, ram, or male goat at the tabernacle of the LORD, which is to be built in the place He chooses.
\v 3 The sacrificial meat should not be eaten with leavened bread. During the seven days of the Passover celebration, you must eat unleavened bread, which is called the 'Bread of Suffering'. That way, for the rest of your life you will remember how the Israelites left Egypt in a hurry.
\v 4 During those seven days, let no one in all the land store leaven. And the meat of the sacrificial animal of Passover that is slaughtered on the first night of Passover is to be eaten entirely that night. If there is any leftover, then the meat must be burned thoroughly before morning.\f + \fr 16:4 \fk If there is any leftover... \ft This sentence is accompanied by information from Ex. 12:10. The Hebrew in this verse does not mention how to get rid of the leftover meat.\f*
\p
\v 5-6 “Celebrate the Passover at the tabernacle of the LORD, which will be erected in the place He appoints. You may not offer the Passover sacrifice anywhere, such as in the city where you live. Offer the Passover sacrifice at sunset, just like when you left Egypt.
\v 7 Cook and eat the meat that is sacrificed at the tabernacle of the LORD. Then the next morning you may go back to each of your tents.\f + \fr 16:7 \fk your tents \ft The Israelites were to celebrate the Passover where the LORD's tabernacle was located, so they pitched tents to stay there during the festival period, namely eight days. The word 'tent' can also be interpreted more generically as each one's 'place of residence'.\f*
\v 8 After the celebration on the first day, for the next six days, eat unleavened bread. Then on the seventh day you must all gather again to worship and honor the LORD. You may not do any work on that day."
\s The Feast of the Harvest\x + \xo 16:9 \xt Lev. 23:9-14; Num. 28:26-31\x*
\p
\v 9 "To determine the start date of the Feast of the Harvest, count seven weeks from the first day of harvesting barley.\f + \fr 16:9 \fk barley \ft The Hebrew text does not mention the type of grain harvested, but according to Ruth 2:23, barley was harvested first, then wheat.\f*
\v 10 Then, celebrate the Feast of the Harvest\f + \fr 16:10 \fk The Feast of the Harvest \ft The Hebrew text literally writes the name of this feast, 'feast (meal) of weeks (plural)'. In Exodus 23:16 this feast is called the Feast of the Harvest, and in the NT it is called Pentecost, which in Greek means '50th (day).'\f* in honor of the LORD your God, by bringing voluntary offerings to Him according to the abundance of the harvest which the LORD has given you.
\v 11 At that time rejoice before the LORD at his tabernacle. Celebrate together with your children and slaves, both male and female. Also invite the inhabitants of your city who are from the tribe of Levi, migrants, orphans, and widows.
\v 12 Let our experience as slaves in Egypt be an encouragement for us to continue carefully obeying all the commandments of the LORD that I teach."
\s The Feast of Leafy Branches\x + \xo 16:13 \xt Lev. 23:33-43; Num. 29:12-39\x*
\p
\v 13 “At the end of the harvest season, after you have stored the wheat and pressed the wine, you must celebrate the Feast of Leafy Branches for seven days.
\v 14 This feast should be celebrated with joy by each family with their children and all their slaves, both male and female. Also invite the inhabitants of your city who are from the tribe of Levi, migrants, orphans, and widows.
\v 15 Honor the LORD your God by celebrating this for seven days at the tabernacle of the LORD. All of you will surely rejoice, because the LORD will bless your crops and all your other efforts.
\p
\v 16 “So, three times a year all Israelite males must gather before the LORD at His tabernacle to celebrate these three festivals: Passover, the Feast of the Harvest, and the Feast of Leafy Branches. Don't let anyone come without an offering,
\v 17 and that offering is given according to the many blessings you have received from the LORD.
\s Judges must be fair
\p
\v 18 “Appoint judges and leaders for every tribe in all the cities that the LORD God will give to you. Judges and leaders must judge and lead fairly.
\v 19 Whenever making a decision, they should not take sides and are prohibited from accepting bribes. For bribery blinds people to the truth, even wise people, so that they are no longer able to make fair decisions.
\p
\v 20 And this also applies to all of the LORD's people! Everyone among us should always act fairly, so that you may remain in the land that the LORD will give to you soon.”
\s Prohibition of worshiping gods
\p
\v 21 “By the altar of the LORD your God do not build a wooden pillar, the symbol of the goddess Asherah,
\v 22 nor a stone pillar to worship any god, for the LORD your God hates such pillars."
