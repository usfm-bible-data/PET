\s Clean and unclean animals\f +14:1 \fk Animal names \ft In this chapter, the Hebrew language for several types of animals cannot be ascertained in Indonesian, and some types are also difficult to distinguish in Indonesian. Another chapter that teaches about clean and unclean animals is Lev. 11.\f*
\p
\v 1-2 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, "From among all the nations of the world, the LORD your God has chosen us to be a people sanctified by Him.\f + \fr 14:1 \fk a people sanctified by Him \ft Literally, verse 1 begins with, 'You are sons of the LORD your God', and verse 2 starts with, 'because you are a holy people'.\f* So, as a people set apart as His possession let us not live like the nations that do not know the LORD. For example, when you mourn someone who has died, do not do like the other nations, that is, injure themselves or shave the front of their heads.
\p
\v 3 “Do not eat anything that the LORD declares to be unclean.
\v 4 These are the kinds of animals whose meat you are allowed to eat:
\li2 cows, sheep, goats,
\li2
\v 5 deer, gazelle, roe deer,
\li2 forest goats, mountain goats, and forest sheep.
\p
\v 6 “Any animal whose hoof is split in half and chews the cud may be eaten.
\v 7 However, you should not eat animals such as camels, rabbits and guinea pigs, because even though they chew the cud, their hooves are not split.
\v 8 Pigs are also unclean to eat, because even if their hooves are split in two, they do not chew the cud. Don't eat their meat or touch their carcass.
\p
\v 9 "You may eat any kind of fish that has scales and fins,
\v 10 while other animals that live in the water but do not have scales or fins, you must not eat. If you eat them, you will become unclean before the LORD.
\p
\v 11 "You may eat the meat of birds that the LORD declares to be clean.
\v 12-18 These are the bird species\f + \fr 14:12-18 \fk bird species \ft in the original language, many of the names on this list are unknown. In general, meat-eating birds are declared unclean.\f* whose meat you are not allowed to eat:
\li2 great eagles, vultures, all kinds of eagles,
\li2 all kinds of crows,
\li2 ostriches, owls of all kinds, seagulls, pelicans, storks, woodpeckers and bats.
\p
\v 19 “Do not eat winged insects that move by walking.
\v 20 But winged insects that move by jumping are clean and may be eaten.\f + \fr 14:20 \fk meaning of verse 20 \ft Literally, "(those that) have wings which are clean you may eat." The TSI completes the meaning of this verse with information from Lev. 11:20-23. There are also translations that interpret this verse as a bird, not an insect.\f*
\p
\v 21 “Do not eat the carcass of an animal that died on its own, because the animal's blood was not removed. You can give or sell the carcass to the foreigners who live among you, and let them eat it. But do not eat it yourself, for you are set apart as the LORD's people, whom He has sanctified to be His own.
\p Do not cook lamb or mutton in its mother's milk."
\s Tithing
\p
\v 22 “Once a year you shall separate one-tenth of all your crops.
\v 23 Take the tithe to the tabernacle of the LORD, which will be built later in the place that He appoints. Enjoy the various foods of your tithe there, such as wheat, olive oil, and new wine, as well as the meat of each of your first-born livestock. By doing these things, you will learn to always fear and honor the LORD.
\p
\v 24 "If the tabernacle of the LORD is too far from your house, so that you cannot carry a tithe from the blessing of the LORD your God there, then
\v 25 sell a tithe from the result of your work, and bring the money to the city where the tabernacle of the LORD is located.
\v 26 In that city, feel free to buy whatever you want to be offered and enjoyed together at the tabernacle of the LORD, such as cows, sheep, wine, or beer. There you will eat and drink with joy with your family before the LORD.
\v 27 Do not forget to invite the Levites who live in your city, because they do not get a share of the land like you.
\p
\v 28 "At the end of every three years,\f + \fr 14:28 \fk At the end of every three years \ft The Israelites divided their time into counts of three years according to the timetable for the Sabbath Year, which occurred every seven years. In every seven year count, there are two triennial celebrations. Then the count for the next three years began again after the Sabbath Year. In the first and second years, the tithe was brought to the tabernacle of the LORD. But every third year the tithe was devoted to helping the needs of the local city. The Sabbath year is discussed in the next chapter.\f* bring a tithe of your harvest that year to the granary of your city to be stored there.
\v 29 This provision is for the aid of the inhabitants of your city who are from the tribe of Levi, because they do not have a share of the land like you. Apart from them, let this provision also help the migrants, orphans and widows who live in your city. Such people may come to the storeroom and collect as needed. Do this so that the LORD your God will bless you in all your endeavors."
