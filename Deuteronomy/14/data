\c 14
\s Clean and unclean animal\f +14:1 \fk names of animals \ft In this chapter, the names in the Hebrew language for several kinds of animals cannot be confirmed, and a few kinds are also difficult to differentiate in the Indonesian language.\f*
\p
\v 1 “We are the chosen people of the LORD our God. So, when mourning for people who have died, we should not be the same as other nations who cut themselves or shave their hair on the front part of their heads.
\v 2 Because from among all nations on earth the LORD your God has chosen us to be His chosen people and people who are purified by Him and for Him. So we should not live like nations that don’t know the LORD.
\p
\v 3 “Don’t eat anything that the LORD declares to be unclean.
\v 4 These are the kinds of animals whose meat you may eat:
\li2 cow, sheep, goat
\li2
\v 5 deer, gazelle, mountain goat, mountain sheep, menjangan?, and wild goat.
\p
\v 6 “Every animal whose hooves are split [two//become just two parts] and ruminates may be eaten.
\v 7 However, you may not eat animals like camels, rabbits, and marmot, because even though they ruminate their hooves are not split.
\v 8 And pigs are unclean to be eaten, because even though their hooves are split in two, pigs do not ruminate. Don’t eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
\p
\v 9 “You may eat any kind of fish that has scales and fins,
\v 10 but don’t eat other animals that live in the water that don't have scales and fins. If you eat them then you will be unclean before the LORD.
\p
\v 11 “You may eat the meat of birds that are clean for the LORD.
\v 12-18 But these are the kinds of birds whose meat you may not eat:
\li2 the eagle, the vulture, the osprey,
\li2 eagle, swallow, all kinds of crows
\li2 ostrich, the seagull, the owl,
\li2 the vulture, falcon, the undan bird
\li2 the heron, and the bat.
\p
\v 19 “Don’t eat the kinds of insects with wings that can walk on the ground.
\v 20 But winged insects that move by jumping are clean and may be eaten.\f + \fr 14:20 \fk meaning of verse 20 \ft Literally, “(the ones) with wings are clean and you may eat them.” TSI supplemented the intended meaning of this verse with information from Lev 11:20-23. There are also some translations that understand this verse is intended for birds not insects.\f*
\p
\v 21 “Don’t eat the carcass of an animal that dies by itself, because the blood of that animal wasn't taken out. You may give or sell the carcass to foreigners that live among you, and let them eat it. But you can’t you eat it, because you are the people of the LORD who are sanctified by Him and for Him.
\p Don’t cook the meat of a lamb or kid in its mother’s milk.”
\s Giving tithes
\p
\v 22 “Once a year you must separate a tenth from all your harvests.
\v 23 Bring all of those tithes to the place that the LORD your God chooses for you for His worship. Enjoy there all kinds of dishes made from your tithes— from wheat, olive oil, and new wine. There you will also eat meat from each of your livestock that are born first by their mothers. By doing all of these things you will learn to always have a sense of fear and respect for the LORD.
\p
\v 24 “If the place that the LORD has chosen to worship Him is too far from your house, and if you aren't able to bring the tithes of your produce because the LORD your God blesses all of your efforts so much, then do this thing:
\v 25 Sell the tithe from the fruits of your labor, and bring that money to the place of worship that the LORD has chosen.
\v 26 There with the money, you may buy anything you want to be offered and enjoyed together in the Tent of the LORD— including cows, sheep, wine, and other alcoholic drinks. There, before the LORD, with family, you will eat and drink joyfully.
\v 27 But don’t forget to invite people from the tribe of Levi who live in your cities, because they won’t receive land portions like you.
\p
\v 28 “At the end of every three years, bring the tithe from your harvest and store that year’s tithe in the warehouse of your city.
\v 29 That food is the food for the descendants of the tribe of Levi, because they don’t receive land inheritance like you. That food stock, is also provided to help sojourners, orphans, and widows who live in your city. They may come to the warehouse where those foods are stored and take according to their needs. Do this so that the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.”
