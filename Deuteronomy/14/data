\s Clean and unclean animal\f +14:1 \fq names of animals \ft In this chapter, the names in Hebrew for several kinds of animals cannot be confirmed, and a few kinds are also difficult to differenciate in the Indonesian language.\f*
\p
\v 1 “We are the chosen people of the LORD our God. So, when mourning for people who died, we should not be the same like other nations who injure themselves or shave their hair on the front part of their heads.
\v 2 Because from among all nations on earth the LORD your God has chosen us to be His chosen people and people who are purified by Him and for Him. So we should not live like nations that don’t know the LORD.
\p
\v 3 “Don’t eat anything that the LORD declare to be unclean.
\v 4 These are the kinds of animals whose meat you may eat:
\li2 cow, sheep, goat
\li2
\v 5 deer, mutjac, mountain goat, mountain sheep, deer, and wild goat.
\p
\v 6 “Every animal those foot nails are split to two and chews the cud may be eaten.
\v 7 However, you may not eat animals like camels, rabbits, and marmot, because eventhough they chew the cud their foot nails are not split.
\v 8 And pig is unclean to be eaten, because eventhough the nails are split to two, pig does not chew the cud. Don’t eat the meat nor touch its carcass.
\p
\v 9 “You may eat any kind of fish that have scales and fins,
\v 10 but don’t you eat other animals that live in the water that does not have scales and fins. If you eat them then you will be unclean before the LORD.
\p
\v 11 “You may eat the meat of birds that are clean for the LORD.
\v 12-18 But these are the kinds of birds whose meat you may not eat:
\li2 eagle, vultures, osprey,
\li2 dd….
\li2 dd...
\li2 dd...
\p
\v 19 “Don’t eat the kinds of insects with wings and that can walk on the ground.
\v 20 But winged insects that move by jumping are clean and may be eaten.\f + \fr 14:20 \fq meaning of verse 20 \ft Literally, “(the ones) with wings are clean and you may eat them.” TSI supplemented the intended meaning of this verse with information from Lev 11:20-23. There are also some translations that understand this verse is intended for birds not insects.\f*
\p
\v 21 “Don’t you eat the carcass of an animal that dies by itself, because the blood of that animal is not extracted out. You may give or sell the carcass to foreigners that live among you, and let them eat it. But don’t you eat it, because you are the people of the LORD that is sanctified by Him and for Him.
\p Don’t you cook the meat of a child sheep or goat in its mother’s milk.”
\s Giving tithes
\p
\v 22 “Once a year you must separate a tenth from all your harvests.
\v 23 Bring all those tithes to the place that the LORD your God chose for you for His worship. Enjoy there all kinds of dishes made from your tithes— from wheat, olive oil, and new wine. There you will also eat the meat from each of your livestocks that are born first by the mother. By doing all these you will learn to continually have a sense of fear and respect to the LORD.
\p
\v 24 “If the place that the LORD has chosen to worship Him is too far from your house, and if you don’t bring the tithes of your fruits (results) because the LORD your God blesses all your business/efforts so much, then do this:
\v 25 Sell the tithe from the fruits of your labor, and bring that money to the place of worship that the LORD has chosen.
\v 26 There with the money, you may buy anything you want to be offered and enjoyed together in the camp of the LORD— including cow, sheep, wine, and other alcoholic drinks. There, before the LORD, with family, you will eat and drink joyfully.
\v 27 But don’t forget to invite people from the tribe of Levi who live in your cities, because they don’t receive land portions like you.
\p
\v 28 “At the end of every three years, bring the tithe from your harvest and store that year’s tithe in the warehouse of your city.
\v 29 Those foods are food the descendants of the tribe of Levi, because they don’t receive land inheritance like you. That food sock, is also provided to help sojourners, orphans, and widows that live in your city. They may come to the warehouse where those food ingredients are stored and bring according to their needs. Do this so that the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.”
