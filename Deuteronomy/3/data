\c 3
\s1 The Israelites defeated King Og
\p
\v 1 After that we turned towards the area of Basan. Then King Og with all his soldiers came out and attacked us in Edrei.
\v 2 But the LORD said to me, ‘Don’t be afraid of him, because I already handed him and all his citizens over to you, including his country. You will attack him as how you attacked Sihon, the king of Amorits that ruled in Hesbon before.’
\v 3 “Thus the LORD our God handed over the king of Basan named Og and all his soldiers, and we attacked them until they all died.
\v 4 At that time we captured all cities that are ruled by King Og, that is all of Argob territory. In total there are 60 cities, and there is not even one city that we did not capture from them.
\v 5 All these cities are fortified with high walls and with gates that are closed using bars. Aside from that, there are also many small cities that are not walled.
\v 6 We destroyed all those cities and killed all the inhabitants, as we did towards King Sihon.
\v 7 But we took all the livestocks and plunder from those cities.
\v 8 “So we already captured from those two kings of the Amorites the area on the east side of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River up to the Mount of Hermon.
\v 9 {The Mount of Hermon is called Siryon by the people of Sidon, and Senir by the people of Amori)
\v 10 We already captured all the cities ruled by King Og, that is all the cities in the highlands, Gilead and Basan areas, until the cities Salkha and Edrei on the east side.
\v 11 (King Og is the last giant of the Refaim tribe. His bed is made of steel with a length of 4 meter and a width of 2 meter. Until today the bed is still in the City of Raba in the territory of the Amonites.)
\s The allocation of land in the east side of Jordan River
\p
\v 12 When we captured this country, I gave the Reuben tribe and Gad tribe the territory from the city of Aroer, that is on the valley of the Arnon River, and half of the Gilead hills along with their cities.
\v 13 The whole of the Argob territory— that is the remaining of the Gilead area and the whole of Basan area where the kingdom of Og used to be— I hand over to half of the Manasseh tribe. (The land of Basan is known as the land of the Refaimites.)
\v 14 The whole of Argob territory— from Basan until the border with Gesur and Maakah territory— was taken by Yair from the Manasseh tribe. Then he named the territory Yair, like his own name, so that up to today the whole of Argob territory is known as Yair territory.
\v 15 Next, I handed the north area of the Gilead territory to the Makhir clan, from the Manasseh tribe.
\v 16 I also gave part of the Gilead territory to the tribe of Reuben and Gad. The area of that territory is from middle part of Arnon River in the south side, and up to north until the Yabok River, which borders with the Amonites.
\v 17 This territory is bordered by the Jordan River in the west side, Galilea Lake in the north, Dead Sea in the south, and foot of Mount of Pisgah in the east.
\v 18 “At that time I said to you, tribes of Reuben and Gad, ‘The LORD our God is giving this country to you for you to own, but you must also fight for your brothers. So now your soldiers must cross the Jordan River armed ahead of the other Israelite tribes.
\v 19 Only your wives, children, and livestock— and I know you have many livestock— may live in the cities that I handed over to you
\v 20 until the LORD gave you freedom from war to your brothers, as He already gave to you. When they also occupy the land that the LORD our God will give to them across the Jordan River, only then can you return to each of your lands that I already gave to you.
\v 21 “At that time I will give this command to Joshua, ‘You already see with your own eyes, what has been done by the LORD, our God, towards kings Sihon and Og. The LORD will do the same towards all kingdoms where you are going.’
\v 22 So, I say to all of you, do not be afraid of them, because it is the LORD your God who will fight for each of you.”
\p Moses is forbidden to enter Canaan
\p
\v 23 “ At that time I plead for the LORD’s mercy,
\v 24 ‘O LORD our Lord, I know that Your great and powerful doings which You showed to Your servant is only the beginning! Surely there are no other gods in heaven or on earth that can do those great things like You have done.
\v 25 So please give me permission to cross the Jordan River so that I can see the beautiful country on the east side of Jordan River, and that beautiful hill area, and mountains in Lebanon over there.’
\v 26 But because of the doings of your ancestors the LORD is angry with me and said, ‘Enough! Don’t talk to Me again about this!
\v 27 You cannot cross the Jordan River! But come up to the peak of Mount of Pisgah and gaze to the west, north, south, and east to see the country from far with your own eyes.
\v 28 Before that, raise Joshua up as your successor, and strengthen him so he can be courageous and firm to lead this nation. Because he is the one who will lead them to cross the Jordan River, so that they can rule over the land that you will see from the peak of that mountain.’
\v 29 So we lived in the Jordan River Valley across the City of Bet-Peor, at the foot of Mount of Pisgah.
