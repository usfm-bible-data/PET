\s1 Israel defeats King Og
\p
\v 1 Next Moses said to the people of Israel, “When we turned towards the area of Bashan, King Og led his entire army to attack us at the city of Edrei.
\v 2 But the LORD said to me, 'Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him and all his troops and his land to you. You will attack him like you attacked Sihon, the king of the Amorites who previously ruled in Heshbon.'
\p
\v 3 “Thus the LORD our God delivered up King Og and all his troops, and we destroyed them all. There was no one we let live.
\v 4 At that time, we captured all the cities ruled by King Og, namely the entire territory of Argob. There were sixty cities in all, and there were none that we did not take from them.
\v 5 All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates that were locked with bars. In addition, there were also many small towns without walls.
\v 6 We annihilated all the inhabitants of all the cities of the kingdom of Bashan, as we did with King Sihon. All were killed, both men, women and children.
\v 7 But we took all the livestock and plunder from the cities.
\p
\v 8 “So we captured all the land east of the Jordan River from the two kings of the Amorites, starting from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon.
\v 9 (Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and Senir by the Amorites.)
\v 10 We captured all the cities controlled by King Og, that is, all the cities in the highlands, the region of Gilead and Bashan, to the cities of Salecah and Edrei to the east.
\v 11 (King Og was the last giant of the Rephaim tribe. His bed\f + \fr 1:11 \fk bed \ft The Hebrew word translated 'bed' can also mean 'coffin'. The size of the bed (or his coffin) is proof that God gave the Israelites victory over the giant they feared so much.\f* was made of iron with a length of four meters and a width of two meters. To the day of the writing of this book, that bed is still in Rabbah, in Ammonite territory.)
\s Division of land east of the Jordan River
\p
\v 12 “After we captured this land, I distributed it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad, starting from the city of Aroer in the Arnon River valley, and half of the hills of Gilead and its cities.
\v 13 I gave all the territory of Argob, the remnant of Gilead, and all the territory of Bashan, the former kingdom of Og, to half of the tribe of Manasseh. (The land of Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim.)
\v 14 The whole territory of Argob, from Bashan to the border with Geshur and Maaca, was taken by Jair from the tribe of Manasseh. Then he named the region Jair, after his own name, so that until the day of the writing of this book the entire region of Argob was known as the region of Jair.
\p
\v 15 “Next, I handed over the northern part of the territory of Gilead to the Makir family, from the tribe of Manasseh.
\v 16 I also gave parts of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The region extends from the center of the Arnon River to the south and to the north as far as the Jabbok River, which borders the territory of the Ammonites.
\v 17 This region is bordered by the Jordan River to the west, the Sea of Galilee to the north, the Dead Sea to the south, and the foot of Mount Pisgah to the east.
\p
\v 18 "At that time I said to you all, tribes of Reuben and Gad, 'Our LORD God has given you this territory, but you also have to fight for your relatives. So your army must cross the Jordan River ahead of the other tribes of Israel.
\v 19 Only your wives, your children, and your many livestock may live in the cities which I have handed over to you.
\v 20 Your troops will fight until the LORD gives your relatives relief from war, just as he has given you. After they have occupied the land across from the Jordan River that the LORD will soon give to them, then you can return to your respective lands that I have distributed.'
\p
\v 21 "At that time, I also gave this command to Joshua, 'You have seen for yourself what the LORD our God did to King Sihon and Og. The LORD will do the same with all the kingdoms west of the Jordan River. You will lead the Israelites to enter there.'
\v 22 So I say to each of you: Do not be afraid of them, for the LORD will fight for you."
\s Moses forbidden from entering Canaan
\p
\v 23 Moses continued the story, "At that time I earnestly asked the LORD repeatedly,
\v 24 'O LORD my God, I know that Your great and mighty deeds which You showed to Your servants are only the beginning! Surely there is no other ruler in heaven or on earth who can perform such great deeds You do!
\v 25 Please allow me to cross the Jordan River so that I can see the beautiful land beside the Jordan River, and that beautiful hilly area, and the mountains of Lebanon.'
\v 26 But because you once grumbled and rebelled,\x + \xo 3:26 \xt Num. 20:1-21\x* The LORD was angry with me and said, 'Enough! Don't ask Me anymore about this!
\v 27 You must not cross the Jordan River! But you may see the land from afar. Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah and look west, north, south, and east to see it.
\v 28 Raise up Joshua as your successor. Strengthen him to be courageous and strong to lead this nation, for he will lead them across the Jordan River, so that they may rule over the land which you will see from the top of the mountain.'
\v 29 This incident occurred while we were living in the Jordan River Valley, opposite the city of Beth Peor.
