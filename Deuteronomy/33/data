\s1 Moses prays a blessing for the tribes of Israel\f + \fr 33:1 \fk each tribe \ft The blessings of Moses given to the tribes of Jacob's descendants follow the birth order of Jacob's sons, but Simeon is overlooked (reason, see Gen. 49:3) like Jacob's last message to his sons in Gen. 49, Moses' final utterance of blessing was prophetic.\f*
\p
\v 1 Before he died, Moses, God's messenger, prayed this blessing for the nation of Israel:
\b
\q1
\v 2 "The LORD came to us from Mount Sinai,
\q2 He showed Himself to us like the sun rises from the region of Edom,
\q2 and illuminates us from Mount Paran.
\q1 He came with tens of thousands of angels,
\q2 and there was fire burning in His right hand.
\q1
\v 3 Behold, the LORD loves his people
\q2 and protects everyone who belongs to Him.
\q1 They bow down at His feet
\q2 and want to obey His teachings.
\q1
\v 4 I have conveyed the lesson of the LORD's law to you,
\q2 and that law is the most valuable treasure of the descendants of Jacob.
\q1
\v 5 The LORD is recognized as the King of His beloved people
\q2 when the leaders of each tribe of Israel gather together with all the people."
\b
\p
\v 6 Moses said about the tribe of Reuben,
\q1 "Tribe of Reuben, so be it that you survive and not become extinct,
\q2 but there won't be many of you.”
\b
\p
\v 7 Moses said about the tribe of Judah,
\q1 "O LORD, listen to the cry of the tribe of Judah when they ask for help,
\q2 and someday reunite them with their fellow tribes.
\q2 Help them and strengthen their hands against their enemies."
\b
\p
\v 8 Moses said about the tribe of Levi,
\q1 "O LORD, the tribe of Levi was pleasing in your eyes,
\q2 then to them You entrusted the office of priest and authority to use the Urim and Thummim to find out Your will.\x + \xo 33:8 Ex. 17.7; \xt Ex. 28:30; Lev. 8:8; 1 Sam. 14:41-42\x*
\q2 You tested them at Massah and argued with them at the spring of Meribah.\f + \fr 33:8 \fk Massah and Meriba \ft These two names are reminiscent of two occasions when the people of Israel were tested because of a lack of water and quarreled with Moses and Aaron (who are descendants of Levi). The name Massah means "test" or "trial" and Meriba means "dispute". See Ex. 17:1-7; Num. 20:2-13; Deut. 32:51.\f*
\q2
\v 9 Remember, O LORD, the actions of the tribe of Levi that prove that they are faithful in keeping your commandments and keeping your covenant.
\q2 For them, being loyal to You is more important than their parents, siblings, and even their children and grandchildren.\x + \xo 33:8-9 \xt Ex. 32:26-28; Num. 25:11-13\x*
\q2
\v 10 They will teach all Your laws and statutes to the nation of Israel,
\q2 burn incense before You,
\q2 and offer burnt offerings on your altar.
\q2
\v 11 O LORD, bless their service
\q2 and be pleased with all they do.
\q2 Destroy all of their enemies until they can't get back up.”
\b
\p
\v 12 Moses said about the tribe of Benjamin,
\q1 “They are a tribe that is loved by the LORD,
\q2 and they live securely by His side.
\q1 He always dwells among them and protects them."
\b
\p
\v 13 Moses said about the two tribes of Joseph,
\q2 "May the LORD bless the territory of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh with rain from the sky
\q2 and springs from underground.
\q2
\v 14 Let the LORD give them warm sunshine,
\q2 so that the plants can grow well and their crops be abundant every month.
\q2
\v 15 May their hill country, which has been fertile since ancient times,
\q2 produce a lot of sweet fruit for them.
\q2
\v 16 And may they be blessed with other riches that are in their land.
\q2 May the LORD, who appeared to me in a burning bush, be pleased with them.
\q2 Let this blessing of the LORD be like a crown that adorns the two tribes of Joseph so that they are always influential among the other tribes of Israel.
\q2
\v 17 Like a bull that strikes an enemy with its horns, the tribes of Joseph are very strong.
\q2 They will invade other nations to a far away land.
\q2 Thus will be done by the descendants of Joseph's two sons,
\q2 that is tens of thousands of people from the tribe of Ephraim and thousands of people from the tribe of Manasseh."
\b
\q1
\v 18 Moses said about the tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Issachar,
\q1 "May the people of Zebulun be successful in their trade abroad,
\q2 and may the people of Issachar prosper in their region.
\q2
\v 19 Zebulun and Issachar will enjoy prosperity from trading with ships anchored offshore.
\q2 They will invite the other tribes of Israel to participate in the joy of the feast of sacrifice
\q2 before the LORD on the hill where he is worshiped."
\b
\p
\v 20 Moses said about the tribe of Gad,
\q1 "Praise the LORD, who will expand Gad's territory. The people of the tribe of Gad sit idle, like a lioness
\q2 waiting for its prey to approach, ready to pounce on its arm or head.
\q2
\v 21 I prophesy that when the leaders divide the land among the tribes of Israel, the tribe of Gad will be given the best territory.
\q2 The tribe of Gad will carry out a special task that the LORD has given them.\x + \xo 33:21 Num. 32:1-33; Jos. 4:12-13; 22:1-9\x*
\q2 Therefore they are honored as leaders among the tribes of Israel, so that they may obtain the best of territory."
\b
\p
\v 22 Moses said about the tribe of Dan,
\q1 "The people of the tribe of Dan are like a young lion,
\q2 who is ready to jump out of his cave in Bashan to pounce on his enemy."
\b
\p
\v 23 Moses said about the tribe of Naphtali,
\q1 "O tribe of Naphtali, the LORD is pleased and pours out his blessings on you.
\q2 Possess the region west of the Jordan river until the the southern end of the Lake of Galilee.\f + \fr 33:23 \fk Possess the region... \ft The Hebrew text literally says, "Own the west and south (region)." The TSI clarifies according to the region that was later given to the tribe of Naphtali.\f*
\b
\p
\v 24 Moses said concerning the tribe of Asher,
\q1 "The LORD will bless the descendants of Asher more than any other tribe,
\q2 and the other tribes of Israel will like them.
\q2 Their territory will be so rich with olives that not only their heads will be anointed with the oil, but their feet as well.
\q2
\v 25 Your cities, O tribe of Asher, will be fortified with high walls and gates of iron and bronze rods.
\q2 Thus, all your life, you will stand firm."
\b
\p
\v 26 Then Moses blessed all the people of Israel,
\q1 "O Israel, there is no one worthy of worship except the LORD your God.
\q2 He gloriously crosses the sky to help you.
\q2
\v 27 God our Rock of Protection lives forever and is able to protect and sustain us.
\q2 Before your troops advance to attack enemy territory, the LORD Himself will drive many of them away.
\q2 He himself has ordered, "Destroy them!"
\q2
\v 28 Thus the descendants of Jacob will live in safety and not be disturbed by other nations.
\q2 Your land will be abundant with wheat and wine,
\q2 and your fields will be sufficiently watered with rain.
\q2
\v 29 How happy you are, O Israel!
\q2 The other nations are not saved by the LORD like we are!
\q2 Like a shield, He protects you.
\q2 Like a mighty sword, He finishes off your enemies.
\q2 They will come to you begging to be left alive.
\q2 You will completely conquer them.”
