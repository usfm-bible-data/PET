\s1 Moses blesses the tribes of Israel
\p
\p
\v 1 Moses, God's messenger, blessed the nation of Israel before he died
\v 2 by saying,
\\b
\q1 "The LORD came to us from Mount Sinai,
\q2 He revealed Himself to us like the sun which rises from the region of Edom,
\q2 and shines on us from Mount Paran.
\q1 He came with ten thousand angels,
\q2 and there was a burning fire at His right side.
\q1
\v 3 The LORD truly loves His people,
\q2 and protects all the people He possesses.
\q1 They bow at His feet,
\q2 and obey His teachings.
\q1
\v 4 I have delivered the laws to you.
\q2 These laws are the possession of the descendants of Jacob that are most valuable.
\q1
\v 5 When all of the tribes and your leaders gather,
\q2 the LORD becomes king over the nation of Israel.
\b
\p
\v 6 Moses said regarding the tribe of Reuben,
\q1 "Oh tribe of Reuben, you will hang in there and not die,
\q2 however your number won't be many."
\b
\p
\v 7 Regarding the tribe of Judah, Moses said,
\q1 "Yes LORD, hear the cry of the tribe of Judah when they ask for help,
\q2 and unite them with their fellow tribes.
\q1 Give them strength
\q2 and help them to oppose their enemies."
\p
\v 8 The blessing that was delivered by Moses to the tribe of Levi is,
\q1 “LORD, give to the tribe of Levi, the people who obey and are faithful to You,
\q2 the Urim and Thummim so they use them to know Your will.
\q2 You have tested them by lack of water at Massah and argued with them at the springs of Meribah.
\q1
\v 9 They hold to Your promise and obey Your commands. The tribe of Levi proved that they are truly faithful to You, more than their own parents, brothers, children and grandchildren.
\q1
\v 10 They will teach all of My regulations and laws to the nation of Israel,
\q2 and they will offer incense before Me and burnt sacrifices on My altar.
\q1 
\v 11 Yes LORD, bless their service,
\q2 and be pleased with all that they do.
\q1 Destroy all of their enemies,
\q2 so that their enemies can't rise again."
\b
\p
\v 12 Regarding the tribe of Benjamin, Moses said, 
\q1 "They are a tribe that is loved by the LORD,
\q2 and they live in peace beside Him. 
\q1 He always protects them,
\q2 and lives among them."
\b
\p
\v 13 Moses blessed the tribes of Joseph by saying,
\q1 "May the LORD bless their land
\q2 by making dew fall from the sky
\q2 and water from beneath the ground.
\q1
\v 14 May He give them the best fruits that grow under the sun
\q2 and abundant harvest produce month by month.
\q1
\v 15 May their mountains, that have been from past ages,
\q2 produce much fruit that is very good,
\q1
\v 16 and their ground be filled with abundant harvest produce that is the best in all the earth.
\q2 The LORD, who revealed Himself to me in the burning bush bless them.
\q1 I hope the LORD always blesses the tribe of Joseph in every way,
\q2 he was the leader among his brothers at the time they were in Egypt. 
\q1
\v 17 Like a first born bull that gores its enemy with its horns,
\q2 the tribes of Joseph are very strong and will gore/butt other nations to the ends of the earth.
\q1 It will be done like that by the descendants of the two sons of Joseph,
\q2 that is the ten thousands of people from the tribe of Ephraim and thousands of people from the tribe of Manasseh.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Moses blessed the tribe of Zebulon and the tribe of Issachar like this,
\q1 "May the people of Zebulon succeed in their journey,
\q2 and may the people of Issachar be prosperous in their camps.
\q1
\v 19 They call the other tribes of Israel to the mountain,
\q2 and there they offer sacrifices that are right to Me. 
\q2 They enjoy the riches from the sea and from the sand on the shore."
\b
\p
\v 20 Moses blessed the tribe of Gad like this,
\q1 "Praise to the LORD, who has enlarged the district of Gad.
\q2 People of the tribe of Gad live there like a lion lives, ready to pounce on the arm or even the head of its prey.
\q1
\v 21 They chose the area that is the best in the land for themselves,
\q2 they received a bigger portion, worthy of a leader.
\q1 When the leaders of Israel gather,
\q2 the tribe of Gad performs what is just for God and obey His rules."
\b
\p
\v 22 Moses blessed the tribe of Dan like this,
\q2 "The people of the tribe of Dan are like a young lion— that is ready to jump out from a cave in Bashan to attack the enemy."
\b
\p 
\v 23 And he blessed the tribe of Naphtali like this,
\q1 "Oh Naphtali, the LORD is pleased with you and you all abound with His blessings,
\q2 rule the district from Lake Galilea to the south."
\b
\p
\v 24 He blessed the tribe of Asher like this,
\q1 "The LORD bless the descendants of Asher more than other tribes.
\q2 May the LORD be most pleased with them among the other tribes of Israel.
\q2 May their land produce many olives that are good to make oil.
\q1
\v 25 Their cities will be protected by high walls with gates that are made from iron and bronze,
\q2 and may they always live peacefully protected."
\b
\p
\v 26 Then Moses said to the people of Israel,
\q1 "Oh Israel! there is no god like your God,
\q2 who rides the clouds and crosses the sky magnificently to help you.
\q2
\v 27 He is the God who lives forever,
\q2 who protects you, as if He embraces your shoulders with His everlasting arms to protect you.
\q1 He will drive out your enemies when you advance to fight,
\q2 He has ordered you to destroy all of them.
\q1
\v 28 In that way the nation of Israel will live peacefully,
\q2 the descendants of Jacob won't be bothered by other nations,
\q1 your land will abound with wheat and wine,
\q2 and the sky will drop dew there.
\q1
\v 29 How blessed you all are, oh Israel!
\q2 There is no other nation like you.
\q1 You all are saved by the LORD and He protects you like a shield,
\q2 and He gives you all victory against enemies like a sword.
\q1 Your enemies will come to you asking for mercy,
\q2 however you will step on them."
