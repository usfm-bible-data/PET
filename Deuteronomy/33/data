\s1 Moses prays blessings for the tribes of Israel\f + \fr 33:1 \fk each tribe \ft The blessings of Moses given to the tribes of Jacob's descendants follow the birth order of Jacob's sons, but Simeon is overlooked (reason, see Gen.49: 3) as Jacob's last message to his sons in Gen. 49, Moses' final utterance of blessing was prophetic.\f*
\p
\v 1 Before dying, Moses, God's messenger, prayed this blessing for the nation of Israel:
\b
\q1
\v 2 "The LORD came to us from Mount Sinai,
\q2 He shows Himself to us as the sun rises from the region of Edom,
\q2 and illuminates us from Mount Paran.
\q1 He came with tens of thousands of angels,
\q2 and there was a fire burning in His right hand.
\q1
\v 3 Behold, the LORD loves his people
\q2 and protect everyone who belongs to Him.
\q1 They bowed down at His feet
\q2 and want to obey His teachings.
\q1
\v 4 I have delivered the lesson of the LORD's law to you,
\q2 and the law is the most valuable treasure of the line of Jacob.
\q1
\v 5 The LORD is recognized as the King of His beloved people
\q2 when the leaders of each tribe of Israel gathered together with all the people."
\b
\p
\v 6 Moses said about the tribe of Reuben,
\q1 "Reuben tribe, let you survive and not become extinct,
\q2 but there won't be many of you.”
\b
\p
\v 7 Moses said about the tribe of Judah,
\q1 "O LORD, listen to the cry of the tribe of Judah when they ask for help,
\q2 and someday reunite them with their fellow tribes.
\q2 Help them and strengthen their hands against their enemies."
\b
\p
\v 8 Moses said about the tribe of Levi,
\q1 "The LORD, the tribe of Levi has pleased you,
\q2 then You entrusted the office of priest and authority to use the Urim and Thummim to find out Your will.\x + \xo 33:8 Ex. 17.7; \xt Ex. 28:30; Lev. 8:8; 1 Sam. 14:41-42\x*
\q2 You tested them in Massah and argued with them in the spring of Meribah.\f + \fr 33:8 \fk Mass and Meriba \ft These two names are reminiscent of two occasions when the people of Israel were tested for lack of water and took root with Moses and Aaron (who is a descendant of Levi). The name Masa means "test" or "trial" and Meriba means "dispute". See Ex. 17:1-7; Num. 20:2-13; Deut. 32:51.\f*
\q2
\v 9 Remember, O LORD, the actions of the tribe of Levi that prove that they are faithful in keeping your commandments and keeping your covenants.
\q2 To them, being loyal to You is more important than their parents, siblings, and even their children and grandchildren.\x + \xo 33:8-9 \xt Ex. 32:26-28; Num. 25:11-13\x*
\q2
\v 10 They will teach all Your laws and statutes to the nation of Israel,
\q2 burn incense before You,
\q2 and offer burnt offerings on your altar.
\q2
\v 11 O LORD, bless their service
\q2 and please be pleased with all they do.
\q2 Destroy all of their enemies until they can't get back up.”
\b
\p
\v 12 Moses said about the tribe of Benjamin,
\q1 “They are a tribe the LORD loves,
\q2 and they live safely by His side.
\q1 He always lived among them and protected them."
\b
\p
\v 13 Moses said about the two tribes of Joseph,
\q2 "May the LORD bless the territory of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh with rain from heaven
\q2 and springs from underground.
\q2
\v 14 Let the LORD give them warm sunshine,
\q2 so that the plants can grow well and their crops are abundant every month.
\q2
\v 15 May their hill country, which has been fertile since ancient times,
\q2 produces a lot of sweet fruit for them.
\q2
\v 16 And may they be blessed with other riches that are in their land.
\q2 May the LORD, who appeared to me in a burning bush, be pleased with them.
\q2 Let this blessing of the LORD be like a crown that beautifies the two tribes of Joseph so that it will always be influential among the other tribes of Israel.
\q2
\v 17 Like a bull that strikes an enemy with its horn, the tribes of Joseph were very strong.
\q2 They will invade other nations to a far away land.
\q2 Thus will the offspring of Joseph's two sons do,
\q2 that is tens of thousands of people from the tribe of Ephraim and thousands of people from the tribe of Manasseh."
\b
\q1
\v 18 Moses said about the tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Isachar,
\q1 "May the people of Zebulun be successful in their trade abroad,
\q2 and may the people of Isachar prosper in their region.
\q2
\v 19 Zebulun and Isachar would enjoy prosperity from trading with ships anchored offshore.
\q2 They will invite the other tribes of Israel to join in the joy of the sacrifice
\q2 before the LORD on the hill where he worshiped."
\b
\p
\v 20 Moses said about the tribe of Gad,
\q1 "Praise the LORD, who will expand Gad's territory. The people of the tribe of Gad sat idle, like lionesses
\q2 which is waiting for its prey to approach, ready to pounce on its arm or head.
\q2
\v 21 I prophesied that when the leaders divided the land among the tribes of Israel, the tribe of Gad would be given the best territory.
\q2 The tribe of Gad will carry out a special task that the LORD has given them.\x + \xo 33:21 Num. 32: 1-33; Jos. 4:12-13; 22:1-9\x*
\q2 Therefore they are honored as leaders among the tribes of Israel, so that they may have the best of territory."
\b
\p
\v 22 Moses said about the tribe of Dan,
\q1 "The tribes of Dan are like a young lion,
\q2 who is ready to jump out of his cave in Basan to pounce on his enemy."
\b
\p
\v 23 Moses said about the tribe of Naphtali,
\q1 "O tribe of Naphtali, the LORD is pleased and pours his blessings on you.
\q2 Take control of the region west of the Jordan to the Sea of Galilee at the southern end.\fk + \fr 33:23 \fk Rule the region ... \ft The Hebrew text literally says, "Own west and south." The TSI clarified the area that was later given to the Naphtali tribe.\f*
\b
\p
\v 24 Moses said concerning the tribe of Asher,
\q1 "The LORD will bless the descendants of Asher more than any other tribe,
\q2 and the other tribes of Israel will like them.
\q2 Their territory will be so rich with olives that not only their heads will be anointed with the oil, but their feet as well.
\q2
\v 25 Your cities, O tribe of Asher, will be fortified with high walls and gates of iron and bronze rods.
\q2 Thus, all your life, you will stand firm."
\b
\p
\v 26 Then Moses blessed all the people of Israel,
\q1 "O Israel, there is no one worthy of worship except the LORD your God.
\q2 He gloriously crossed the sky to help you.
\q2
\v 27 Forever God our Guardian Rock lives and is able to protect and sustain us.
\q2 Before your troops can advance to attack enemy territory, the LORD Himself will drive many of them away.
\q2 He himself had ordered, "Destroy them!"
\q2
\v 28 Thus the descendants of Jacob will live in safety and not be disturbed by other nations.
\q2 Your land will be abundant with wheat and wine,
\q2 and your fields will be sufficiently watered with rain.
\q2
\v 29 How happy you are, O Israel!
\q2 The other nations are not saved by the LORD like we are!
\q2 Like a shield, He protects you.
\q2 Like a mighty sword, He finishes off your enemies.
\q2 They will come to you begging to be left alive.
\q2 You will completely conquer them.”
