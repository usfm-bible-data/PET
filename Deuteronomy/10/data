\c 10
\s1 A copy of God’s Ten Commandments
\p
\v 1 “At that time, the LORD said to me, ‘Carve two tablets of stone like the first one, and make a wooden ark to keep it. Then bring those two tablets of stone up this mountain.
\v 2 I will write on those two tablets of stone the same words with what I wrote on the first two tablets of stone, which you broke. Then put the two tablets of stone into the ark.’
\p
\v 3 “Then I made an ark from acacia wood and carved two tablets of stone like the first two tablets of stone, then went up the mountain bringing the two tablets of stone.
\v 4 Then the LORD wrote His Ten Commandments on the two tablets of stone and gave them to me. The writings are the same with what He wrote on the first two tablets of stone— that is what the LORD said to us from the midst of fire in the mountain, on the day when you gathered on the foot of the mountain.\p
\v 5 Then I went down the mountain bringing the two tablets of stone and put them into the ark that I made, according to the LORD’s commands to me. Those two tablets of stone are still in the ark until now.”
\p
\v 6 (Then, the Israelites moved from the wells owned by the descendants of Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried. His child— Eleazar, replaced his father as the high priest.
\v 7 From Moserah, they went to Gudgodah, then to Jotbathah, where there are many small rivers.
\v 8 During that time, the LORD specially appointed the tribe of Levi to bring the ark of covenant containing the two tablets of stones that are written with the LORD’s Ten Commandments. He also appointed them as priests to serve Him and to pray that the LORD will bless the Israelites. The tribe of Levi is doing those tasks until now.
\v 9 Because of that, the tribe of Levi does not receive distribution of inheritance land like the other tribes of Israel. Their inheritance is the special right to become priests for the LORD, like what the LORD your God said to them.)
\p
\v 10 Moses continued, “I lived in the mountain for forty days and forty nights, like what I did before. Once again, the LORD listened to my plea so that He did not destroy you.
\v 11 Then the LORD said to me, ‘Let’s go, continue your journey! Lead them to enter and conquer the land that I promised to your ancestors.’”
\s1 The LORD’s request
\p
\v 12 “O, Israelites, the LORD God demands that we respect Him, our way of life must be according to all His commands. We have to love Him and worship Him with our whole heart and soul.
\v 13 And for each of our own good, let us obey every command of the LORD that I am teaching you today.
\p
\v 14 “Don’t forget that the LORD your God is the owner of the sky, even the highest sky. The earth and all that is in it is His.
\v 15 Eventhough He owns all those, the LORD loves your ancestors even more. He chose us, their descendants, from among all nation, so that now we became His people.
\v 16 So, from now every person among us must be obedient to the LORD and don’t be hard-headed anymore. \f + \fr 10:16 \ft \+dc hard-headed\+dc*\ft* Literally the Hebrew writes, ‘circumcize your heart’.\f*
\p
\v 17 The LORD our God is bigger than all the fake gods and all rulers. He is very strong and awe-inspiring and great. He does not do things for the sake of benefiting one group and does not take bribes.
\v 18 He defends the cause of the orphans and widows. He loves sojourners that live among us, and give them food and clothing.
\v 19 You must also love sojourners because you once lived as sojourners in Egypt.
\v 20 Fear and respect the LORD God and worship Him. Stay united to the LORD and bind all your covenants only in name.
\v 21 He is your God, the only one that deserves to be praised, who has shown His great and miraculous deeds to us.
\p
\v 22 When our ancestors evacuated to Egypt, they were only seventy people. But now the LORD our God has made us as many as stars in the sky!”
