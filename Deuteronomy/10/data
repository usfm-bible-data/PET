\s1 A copy of the Ten Commandments
\p
\v 1 Moses continued his story to the people of Israel, “At that time, the LORD said to me, 'Chisel two stone tablets like the first, and make a wooden chest for their place. Then carry the two stone tablets up this mountain to meet Me.
\v 2 I will write on the two stone tablets the same words I wrote on the first two stones, which you have broken. Then put the two new plates in the chest.'
\p
\v 3 “So I made a chest of acacia wood and chiseled two stone slabs into like the first two stone slabs, then went up the mountain carrying the two stone plates.
\v 4 Then the LORD wrote His Ten Commandments on the two stones and gave them to me. It is the same writing that He wrote on the first two stone tablets, which is the commandment that the LORD told us from the middle of the fire on the mountain, when you were gathered at the foot of the mountain.
\v 5 Then I went down with the two stone plates and put them in the chest which I had made, according to the LORD's command to me. The two stone tablets are still in the chest today."
\p
\v 6 (Then the Israelites moved from the wells belonging to the descendants of Yaakan to Mosera. There Aaron died and was buried. His son, Eleazar, succeeded his father as high priest.\x + \xo 10:6 \xt Num. 20:22-29; 33:16, 37-38\x*
\v 7 From Moserah they went to Gudgod, then to Yotbathah, where there were many tributaries.
\v 8 At that time, the LORD specifically assigned the tribe of Levi as His servants to carry out various tasks, including carrying the LORD's covenant chest and saying blessings on behalf of the LORD for the people of Israel.\x + \xo 10:8 \xt Num. 6:23-26 \x* They still have such duties to this day.
\v 9 Therefore, the tribe of Levi did not accept the division of land to become their inheritance, like the other tribes of Israel. What the tribe of Levi received to pass on to their descendants was the privilege of being a special servant to the LORD God, according to His promise to them.)
\p
\v 10 Next Moses said, “I stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights, just as I did before. Once again, the LORD listened to my pleas so that He would not destroy you.
\v 11 Then the LORD said to me, 'It is time to go on your way! Lead My people into and control the land that I promised their ancestors.’"
\s1 Basic life according to the LORD's will
\p
\v 12 "O people of Israel, the LORD God demands that each one of us honor Him. Your way of life must be in accordance with all His commands. You must love Him and worship Him alone sincerely and with all your heart.\x + \xo 10:12 \xt Deut. 4:29\x*
\v 13 For your own good, obey every commandment of the LORD that I teach you today.
\p
\v 14 "Do not forget that the LORD your God is the Owner of all levels of heaven and heaven, as well as the earth and all that is in it.\x + \xo 10:14 \xt Gen. 1:1\x*
\v 15 Even though He owns all of these, God made our ancestors special, so that we — their descendants — become His beloved people among all nations!
\v 16 So from now on, with all your heart decide to always obey the LORD, and don't be stubborn anymore.\f + \fr 10:16 \fk all your heart ... stubborn \ft Literally Hebrew writes two metaphors, 'circumcise your heart' and 'don't stiffen your neck'.\f*
\p
\v 17 “The LORD our God is greater than all gods and all powers. He is very strong, awesome, and terrible. He does not take sides in His decisions and does not accept bribes.
\v 18 He defended the rights of orphans and widows. He loved the immigrants who lived among us, and gave them food and clothing.
\v 19 You also must love foreigners, because you, too, were foreigners in Egypt.
\v 20 Fear and honor the LORD your God, and worship Him alone. Keep holding fast to the LORD, and keep all your covenants in His name alone.
\v 21 He is your God! Only He is the only one worthy of praise. He performed mighty miracles, and we have seen it ourselves.
\v 22 Remember that when our ancestors fled to Egypt, they were only seventy people. But now the LORD has made us as many as the stars in the sky!”
