\s1 Debt write-off on the Sabbath Year\x + \xo 15:1 \xt Ex. 23:10-11; Lev. 25:1-7\x*
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “At the end of the seventh year, all the people of Israel must forgive all the debts of their fellow Israelites.
\v 2 To do this, everyone who has lent money to fellow Israelites must consider those debts paid in full. You are obligated to do it because the time for relief commanded by the LORD has arrived.
\v 3 You can still collect debts from outsiders who live with you. Only to fellow Israelites must debt be written off at the end of the seventh year.
\p
\v 4-5 “The LORD your God will bless you in the land that He is giving you. If everyone obeys the commandments of the LORD that I am telling you today, there will be no more poor among you.
\v 6 The LORD will certainly bless you according to his promise, so that you will lend money to people of other nations, but will never be in debt to them. Therefore the nation of Israel will rule over other nations, but never be ruled by them.
\p
\v 7 “Later, after you are already living in the land the LORD is giving to you, and there is a poor Israelite with you in one of the cities, do not close your eyes and be stingy with him.
\v 8 Rather, you must be generous and lend to him to meet his needs.
\v 9 So be careful not to think evil things like this, 'The seventh year when we have to write off debts is near. If I lend something to my poor neighbor, he will not pay his debt later.' Don't be suspicious of your neighbor like that to the extent that you don't want to help him, because if he complains about you to the LORD, you will be considered sinful in the eyes of the LORD!
\v 10 Give him a generous loan, for in this way the LORD will bless you in all your efforts and work.
\v 11 There will always be poor people in your country. That is why I command you: You must accept your poor and needy neighbors with open arms.”
\s Regulations concerning the release of slaves from the Israelites\x + \xo 15:11 \xt Ex. 21:2-6; Lev. 25:39-43\x*
\p
\v 12 “If one of your fellow Israelites, whether male or female, rents out his labor as a slave to you, you must let him go after he has worked for six years. In the seventh year, the Sabbath Year, it is your duty to let him go.
\v 13 And when releasing him, do not let him go empty-handed.
\v 14 You are to give him an abundant provision from your earnings, such as livestock, crops, and produce from the vineyard. As the LORD your God has blessed you, so you must give to him.
\v 15 Remember that you yourself were slaves in Egypt, and the LORD redeemed you. That is why I am giving this order.
\v 16 “But if your slave loves you and your family, and feels fortunate to be with you, then he can say to you, 'I don't want to leave you.'
\v 17 If your slave makes that decision, then have him stand leaning against the door of your house as a base to pierce his earlobes with a sharp awl. This indicates that he will be your slave for the rest of his life.
\p
\v 18 “Do not feel like it is a loss to give up your slave who is a fellow Israelite. Remember that he has served you for the full six years, and his work is two times more than a day laborer over the course of the same time. By obeying this rule, the LORD will bless you in everything you do.”
\s1 Rules concerning the offering of firstborn livestock
\p
\v 19-20 ”After you have taken possession of the land of Canaan, and the LORD your God has determined the location of his tabernacle there, every firstborn male of your livestock shall be presented to the LORD. Do this once a year in that place of worship, where you and your family will enjoy the meat of the sacrifices. Do not put the firstborn bulls to work, and do not trim the hair of the firstborn rams to sell.
\v 21 But if the firstborn of an animal is disabled, for example lame, blind, or has other serious disabilities, the animal may not be offered to the LORD your God.
\v 22 You may chop and eat the meat at home, like eating venison or gazelle. Everyone can eat, whether they are unclean or not.
\v 23 Always remember that the blood should not be eaten. The blood must be drained upon the ground when you slaughter the animal.”
