\s1 Erasing/Cancelling debts on the Sabbath Year\x + \xo 15:1 \xt Lev. 25:1-6\x*
\p
\v 1 “Every end of the seventh year, the whole of the people of Israel must erase all debts between the Israelites.
\v 2 How to do this is every one of you who has borrowed money to other Israelites must erase the debt of that person. You must do that because the LORD has declared it must be so.
\v 3 You still may collect debt towards sojourners that live with you. Only towards other Israelites that debt must be erased on the seventh year.
\p
\v 4-5 “LORD your God will bless you in the land that He gives to you. If you obey the commands of the LORD your God as I conveyed to you today, then there will be no poor people among you.
\v 6 The LORD your God will surely bless you according to what He has promised, so that you will lend money to other nations. But you will never borrow money from them. You will conquer those nations, but they will never conquer you.
\p
\v 7 “Later when you live in the land that the LORD your God gave, and in one the cities there is a fellow Israelite who is poor, [don’t ignore//don’t pretend you don’t care] and be stingy towards him.
\v 8 Instead, be generous and lend to him to fulfill his needs.
\v 9 Ensure that you do not keep evel thoughts like this in your heart, ‘The Year of Sabbath when all debts are erased is close, so if I lend something to my fellow who is poor, he will not pay his debt.’ Don’t suspect your fellow like that so that you don’t help him. Lest your fellow tells of his hardships to the LORD, and the LORD will consider you to have sinned against him!
\v 10 Give a loan generously to him, because in that way the LORD your God will bless you in whatever you do and work on.
\v 11 Poor people will always be in your land. That is why I command you: You must accept your fellow poor and needy people with open hands.”
\s Rule about freeing slaves from the people of Israel
\p
\v 12 “If there are among you fellow Israelites— whether men or women— who sells himself as a slave to you, you must free him after he works for you for six years. On the seventh year, you must release him.
\v 13 And when you release him, don’t let him go without bringing anything.
\v 14 You must give him abundantly from your earnings— including from (your) livestocks, harvest, and vineyard harvest. Just like how the LORD your God has blessed you, so you also must give to him.
\v 15 Remember that you yourself also live as a slave in Egypt, and the LORD your God has redeemed you. THat is why I give this command to you.
\v 16 “But if you slave loves you and your family, and feels fortunate to live with you, then he can say to you, ‘I don’t want to leave you(, Master)’
\v 17 If your male or female slaves say something like that, then bring him to the door of your house, and while he is standing and leaning on the door of that house, make a hole on his ear lobe using a sharp piercing tool. This signifies that he will be your slave his whole life until the day of his death.
\p
\v 18 “Don’t you complain if you have to free your slaves who is a fellow Israelite. Remember that he already served you for a full six years, and the benefit of his service is far more than double the (fruits of the) work of a paid employee for the same period of time. And by obeying this rule, the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do.”
\s1 Rule about sacrificing firstborn animals
\p
\v 19-20 After you conquer the land of Canaan and the LORD your God has showed the place of His worship there, every male first child from among your livestocks must be offered to the LORD. Do this once a year in that place of worship where you and your family will enjoy the meat from those sacrifices.
\p Don’t put the male cow that is a first child to work. And don’t cut and sell the fur of a male sheep that is a first child.
\p
\v 21 “But if the first child of that animal is defective— including lame, blind, or have other serious defects, that animal cannot be offered to the LORD your God.
\v 22 You may cut and eat the meat of that animal in your house like eating the meat of deer or the meat of muntjac. Everyone may eat, whether those whose actions are clean or those who still live in an unclean (way).
\v 23 (You) only need to always remember that you cannot eat the blood. Because the blood must be flowed out to the ground when you kill that animal.”
