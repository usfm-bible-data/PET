\c 17
\s Warning of offering defective animals
\p
\v 1 "Don't offer to the Lord your oxen, sheep, or goats that are defective, because the LORD despises offerings like that.
\s Judgment for idol worshipers
\p
\v 2-4 "Suppose a person among you or in one of the cities that the LORD our God gives to you is accused of doing evil which opposes the covenant that the LORD bound with our forefathers. [For example they//The transgression that I mean is that] worship [0//and serve] gods [or//â€” including the sun, moon and stars. Then you must examine that person. If its really true that the person did that evil in Israel,
\v 5 then you must bring the person out of the that city and throw stones at him until dead.
\p
\v 6 "A person may only be given the death penalty if his transgression was proven based on the explanation of two or three witnesses. It is forbidden to give the death penalty based on the witness of just one person.
\v 7 The witnesses must become the first to throw stones at the transgressor, only then many people throw stones at them until dead. In that way you must get rid of all evil from among you."
\s Trying a difficult case
\p
\v 8 If there is a case that is too difficult to be settled by the judges in a place, then bring that case to the place of worship that the LORD our God will determine. For example deciding a difficult case to determine the level of punishment for murder, fighting for various rights of possession or power, or punishment for various violent (acts) toward a person.
\v 9 Submit it to the Levite priests and judges who are on duty at that time in the place of worship. They will decide difficult cases for you.
\v 10 Then each person among you who is involved in a difficult case must carefully carry out the decision that they give there.
\v 11 After they interpret the law of the LORD and give the decision about that case, you each have to carry it out. Don't turn aside from the final decision that they give to you.
\v 12 The person who arrogantly doesn't obey the priests or judges who serve before the LORD your God, must be sentence to die. By doing that you must wipe out evil from among you.
\v 13 Then all of the people will hear and become afraid, and won't again be daringly arrogant like that.
\s Guide for kings in Israel
\p
\v 14 "After you enter the land that the LORD our God gives to you, and after you rule and stay there, you might say. 'Come let's lift up a king to govern over us, like other nations that are around us.'
\v 15 You may lift up a king to govern over you, but it must be the person whom is appointed by the LORD our God. And it must be a person descended from Israel, not a person from another nation.
\p
\v 16 "After that person becomes king, he may not gather many horses for his troops. He may not send a group to Egypt to buy horses, because the LORD has said, 'You may not return again to that land.'
\v 17 That king also may not possess many wives, so that his wives don't influence to [turn from//distance] the LORD. And the king also may not gather much gold and silver."
\v 18 "When the king has governed his kingdom, he himself has to copy this book of the law for himself, according to the guidance of the priest descendants of the tribe of Levi.
\v 19 "That book must always be near to him, and everyday as long as he lives he must read it, so that he learns fear of the LORD our God and keep doing all of these laws and statutes.
\v 20 In that way the king won't become arrogant and consider himself to be better than his nations people. And in that way the king won't turn aside anywhere from these laws so that he and his descendants will [0//live long and] govern long over the nation of Israel."
