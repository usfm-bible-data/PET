\c 17
\s Warning about the sacrifice of defective animals
\p
\v 1 "Do not offer cows, goats, or sheep that are defective to the LORD our God, for the LORD disgusts such offerings."
\s Punishment for idol worshipers
\p
\v 2-4 "If later in one of the cities that the LORD has given to you there is someone who is accused of committing a crime that violates God's commandments and His covenant with our ancestors - for example, worshiping gods, including the sun, moon, and stars - then you have to find out whether the accusation is true. If it is true that this person committed the crime in Israel,
\v 5 You must take him out of his city and stone him to death.
\p
\v 6 "A person can only be sentenced to death if the violation is proven based on the testimony of two or three witnesses. It is prohibited to impose a death sentence on the testimony of just one person.
\v 7 The witnesses had to be the first to stone the offender, then the other people followed. In this way, you will eradicate evil from among the Israelites."
\s Try difficult cases
\p
\v 8-9 â€œIf there is a matter that is too difficult for the judges in your city to solve, then submit it to the priests and chief judges who are serving in the city where the LORD's tabernacle is located. They will decide the difficult things for you. Examples of difficult cases are distinguishing sentences for various kinds of murder cases, seizing various kinds of property or power rights, or punishments for various kinds of acts of violence.
\v 10 Then everyone involved in the case must properly carry out the decisions they receive there.
\v 11 After the priests and judges have judged according to the law of the LORD, each one of you must carry it out. Don't deviate from the final decision they give you.
\v 12-13 Anyone who proudly disobeyed the priest or judge who served before the LORD was to be put to death. Then all the people will hear and be afraid to act arrogant like that. Thus you eradicate such evil from among the people of Israel."
\s Guide for the king of Israel
\p
\v 14 "After you rule and settle in the land that the LORD God will soon hand over to you, maybe someone will say, 'Let us raise a king to rule us, like the other nations around us.'
\v 15 You may appoint a king, but this must be the person appointed by the LORD, and he must be of the descent of Israel, not of another nation.
\p
\v 16 "After a man becomes king, he must not gather many horses for his army. He could not send an entourage to Egypt to buy horses, because the LORD had commanded, 'You must not go back to that land again.'
\v 17 It is forbidden for a king to have multiple wives, so that his wife does not influence him to turn from the LORD. The king also could not collect a lot of gold and silver.
\v 18 "When a man is king, he must copy this book of the law for himself, according to the guidance of the priests of the tribe of Levi.
\v 19 The book must always be near him, and every day of his life he must read it, so that he may learn to fear and honor the LORD and keep all these laws and statutes.
\v 20 Thus, the king did not become arrogant and considered himself better than his fellow countrymen, and would not deviate from these laws in any way. That way he and his descendants may continue to lead the nation of Israel."
