\s The Israelites wandering in the wilderness
\p
\v 1 “Then according to the commandment of the LORD to me,\x + \xo 2: 1 \xt Deut. 1:40\x* we returned to the Red Sea by way of that wilderness region. And we wandered for a long time around Mount Seir.
\p
\v 2 “Then the LORD said unto me,
\v 3 ‘You have been wandering around this mountain long enough. Go north
\v 4 and command the people: You will pass through the region of your brothers, the Edomites, who are the descendants of Esau who live in region of Seir. They will be afraid of you. Because of that each of you must be vigilant!
\v 5 Don't incite them to war, because that arena is not the land that I will give you— not even the slightest! I have given the land to Esau and his descendants.
\v 6 For food and even drinking water, you most buy it from them with money.
\v 7 All this time I, the LORD your God, have blessed each of you in all your endeavors. I have been with you for forty years you wandered in that vast wilderness, and you lacked nothing.’
\p
\v 8 “So we passed through the area of our brothers of Esau descent who live in the region of Seir, and we did not follow the road which goes through the Jordan River Valley, which is the road that passes through the city of Elat and Ezion Geber.\f + \fr 2: 8 \fk information about locations \ft Literally, the Jordan River Valley is called by the old name, which is 'Araba'. The two port cities, Elat and Ezion Geber, are located at the north end of the Gulf of Akaba.\f* But we turned north toward the wilderness of Moab.
\v 9 Then the LORD said to me, ‘Do not bother the Moabites or incite them so war results, because the Moabites are descendants of Lot, and the land of Ar\f + \fr 1: 9 \fk Ar \ft is the capital of Moab. In the past the City of Ar was known as a large city in the land of Moab, but now it is unknown where that city is.\f* I have given them. So from their land I will not give you even a little.’
\pi
\v 10 (Formerly the City of Ar was inhabited by Emimites. Their number was large, and their bodies were large and tall like giants.\f + \fr 2:10 \fk giant \ft In this verse and verses 11 and 21, literally, 'Anakim', which is the name of one giant tribe.\f*
\v 11 Because they are like giants, they are considered as Rephaites.\f + \fr 2:11 \fk Refaim \ft See the note at Gen. 14: 5\f* But the Moabites call them Emimites.
\v 12 Previously Seir was also inhabited by the Horites, but the descendants of Esau came in to attack and finish them, then occupied the land. So at a later time the Israelites (will) drive away their enemies in the land which was given by the Lord to them.)
\p
\v 13 Then the LORD said, “Rise up and cross Kali Zered.” So we crossed the river.
\p
\v 14 “From when we moved to Kadesh Barnea to when we crossed Zered Stream, we had wandered for thirty eight years. And at the end, all our soldiers of the first generation had died from among us, as the Lord has sworn about them.\x + \xo 2:14 \xt 1: 34-36\x*
\v 15 It was the LORD Himself that fought against them, until they all perished and vanished from the camp.
\p
\v 16 “So after all those soldiers died,
\v 17 The Lord said to me,
\v 18 ‘Today cross the border in the city of Ar, and pass through the area of Moab until it enters the Amorite territory.\f + \fr 2:18 \fk enters ... Amorite \ft The Amorite territory entered by the Israelites this time is not written in this verse in Hebrew, but it is made explicit in the TSI so that the existence of various races is clarified. The two nations descended from Lot were Moab (verse 9) and Ammon (verse 19). While the Israelites will be allowed to control the Amorite territory.\f*
\v 19 And when you pass through the territory of the Ammonites, do not disturb or attack them, beceause the Ammonites are the descendants of Lot. I have given that land to them. I will not give even the smallest bit to you from their territory.’”
\p
\v 20 (The land of Ar was once inhabited by a tribe of giants called Refaim, but the Ammonites called them Zamzumim.
\v 21 The people of Rephaim were strong, tall and many, but the Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites, so that the Ammonites captured and occupied the land.
\v 22 This is also the same as what the LORD did for the Edomites, that is, descendants of Esau who lived in Seir. The LORD exterminated the Horites, so that the Edomites captured the land and have settled in it until now.
\v 23 The same thing happened with the Caftor people who came from the island of Crete. They exterminated the Awis who previously lived along the coast of the sea to Gaza, then controlled their territory.)
\s The Israelites crossing the Arnon River
\p
\v 24 “While we were passing through the area of Moab, the LORD said,‘ Get ready and cross the Arnon Gorge. There you will oppose with the Amorite king Sihon, who ruled from the city of Hesbon. I have handed him and his country to you. Attack him and seize his country.
\v 25 From today I will make all those who live in all the world who hear about you and the people of Israel to be afraid and tremble concerning you.’\f + \fr 2:25 \fk you and the nation ... \ft In Hebrew verses 24-25 use ‘you’ (second-person singular) which grammatically refers to Moses only, but this message of the Lord sees Moses as the leader of the nation of Israel. Likewise, verses 27-29 use the first person singular (I = Moses), but it means that Moses and his entire nation.\f*
\p
\v 26 “Then when we arrived in the wilderness of Kedemot, I sent several men to Sihon, the king of Heshbon, to deliver a message of peace. This is my message to Sihon,
\v 27 ‘We ask that you allow us to walk through your land. We will only take the main road and will not turn aside anywhere.
\v 28 We are willing to buy food and drinking water from the people of you/Sir with money. We only ask permission to walk through the land of you.
\v 29 The descendants of Esau (Edomites) who lived in Seir and also the Moabites who lived in Ar have permitted us to pass through their country. Let us pass until we cross the Jordan River into the land that the LORD is giving us.’
\v 30 But King Sihon will not allow us to walk through his territory! The LORD our God deliberately made him stubborn so that he refused our message, because He wanted to hand him over to us. That's the reason that today we occupy his region!
\p
\v 31 “Then the LORD said to me, ‘Note this: I have begun to hand over King Sihon and his country to you. Begin to seize and take control of this country.’
\p
\v 32 “Then King Sihon and all his troops came out and attacked us in the city of Yahas.
\v 33 The Lord our God gave him up to us with all his sons and all their inhabitants so that we defeated them.
\v 34 At that time we seized all their cities and destroyed all their inhabitants - be they men, women, or their children. Not one person we left alive.
\v 35 We only took cattle and loot from the cities we have captured.
\v 36 Starting from the City of Aroer— which is located near the gorge of the River Arnon— and a city in the valley, to the Gilead region, there is not a single city whose fortress is too strong for us. The Lord God gave everything to us.
\v 37 Just the regions of Ammonite descendants— along the banks of the Jabbok River and their cities in the hills— and all the other areas that the LORD our God forbid did we not approach.”\x + \xo 2:37 \xt Deut. 2: 19\x*
