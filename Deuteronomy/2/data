\s The Israelites wander in the wilderness
\p
\v 1 “Then according to the command of the LORD to me,\x + \xo 2: 1 \xt Deut. 1:40\x* we turned and returned to the wilderness by taking the road towards the Red Sea . And we wandered for a long time around the Mountains of Seir.
\p
\v 2 “Then the LORD said to me,
\v 3 ‘You have been wandering around these mountains long enough. Go to the north
\v 4 and command the people: You will pass through the region of your brothers, the Edomites, who are the descendants of Esau who live in the region of Seir. They will be afraid of you. Because of that each of you must be vigilant!
\v 5 Don't incite them to war, because that area is not the land that I will give you— not even the slightest! I have given that land to Esau and his descendants.
\v 6 For food and even drinking water, you must buy it from them with money.
\v 7 All this time, I, the LORD your God, have blessed each of you in all your endeavors. I have been with you for the forty years you've wandered in that vast wilderness, and you haven't lacked anything.’
\p
\v 8 “So we passed through the area of our brothers the descendants of Esau who lived in the region of Seir, and we did not follow the road which goes through the Jordan River Valley, which is the road that passes through the city of Elath and Ezion Geber.\f + \fr 2: 8 \fk information about locations \ft Literally, the Jordan River Valley is called by the old name, which is 'Araba'. The two port cities, Elath and Ezion Geber, are located at the north end of the Gulf of Aqaba.\f* But we turned north toward the wilderness of Moab.
\v 9 Then the LORD said to me, ‘Do not bother the Moabites or incite them so that war results, because the Moabites are the descendants of Lot, and I have given the land of Ar\f + \fr 1: 9 \fk Ar \ft is the capital of Moab. In the past the City of Ar was known as a large city in the land of Moab, but now it is unknown where that city is.\f* to them. So from their land I will not give you even a little.’
\pi
\v 10 (The City of Ar was formerly inhabited by the Emim. Their number was large, and their bodies were large and tall like giants.\f + \fr 2:10 \fk giant \ft In this verse and verses 11 and 21, it is literally, 'Anakim', which was the name of one giant tribe.\f*
\v 11 Because they were like giants, they were considered to be Rephaim.\f + \fr 2:11 \fk Refaim \ft See the note at Gen. 14: 5\f* But the Moabites call them Emim.
\v 12 Previously the region of Seir was also inhabited by the Horites, but the descendants of Esau came in to attack and detroyed them, then occupied the land. In the same way at a later time the Israelites (will) drive away their enemies in the land which was given by the LORD to them.
\p
\v 13 Then the LORD said, “Rise up and cross Kali Zered.” So we crossed the river.
\p
\v 14 “From the time we moved to Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Stream, we had wandered for thirty eight years. And at the end, all of our soldiers of the first generation had died from among us, as the Lord had sworn regarding them.\x + \xo 2:14 \xt 1: 34-36\x*
\v 15 It was the LORD Himself that fought against them, until they all perished and vanished from the camp.
\p
\v 16 “So after all of those soldiers died,
\v 17 The Lord said to me,
\v 18 ‘Today cross the border at the city of Ar, and pass through the area of Moab until it enters the Amorite territory.\f + \fr 2:18 \fk enters … Amorite \ft The Amorite territory entered by the Israelites at this time is not written in this verse in the Hebrew language, but it is made explicit in the TSI so that the existence of various races is clarified. The two nations descended from Lot were Moab (verse 9) and Ammon (verse 19). Whereas the Israelites would be allowed to control the Amorite territory.\f*
\v 19 And when you pass through the territory of the Ammonites, do not disturb or attack them, because the Ammonites are the descendants of Lot. I have given that land to them. I will not give even the smallest bit to you from their territory.’”
\p
\v 20 (The land of Ar had been inhabited by a tribe of giants called the Refaim, but the Ammonites called them the Zamzummim.
\v 21 The many people of Rephaim were strong, and tall, but the Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonite people, so that the Ammonites captured and occupied that land.
\v 22 That situation was also the same as what the LORD did for the Edomites, who were the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir. The LORD exterminated the Horites, so that the Edomites captured the land and have settled in it until now.
\v 23 The same thing happened with the Caftor people who came from the Island of Crete. They exterminated the Avvim who previously lived along the coast of the sea up to Gaza, then controlled their territory.
\s The Israelites cross the Arnon River
\p
\v 24 “While we were passing through the area of Moab, the LORD said,‘ Get ready and cross the Arnon Valley. There you will oppose the king of the Amorite people named Sihon, who rules from the city of Heshbon. I have handed him and his country to you. Attack him and seize his country.
\v 25 Beginning today I will make all people who live in all the world who hear about you and the nation of Israel to be afraid and tremble regarding you.’\f + \fr 2:25 \fk you and the nation of Israel … \ft In the Hebrew language verses 24-25 use ‘you’ (second-person singular) which grammatically refers to Moses only, but this message of the LORD views Moses as the leader of the nation of Israel. In the same way, verses 27-29 use the first person singular (I = Moses), but it means Moses and his entire nation.\f*
\p
\v 26 “Then when we arrived in the wilderness of Kedemot, I sent several people to Sihon, the king of Heshbon, to deliver a message of peace. This is my message to Sihon,
\v 27 ‘Sir, we request that you allow us to walk through your land. We will only take the main road and will not turn aside anywhere.
\v 28 We are willing to buy food and drinking water from your people, Sir, with money. We only ask permission to walk through your land, Sir.
\v 29 The descendants of Esau (the Edomite nation) who live in Seir and also the Moabite nation who live in Ar have permitted us to pass through their country. Let us pass until we cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the LORD is giving us.’
\v 30 But King Sihon did not allow us to walk through his territory! The LORD our God deliberately made him hard headed so that he refused our message, because He wanted to hand him over to us. That's the reason that we occupy his region today!
\p
\v 31 “Then the LORD said to me, ‘Note this: I have begun to surrender King Sihon and his country to you. Begin to seize and take control of this country.’
\p
\v 32 “Then King Sihon and all of his troops came out and attacked us in the city of Jahaz.
\v 33 The Lord our God surrendered him to us with all of his sons and all of his residents so that we defeated them.
\v 34 At that time we seized all of their cities and destroyed all of their inhabitants, both men, women, and even their children. We did not leave one person alive.
\v 35 We only took cattle and loot from the cities that we captured.
\v 36 Beginning from the City of Aroer— which is located near the gorge of the River Arnon— and a city in the valley, to the Gilead region, there was not a single city whose fortress was too strong for us. The LORD God gave everything to us.
\v 37 Only we did not approach the regions of the descendants of Ammon— along the banks of the Jabbok River and their cities in the hills— and all the other areas that the LORD our God forbade.”\x + \xo 2:37 \xt Deut. 2: 19\x*
