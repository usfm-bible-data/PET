\s The Israelites wander in the wilderness
\p
\v 1 Then Moses said to the people of Israel, "Then according to the LORD's command to me,\x + \xo 2:1 \xt Deut. 1:40\x* we returned to the wilderness on the road to the Red Sea. And we wandered for a long time in the hilly area of Seir.
\p
\v 2 Then the LORD said to me,
\v 3 'You have been wandering around this hilly area long enough. It's time to head north.
\v 4 Command the people: Beware, for you will pass by the territory of your relatives, the Edomites, who are the descendants of Esau who live in the region of Seir. They will feel threatened by you,
\v 5 But do not incite them to war, for that region is not a land that I will give you, not even a little of it! I have given that land to Esau and his descendants.
\v 6 For food and drinking water, each of you must buy from them.
\v 7 Remember that all this time I, the LORD your God, have blessed you in all that you have done. I have been with you for forty years wandering in that vast wilderness, and you lacked nothing.'
\p
\v 8 "So we passed by the territory of our relatives, the descendants of Esau, who live in the region of Seir, and we did not follow the road that crosses the Jordan River Valley, that is, the road through the cities of Elath and Ezion Geber.\f + \fr 2:8 \fk information about the location \ft Literally in the Hebrew text, the Jordan River Valley is referred to by the old name, namely 'Arabah'. The two port cities, Elath and Ezion Geber, lie at the northern end of the Bay of Aqaba.\f* But we will turn north and follow the road to the wilderness of Moab.
\v 9 Then the LORD said to me, 'Do not disturb the Moabites or incite them to war, for the Moabites are the descendants of Lot, and I have already given them the land of Ar.\f + \fr 1:9 \fk Ar \ft was the capital of Moab. In the past, the city of Ar was known as a major city in the land of Moab, but now the location of the city is unknown.\f* So I will not give even a little bit of their land to you.'
\pi
\v 10 (Formerly the city of Ar was inhabited by the Emites. They were many in number, their bodies were big and tall like [the Anakites. // giants.]\f + \fr 2:10 \fk giants \ft In verses 10, 11, and 21, literally 'Anakites', which is the name of one of the tribes of the giants.\f*
\v 11 Since [that] [0 // they were like giants, they were] considered to be like the Rephaim [, /.]\f + \fr 2:11 \fk Rephaim \ft See note at Gen. 14:5\f* [b // B]ut the Moabites called them Emites.
\v 12 The area of Seir was also inhabited by the Horites, but the descendants of Esau attacked them and destroyed them, and then occupied the land. Similarly, at a later time, the Israelites drove out their enemies in the land that the LORD gave them.)
\p
\v 13 "Then the LORD said, 'Get up and cross the Zered River.' So we crossed the river.
\p
\v 14 “Since we moved from Kadesh Barnea to when we crossed the Zered River, we wandered for thirty-eight years. And in those days, all the men who were able to fight from the first generation had died, as the LORD swore concerning them.\x + \xo 2:14 \xt 1:34-36\x*
\v 15 The LORD Himself was against them, until they all passed away from among us.
\p
\v 16 "After all the soldiers died,
\v 17 The LORD said to me,
\v 18 'Today pass by the city of Ar and cross the border north of Moab,
\v 19 enter the territory of the Amorites.\f + \fr 2:19 enter the territory of the Amorites \ft Literally in Hebrew 'the territory of the Amorites' is not mentioned in this verse. TSI made this location explicit so that the existence of various nationalities could be clarified. The people of Lot's descendants are Moab (verse 9) and Ammon (verse 19), both of which could not be possessed by Israel, while the territory of the Amorites could be taken.\f* When you cross the territory of the Ammonites, do not disturb or attack them, because the Ammonites are descendants of Lot. I have given that land to them. I won't give you any of their territory.'"
\pi
\v 20 (Formerly the land of Ar was inhabited by a tribe of giants called the Rephaim, but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
\v 21 The Rephaim were strong, [# numerous, and tall like the Anakites // tall and numerous], but the LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, so that the Ammonites captured and occupied the land.
\v 22 This is also what the LORD did for the Edomites, who were the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir. The LORD destroyed the Horites, so that the Edomites took the land and live there to this day.
\v 23 The same thing happened to the Caphtor people who came from the island of Crete. They exterminated the Avvites who used to live along the sea coast as far as Gaza, then took control of their territory.)
\s The Israelites cross the Arnon River
\p
\v 24 Moses continued the story, “Then the LORD gave this commandment to me, 'Now the time has come. Cross the Arnon Valley. There you will encounter the king of the Amorites named Sihon, who rules from the city of Heshbon. I have given him and his country to you. Attack him and take his land.
\v 25 From today onwards I will make everyone everywhere fear you. When they hear news about you and the Israelites, they will tremble in fear.'\f + \fr 2:25 \fk you and the Israelites... \ft In Hebrew, verses 24-25 use 'you' (second person singular) which grammatically refers to Moses alone, but this message of the LORD was addressed to Moses as the representative of the entire nation of Israel. Likewise, in the Hebrew text, verses 27-29 use the first person singular (I = Moses), but the meaning includes Moses and all of his people.\f*
\p
\v 26 "Then, after we reached the wilderness of Kedemoth, I sent some men to Sihon, the king who ruled from the city of Heshbon, to deliver a message of peace. This was my message to Sihon,
\v 27 'We ask you to let us walk across your land. We will only go down the main road and will not deviate anywhere else.
\v 28 We are willing to buy food and drinking water from your people with money. We only ask permission to walk through your country.
\v 29 The Edomites\x + \xo 2:29 \xt Deut. 2:4\x* who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar allowed us to pass through their land. Let us pass until we cross the Jordan River and enter into the land that the LORD will give to us.'
\v 30 But King Sihon did not allow us to walk through his land. The LORD our God deliberately made the king stubborn so that he refused our message, because the LORD wanted to hand over him and his land to us. That is why we occupy the area today.
\p
\v 31 "At that time the LORD said to me, 'Look, I have begun to hand over King Sihon and his land to you. Start seizing and possessing this land.'
\p
\v 32 "Then, when King Sihon gathered all his troops and attacked us in the city of Jahaz.
\v 33 The Lord our God handed him over to us, along with all his sons and all his troops, so that we destroyed them.
\v 34 At that time we took all their cities and destroyed all their inhabitants, whether they were men, women, or their children. We let nobody live.\f + \fr 2:34 \fk destroyed... \ft The term used in Hebrew indicates that the Israelites thought that the LORD had "appointed" the people "to be destroyed". That is why no one was allowed to live. See Ex. 22:20; Lev. 27:28-29; and Deut. 7:25-26.\f*
\v 35 We only took livestock and loot from the cities that we captured.
\v 36 Starting from the town of Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley,\f + \fr 2:36 \fk Arnon Valley \ft Arnon is a river that flows into the Dead Sea and has a steep, deep canyon.\f* and a city that is in the middle of the valley as far as the region of Gilead, there was not a single city whose walls were too strong for us. The LORD God gave us all the cities in that region.
\v 37 The only area we did not go near was the region of the descendants of Ammon, along the banks of the Jabbok River and their cities in the hills, as well as all the other areas which were forbidden by the LORD God."\x + \xo 2:37 \xt Deut. 2:19\x*
