\s The Israelites wandering in the wilderness
\p
\v 1 “Then according to the commandment of the LORD to me,\x + \xo 2: 1 \xt Deut. 1:40\x* we returned to the Red Sea by way of that wilderness region. And we wandered for a long time around Mount Seir.
\p
\v 2 “Then the LORD said unto me,
\v 3 ‘You have been wandering around this mountain long enough. Go north
\v 4 and command the people: You will pass through the region of your brothers, the Edomites, who are the descendants of Esau who live in region of Seir. They will be afraid of you. Because of that each of you must be vigilant!
\v 5 Don't incite them to war, because that arena is not the land that I will give you— not even the slightest! I have given the land to Esau and his descendants.
\v 6 For food and even drinking water, you most buy it from them with money.
\v 7 All this time I, the LORD your God, have blessed each of you in all your endeavors. I have been with you for forty years you wandered in that vast wilderness, and you lacked nothing.’
\p
\v 8 “So we passed through the area of ​​our brothers of Esau descent who live in the region of Seir, and we did not follow the road which goes through the Jordan River Valley, which is the road that passes through the city of Elat and Ezion Geber.\f + \fr 2: 8 \fk information about locations \ft Literally, the Jordan River Valley is called by the old name, which is 'Araba'. The two port cities, Elat and Ezion Geber, are located at the north end of the Gulf of Akaba.\f* But we turned north toward the wilderness of Moab.
\v 9 Then the LORD said to me, ‘Do not bother the Moabites or incite them so war results, because the Moabites are descendants of Lot, and the land of Ar\f + \fr 1: 9 \fk Ar \ft is the capital of Moab. In the past the City of Ar was known as a large city in the land of Moab, but now it is unknown where that city is.\f* I have given them. So from their land I will not give you even a little.’
\pi
\v 10 (Formerly the City of Ar was inhabited by Emimites. Their number was large, and their bodies were large and tall like giants.\f + \fr 2:10 \fk giant \ft In this verse and verses 11 and 21, literally, 'Anakim', which is the name of one giant tribe.\f*
\v 11 Because they are like giants, they are considered as Rephaites.\f + \fr 2:11 \fk Refaim \ft See the note at Gen. 14: 5\f* But the Moabites call them Emimites.
\v 12 Previously Seir was also inhabited by the Horites, but the descendants of Esau came in to attack and finish them, then occupied the land. So at a later time the Israelites (will) drive away their enemies in the land which was given by the Lord to them.)
\p
\v 13 Then the LORD said, “Rise up and cross Kali Zered.” So we crossed the river.
\p
\v 14 “[From Kadesh Barnea to across Kali Zered, we wandered for 38 years. // The period of our journey - starting from Kadesh Barnea to the next to Kali Zered - took thirty-eight years.] And at that time [ all // our warriors of the first generation are dead [on the way, // there] as [the Lord has spoken to them // the LORD dwells].\x + \xo 2:14 \xt 1: 34-36\x*
\v 15 [The LORD Himself fights them until they all perish and disappear from the camp. // The Lord is the one who consumes all the warriors one by one until they disappear in our camp]
\p
\v "So after all the soldiers died,
\v 17 The Lord said to me,
\v 18 ‘[Today l // L] cross the border in the City of Ar, and pass through the area of ​​Moab until it enters the Amorite territory.\f + \fr 2:18 \fk enters ... Amorite \ft Amorite territory entered by the Israelites this time is not written in this verse in Hebrew, but it is made explicit in the TSI so that the existence of various nations is clarified. The two nations descended from Lot were Moab (verse 9) and Ammon (verse 19). While the Israelites will be allowed to control the Amorite territory.\f*
\v 19 And when you pass through [the land of] the land of the Ammonites, do not [disturb or attack / you against] them [, k //. C] the Ammonites [are] the descendants of Lot [and n //. N] I have given them the horror [0 // as theirs]. [I will not give their territories to you the slightest] ’"
\p
\v (The land of Ar was once inhabited by a tribe of giants called Refaim, but the Ammonites called them Zamzumim.
\v 21 The people of Rephaim were strong, tall and many, but the Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites, so that the Ammonites captured and occupied the land.
\v 22 This is also the same as what the LORD did for the Edomites, that is, descendants of Esau who lived in [Seir // Edom region]. The LORD exterminated the Horites, so that the Edomites captured the land and have settled in it until now.
\v 23 The same thing happened with the Caftor people who came from the island of Crete. They exterminated the Awis who lived along the [coast // coast] of the sea to Gaza, then [controlled their territory // the whole territory was controlled by the Kaftor people].)
\s [The Israelites crossing the Arnon River
\p
\v 24 “While we were passing through the area of ​​Moab, the LORD said,‘ Get ready and cross the Arnon River. There you will oppose with the Amorite king Sihon, who ruled from the city of Hesbon. I have handed him and [his country to you // his kingdom into your hands]. Attack him and [seize // capture] his country.
\v 25 From today [I will make] all those who live in all the world, who hear about you and the people of Israel [0 //] will be afraid and tremble with you. '\f + \fr 2:25 \fk you and the nation ... \ft In Hebrew verses 24-25 use 'you' (second-person singular) which grammatically refers to Moses only, but this message of the Lord sees Moses as the leader of the nation of Israel. Likewise, verses 27-29 use the first person singular (I = Moses), but it means that Moses and his entire nation.\f*
\p
\v 26 “Then when we arrived in the wilderness of Kedemot, I sent several [0 // of us] to Sihon [, r // R] wrote Hesbon to deliver the message of peace. This is my message to Sihon,
\v 27 ‘We ask [that] you allow us to walk through your land. We [will only take the main road and will not wander anywhere // follow the public road, and not go anywhere else].
\v 28 We are willing to buy food [0 // food] and drinking water from the people of Tuan with money. We only ask permission to walk through the land of Tuan [0 // only].
\v 29 The descendants of Esau (Edomites) who lived in the [0 // mountainous region] of Seir [and also the Moabites who lived in Ar] had permitted us to pass through their country. [0 // Likewise the inhabitants of the Moabites who lived around the city of Ar permitted us to pass through.] [Let us pass until we // We want to] cross the Jordan River [to // enter] into the land that the LORD is giving us '
\v 30 But King Sihon will not allow us to walk through his territory! The LORD our God deliberately made him [stubborn and] refused our message, [because He wanted to hand it over to us // so we could defeat him and live in his area]. That's why today we occupy this area!
\p
\v 31 “Then the LORD said to me," Pay attention, I have begun to hand over King Sihon and his country to you. Begin to seize and [seize control of this country // occupy this region so you can rule]. '
\p
\v 32 “Then King Sihon and all [his army // people from that city] came out [and // then] attacked us in the City of Yahas.
\v 33 The Lord our God gave him up with all his sons and all their inhabitants [to us] so that we defeated them.
\v 34 At that time we [seized // seized all their cities, and destroyed all their inhabitants - be they men, women or their children. No one [we leave // ​​left] lives.
\v 35 [We only take cattle and loot // We only take their livestock as loot] from the cities we have captured.
\v 36 Starting from the City of Aroer - which is located near the gorge of the River Arnon - and a city in the valley, to the Gilead region, there is not a single city whose fortress is too strong for us. The Lord God gave everything to us.
\v 37 Ammonite descent only [- along the banks of the Jabbok River and their cities in the hills - // and all their cities in the hills to the river near Yapok alone] [and all the areas that the LORD our God forbids us to ban we do not approach // that which we do not disturb, according to the command of the Lord our God].”x + \xo 2:37 \xt Deut. 2: 19 \x*
