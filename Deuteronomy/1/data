\s Introduction
\p
\v 1 These are the words which were conveyed by Moses to all the people of Israel in the wilderness, east of the Jordan River, when they camped in the Jordan Valley near the City of Suf. From where they camped, the City of Paran was on one side, while the City of Tofel, the City of Laban, the City of Hazerot and the City of Disahab were on the opposite side.
\p
\v 2 In fact, the journey from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-Barnea is only eleven days when passing a shortcut in the Seir Mountains.
\v 3 On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, Moses delivered all the commands he had received from the LORD before all Israel.
\v 4 Moses said all this after the Israelites defeated Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled in the city of Hesbon, and Og, the king of the Bashans who ruled in the city of Astaroth and the city of Edrei.
\p
\v 5 So to the east of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain the laws of the LORD, he said,
\p
\v 6 "Back then, when we were at Mount Sinai, the LORD God told us,‘ You have been living on this mountain for a long time.
\v 7 Now pack up and continue your journey to the hilly country of the Amorites and to the surrounding area in all of the land of Canaan, including the Jordan Valley, the region with smaller hills to the west, and other hilly regions. Included also is the large region of wilderness to the south, to the coast of Mediterranean, and again northward to the Lebanon mountains, and eastward to the great river, the Euphrates River.
\v 8 Know that I have given the land to you through the covenant I made to your ancestors — Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that I will give it to them and to their descendants from generation to generation. So go and rule over the land.’”
\s Moses reexplained the reason for appointing Judges
\p
\v 9 Then Moses continued, “At that time, I said to you,” I’m not able to lead all of you alone.
\v 10 Our LORD God has increased your numbers — like the number of stars in the sky.
\v 11 Yes, may the LORD God our ancestors will add to the number of your children and grandchildren a thousand times more, and also make us a prosperous nation as He promised!
\v 12 But how can I on my own be able to bear the enormous task of solving all your problems?
\v 13 Choose wise, understanding and respected people from each tribe, so that I appoint them to be leaders over you.’
\p
\v 14 “At that time you (pl) answered, ‘That's a good plan!’
\v 15 So I appointed leaders for each of your tribes, to rule over over a thousand people, one hundred people, fifty people and ten people. Each leader was well known to be a wise person.
\p
\v 16 And after being inaugurated, I instructed them, ‘Each of you must help your brothers to deal with the various problems between them, and must be fair in deciding the problems that occur between a person with his sibling or with a foreigner living with him.
\v 17 You must be honest. Don't be biased when deciding each case. Do not be afraid of anyone’s anger because of your demision, because God will lead you so that your decisions are according to His will. But if there is a serious case that you can't solve, bring it to me so that I decide.’
\v 18 At that time I also taught you all of you things that you must do.”
\s Moses reminded of the twelve men — spies of the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 19 “Remember also that when we were on Mount Sinai, our Lord God commanded us to move from that mountain. So we came out of there and passed through the vast and terrible wilderness— which you remember— towards the hilly region of the Amorites, until we arrived at Kadesh Barnea.
\v 20 When we arrived at Kadesh Barnea, I said to you, ‘We have arrived in the hilly region which is inhabited by the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving to us.
\v 21 Know this: The LORD our God has given this land over to you. Enter it and rule over the land, as commanded by the LORD the God of your ancestors. Do not be afraid and despair!’
\p
\v 22 “Then you all drew near to me and said, ‘Then let us send some of us in order to [spy out//investigate] the condition of that country, and [report//inform] us about the road we most pass through and the cities we will face.’
\p
\v 23 “I agreed with this proposal. So I chose twelve from among us, one from each tribe.
\v 24 They went there through that hilly region until they arrived at the Eshcol Valley, which they exlored.
\v 25 Then they returned to us bringing fruits from that land, and said, ‘The land which the Lord God is giving to us is very fertile!’
\p
\v 26 "But each of you didn't want to go to that country. You rebelled against the command of the Lord our God.
\v 27 In your tent each of you complains and says, ‘Ah, apparently the Lord brought us out of Egypt, because He hates us. He wants to deliver us to the Amorite people so that they will destroy us.
\v 28 We will be wiped out if we go to that country! The report of the twelve men has made us afraid. They said, “Th people there are aller and stronger than we are. Their cities there are big and circled by a wall that is as high as heaven! And the residents are giant people!”’
\p
\v 29 “But I say to you,‘ Don’t be afraid of them!
\v 30 The LORD God will go before us us in this war and fight for us, as we already saw He did in Egypt
\v 31 and in the region of wilderness. So you yourselves have witnessed the way God has accompanied us to this place, like a father carries his own child.
\p
\v 32 “Even though I said that, you still didn't believe that God is faithful and able to help us,\f + \fr 1:32 \fk didn’t believe that ... \ft Literally ‘did not believe God’. The problem is not that the people of Israel did not believe ‘in’ the Lord. Even though they believed that God exists, they refused to believe that God will continue to be faithful and powerful to help them possess the land of Canaan, according to the commands He gave through Moses.\f*
\v 33 although he was with you all the way here, illuminated you with a pillar of fire at night, protected you from the heat of the sun during the day, and showed you your campsite during the journey you traveled.”
\s The anger of the LORD
\p
\v 34 “The Lord had heard all the words that you said, so He was angry and said,
\v 35 ‘Even though I promised your ancestors that you will inherit the land, but because you are so evil I will not allow any of you to enter the land!
\v 36 Only Caleb the son of Jephune and his descendants was permitted to enter the land which he had explored, because Caleb had obeyed my command.’
\p
\v 37 “Because of your deeds, I have violated one of the Lord's commands, so that the LORD will be angry with me, He said, ‘Moses, you will not enter the land either.
\v 38 But Joshua the son of Nun, your servant, is he who will go into the land. So strengthen his heart so that he may lead the people of Israel into the land.
\v 39 It is your children who are young, who do not know anything, and who you say your enemies will take away if they enter the land, they will enter and own the country!
\v 40 But you, return to the wilderness near the Red Sea! ’
\p
\v 41 "Then you say,‘ We have sinned against the LORD! We will depart to fight against those people as the LORD our God has commanded. 'Then each of you prepare your weapons for battle, because you think it is easy to defeat the enemies that are around the hilly area.
\p
\v 42 “But the Lord said to me, ‘Tell them not to go to war, because this time I will not help them. They will be defeated by their enemies.’
\p
\v 43 “Then I convey the message to you, but you pretend you didn't hear. You defy the Lord's commands, and you arrogantly go to the mountains.
\v 44 Then the Amorites who lived in the mountains came out and attacked you like bees, they chased and killed our army from Seir to Horma.
\v 45 Then you come back and weep before the Lord, but the Lord does not want to hear or pay attention to you.
\v 46 That's why we stayed for a long time in the Village Head-Barnea.”
