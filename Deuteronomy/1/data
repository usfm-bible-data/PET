\s Introduction
\p
\v 1 These are the words which were conveyed by Moses to all the people of Israel in the wilderness, east of the Jordan River, when they camped in the Jordan Valley near the City of Suf. From where they camped, the City of Paran was on one side, while the City of Tofel, the City of Laban, the City of Hazerot and the City of Disahab were on the opposite side.
\p
\v 2 In fact, the journey from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-Barnea is only eleven days when passing a shortcut in the Seir Mountains.
\v 3 On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, Moses delivered all the commands he had received from the LORD before all Israel.
\v 4 Moses said all this after the Israelites defeated Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled in the city of Hesbon, and Og, the king of the Bashans who ruled in the city of Astaroth and the city of Edrei.
\p
\v 5 So to the east of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain the laws of the LORD, he said,
\p
\v 6 "Back then, when we were at Mount Sinai, the LORD God told us,‘ You have been living on this mountain for a long time.
\v 7 Now pack up and continue your journey to the hilly country of the Amorites and to the surrounding area in all of the land of Canaan, including the Jordan Valley, the region with smaller hills to the west, and other hilly regions. Included also is the large region of wilderness to the south, to the coast of Mediterranean, and again northward to the Lebanon mountains, and eastward to the great river, the Euphrates River.
\v 8 Know that I have given the land to you through the covenant I made to your ancestors — Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that I will give it to them and to their descendants from generation to generation. So go and rule over the land.’”
\s Moses reexplained the reason for appointing Judges
\p
\v 9 Then Moses continued, “At that time, I said to you,” I’m not able to lead all of you alone.
\v 10 Our LORD God has increased your numbers — like the number of stars in the sky.
\v 11 Yes, may the LORD God our ancestors will add to the number of your children and grandchildren a thousand times more, and also make us a prosperous nation as He promised!
\v 12 But how can I on my own be able to bear the big task of solving all your problems?
\v 13 Choose men from each tribe who are wise, understanding, and respected, and I will appoint them to be leaders over you.’
\p
\v 14 “At that time you (pl) answered, ‘That's a good plan!’
\v 15 So I appointed wise and respected leaders for each of your tribes, to rule over over a thousand people, one hundred people, fifty people and ten people.
\p
\v 16 And after being inaugurated, I instructed them, ‘Each of you must help your people to deal with the various problems between them, and must be fair in deciding the problems that occur between a person with his sibling or with a foreigner living with him.
\v 17 You must be honest. Don't be biased when deciding each case. Do not be afraid of anyone’s anger because of your demision, because God will lead you so that your decisions are according to His will. But if there is a serious case that you can't solve, bring it to me so that I decide.’
\v 18 At that time I also taught you all of you things that you must do.”
\s Moses reminded of the twelve men — spies of the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 19 “Remember also that when we were on Mount Sinai, our Lord God commanded us to move from that mountain. So we came out of there and passed through the vast and terrible wilderness— which you remember— towards the hilly region of the Amorites, until we arrived at Kadesh Barnea.
\v 20 When we arrived at Kadesh Barnea, I said to you, ‘We have arrived in the hilly region which is inhabited by the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving to us.
\v 21 Know this: The LORD our God has given this land over to you. Enter it and rule over the land, as commanded by the LORD the God of your ancestors. Do not be afraid and despair!’
\p
\v 22 “Then you all drew near to me and said, ‘Then let us send some of us in order to spy out the condition of that country, and report us about the road we most pass through and the cities we will face.’
\p
\v 23 “I agreed with this proposal. So I chose twelve from among us, one from each tribe.
\v 24 They went there through that hilly region until they arrived at the Eshcol Valley, which they exlored.
\v 25 Then they returned to us bringing fruits from that land, and said, ‘The land which the Lord God is giving to us is very fertile!’
\p
\v 26 “But each of you didn't want to go to that country. You rebelled against the command of the Lord our God.
\v 27 In your tent each of you complains and says, ‘Oh, apparently the Lord brought us out of Egypt because He hates us. He wants to deliver us to the Amorite people so that they will destroy us.
\v 28 We will be wiped out if we go to that country! The report of the twelve men has made us afraid. They said, “The people there are taller and stronger than we are. Their cities there are big and circled by a wall that is as high as the sky! And the residents are giant people!”’
\p
\v 29 “But I said to you, ‘Don’t be afraid of them!
\v 30 The LORD God will go before us us in this war and fight for us, as you already saw He did in Egypt
\v 31 and in the wilderness. So you yourselves have witnessed the way God has accompanied us to this place, like a father carries his own child.
\p
\v 32 “Even though I said that, you still didn't believe that God is faithful and able to help us,\f + \fr 1:32 \fk didn’t believe that ... \ft Literally ‘did not believe God’. The problem is not that the people of Israel did not believe ‘in’ the Lord. Even though they believed that God exists, they refused to believe that God will continue to be faithful and powerful to help them possess the land of Canaan, according to the commands He gave through Moses.\f*
\v 33 although he was always walking in front of you to show the road you need to go through and to look for a camping site for you. He contiually illuminated you with a pillar of fire at night, and protected you from the heat of the sun with a pillar of cloud during the day.”
\s The anger of the LORD
\p
\v 34 “When the Lord heard what you said, He was angry and made an oath,
\v 35 ‘Not even one from this evil generation will see the good land that I promised to their ancestors for them to possess!
\v 36 Only Caleb the son of Jephune will see that land. I will give to him and his decendants the land that he explored, because he fully obeyed my command.’
\p
\v 37 “Because of your deeds, I have violated one of the Lord's commands, so that the LORD will be angry with me, He said, ‘Moses, you will not enter the land either.
\v 38 But Joshua the son of Nun, your assitant, will go into that land. So strengthen his heart because he will lead the people of Israel to take control of that land.
\v 39 It is your children who are young— who do not know anything and who you say your enemies will take away if they enter the land— they will enter and possess that country! A will gave it to them.
\v 40 But you, return again to the Red Sea by way of the wilderness. ’
\p
\v 41 “Then you said, ‘We have sinned against the LORD! We will depart to make war as the LORD our God has commanded.’ Then each of you prepared your weapons, because you thought that winning that hilly region was an easy thing to do.
\p
\v 42 “But the Lord said to me, ‘Tell them not to go to war, because I am not going with them. They will be defeated by their enemies.’
\p
\v 43 “Then I convey the message to you, but you pretended not to hear. You defied the Lord's command and arrogantly went to the hilly region.
\v 44 Then the Amorites who lived in the hilly region came out and attacked you like an attack of bees. They chased and wiped out our soldiers from Seir to Horma.
\v 45 Then you come back and mourned before the Lord, but the Lord did not want to hear or pay attention to you.
\v 46 So, we stayed for a long time in the Kades-Barnea, that is the whole time that was determined by the Lord.”\f + \fr 1:46 \fk full time … \ft Literally, ‘the length of time you lived (there)’. This phrase refers to the period of time Frasa ini merujuk kepada jangka waktu empat puluh tahun pengembaraan yang dijatuhkan TUHAN sebagai hukuman atas ketidak-percayaan mereka. Lihat Num. 14:33-34; 32:13.\f*
