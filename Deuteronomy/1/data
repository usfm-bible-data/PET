\s (The) Forty-fourth year after the Israel nation came out of Egypt
\p
\v 1 These are the words which were conveyed by Moses to all the people of Israel in the wilderness, east of the Jordan River, at the time they camped in the Jordan Valley near the city of Suph. From where they camped, the city of Paran was on one side, while the cities of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab were on the opposite side.
\p
\v 2 In fact, the journey from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-Barnea was only eleven days when passing a shortcut in the Seir Mountains.
\v 3 But Moses delivered all the lessons in this book on the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. Moses delivered all the commands that he had received from the LORD before all Israel.
\v 4 Moses conveyed all these lessons of this when the Israelites defeated King Sihon and King Og. Sihon was the king of the Amorites whom previously had ruled in the city of Heshbon, and Og, was the king whom had previously ruled over the region of Bashan from the city of Ashtaroth and the city of Edrei.
\p
\v 5 So to the east of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain the laws of the LORD, he said,
\p
\v 6 “Back then, when we were at Mount Sinai, the LORD God told us,‘ You have been living at the foot of this mountain for a long time.
\v 7 Now continue your journey to the hilly area of the Amorites and to the surrounding area in all of the land of Canaan, including the Jordan Valley, the region of smaller hills to the west, and other hilly regions. Included also was the broad region of wilderness to the south, up to the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, and northward to the broad area of the Lebanon mountains, and eastward to the great river, the Euphrates River.
\v 8 Know that I have given that land to you through the covenant I made to your ancestors — Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that I will give it to them and to their descendants from generation to generation. So go and occupy the land.’”
\s Moses appointed the leaders from each tribe
\p
\v 9 Then Moses continued, “At that time, I said to all of you,” I’m not able to lead all of you alone.
\v 10 The LORD our God has increased your numbers — like the number of stars in the sky.
\v 11 Yes, may the LORD God of our ancestors add to the number of your children and grandchildren a thousand times more, and also make us a prosperous nation as He had promised!
\v 12 But how can I on my own be able to bear the great task of solving all of your problems and cases?
\v 13 Then at that time, I told each tribe to choose a few leaders, according to the number of tribes so that I could appoint them. To become a leader, must be a man with wisdom, understanding and experience.Choose men from each tribe who are wise, understanding, and who are respected, so that I can appoint them to become leaders over you.’
\p
\v 14 “At that time you (pl) answered, ‘That's a good plan!’
\v 15 So I appointed wise and respected peoples as leaders for each of your tribes, Some were appointed as heads of troops to lead over a thousand people, over one hundred people, over fifty people and over ten people.
\p
\v 16 And after being inaugurated, I instructed them, ‘Each of you must help your people to settle the various problems between them, and must be fair in deciding the problems that occur between a person with his relative or with a foreigner living among you.
\v 17 You must be honest. Don't be biased when deciding each case. Be fair to everyone, to the rich or to the poor. Don't be afraid of anyone’s anger because of your decision, because God will lead you so that your decisions are according to His will. But if there is a serious problem that you can't settle, bring it to me so that I decide it.’
\s Commisioning twelve spies to the land of Canaan
\v 18-19 Moses continued, “At that time at the foot of Mount Sinai I also taught all of you about all the things that you must do. Then the Lord our God told us to move from that mountain. So we went out from there and headed to the hilly area of the Amorites. And as you remember, we went through the broad and terrible wildernes util we arrived at Kadesh Barnea
\v 20 After we arrived at Kadesh Barnea, I said to you, ‘We have arrived in the hilly region which is inhabited by the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving to us.
\v 21 Know this, the LORD, God of our ancestors has handed over this land to us. Enter it and occupy the land, as commanded by the LORD. Do not be afraid and don't despair!’
\p
\v 22 “But then you all came to me and suggested, ‘Let us send some people to go ahead of us to spy out the condition of that country, and report to us about the road we must pass through and the cities we will face.’
\p
\v 23 “I agree, that is a good suggestion. So I chose twelve people from among us, one person from each tribe.
\v 24 They went there passing through that hilly region until they arrived at the Eshcol Valley, and they exlored that area.
\v 25 Then they returned to us bringing fruits from that land, and reported, ‘The land which the LORD God is giving to us is very good!’
\p
\v 26 “But you didn't want to go to that country. You rebelled against the command of the LORD our God.
\v 27 In your tents each of you complains and says, ‘Oh, clearly the LORD brought us out of Egypt because He hates us. He wants to surrender us to the Amorite people so that they will destroy us.
\v 28 If we enter that land, we will be killed. We were afrain because the report from those twelve men that have gone there to spy. They said, “The residents there are giants! They are taller and stronger than we are. Their cities there are big and surrounded by a wall that is as high as the sky!”’
\p
\v 29 “But I said to you all, ‘Don’t be afraid of them!
\v 30 The LORD our God will go before us us in this war and fight for us, as He had done in Egypt in front of our eyes!
\v 31 and in the wilderness. So you yourselves have witnessed the way God has accompanied us to this place, like a father carries his own child.
\p
\v 32 “Even though I said that, you still didn't believe that the LORD your God is faithful and able to help us,\f + \fr 1:32 \fk didn’t believe that … \ft Literally ‘did not believe the LORD’. The problem is not that the people of Israel did not believe ‘in’ the LORD. Even though they believed that the LORD exists, they refused to believe that God would continue to be faithful and powerful to help them to dominate the land of Canaan, according to the commands He gave through Moses.\f*
\v 33 although He, with a pillar of fire at night and pillar of cloud during the day, always walking in front of each of us to show the road you need to take with a pillar of fire at nighttime, to find a place for you to camp.”
\s The anger of the LORD
\p
\v 34 “When the LORD heard what you said, He was angry and made an oath,
\v 35 ‘Not even one person of this evil generation will see the good land that I promised to their ancestors for them to possess!
\v 36 Only Caleb the son of Jephunneh will see that land. I will give to him and his decendants the land that he explored, because he fully obeyed My command.’
\p
\v 37 “Because you were so hard headed, I violated one of the LORD's commands, so that the LORD was angry with me too, and said to me, ‘You (sg) will not enter that land either.
\v 38 But Joshua the son of Nun, your right hand man, will enter that land. So strengthen his heart because he will lead the people of Israel to take control of that land.
\v 39 It is your children who are young— who do not yet know anything and who you say will be taken away by your enemies if they enter that land— they will enter and possess that land! I will give it to them.
\v 40 But you, turn around and return to the wilderness by way of the Red Sea road. ’
\p
\v 41 “Then you said, ‘We have sinned against the LORD! We will depart to make war as the LORD our God has commanded.’ Then each of you prepared your weapons, because you thought that taking that hilly region was an easy thing to do.
\p
\v 42 “But the LORD said to me, ‘Tell them not to go forward to war, because I am not with them. They will be defeated by their enemies.’
\p
\v 43 “Then I conveyed that message to you, but you pretended not to hear. You rebelled against the LORD's command and arrogantly went to the hilly region.
\v 44 Then the Amorites who lived in the hilly region came out and attacked you all like a swarm of bees. They chased and wiped out our soldiers from Seir to Horma.
\v 45 Then you came back and mourned before the LORD, but the LORD did not want to pay attention to you.
\v 46 So, we stayed for a long time in Kadesh-Barnea, that is the whole time that was determined by the LORD.”\f + \fr 1:46 \fk full time … \ft Literally, ‘the length of time you live (there)’. This phrase refers to the forty year period of time of wandering which was the punishment given by the LORD for their unbelief. See Num. 14:33-34; 32:13.\f*
