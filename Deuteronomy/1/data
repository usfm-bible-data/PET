\s The fortieth year after the Israelites left Egypt
\p
\v 1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan River, when they camped in the Jordan Valley near the city of Suph. From where they had camped, the city of Paran was on one side, while the cities of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab were on the other.
\p
\v 2 The journey from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea is only eleven days if you take a shortcut in the Seir Mountains.
\v 3 On the first day, eleventh month, fortieth year after the Israelites left Egypt, Moses began to teach all the lessons in this book, according to the LORD's command to him.
\v 4 All of this was taught by Moses when the Israelites had already defeated King Sihon and King Og. Sihon was the king of the Amorites who had previously ruled the city of Heshbon, and Og was the king who had previously ruled the area of Bashan from the city of Ashtaroth and the city of Edrei.
\p
\v 5 When the Israelites were east of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began explaining the following laws of the LORD.
\p
\v 6 "In the past, when we were at Mount Sinai, the LORD our God said to us, 'You have been living at the foot of this mountain long enough.
\v 7 Now continue your journey
\li2 to the hills of the Amorites,
\li2 and to the surrounding area throughout the land of Canaan,
\li2 including the Jordan Valley,
\li2 to the hilly area to the west,
\li2 and other hilly areas.
\li2 To be included also is the large area in the wilderness to the south,
\li2 to the edge of the Mediterranean,
\li2 and north again to the mountains of Lebanon,
\li2 and on to the east as far as the great river, which is the Euphrates River.
\v 8 See, I have given this land to you through the covenant I made with your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. So go in and rule the country.’"
\s Moses appoints the leaders of each tribe
\p
\v 9 Moses continued, “At that time, I said to you, 'I alone cannot lead you all.
\v 10 The LORD our God has multiplied your number, as the multitude of the stars in the sky.
\v 11 Yes, may the LORD, the God of our ancestors, increase the number of your children and grandchildren to a thousand times, and also make us a prosperous nation as He has promised!
\v 12 But, how can I alone take on such a huge task to solve all your problems and troubles?!'
\v 13-15 So at that time I ordered that each tribe select several people to be appointed to lead a thousand people, one hundred people, fifty people, and ten people in each tribe. The leader must be a man who is wise, understanding, and experienced. Then you said, 'That's a good plan!' So I installed those people as your leaders.
\p
\v 16 When they were appointed, I told them, 'Each of you must help your people to settle the various cases between them, and must be fair in deciding every problem that occurs, whether between a person and his brother, or between an Israelite and a foreigner who lives among you.
\v 17 You have to be honest! Don't take sides when deciding each case. Be fair to everyone, rich and poor alike. Don't be afraid to be scolded by anyone for your decision, because God will lead you so that your decision is according to His will. However, if there is a serious problem that you cannot solve, bring it to me so that I am the one who decides it.'"
\s The dispatch of twelve spies to the land of Canaan
\p
\v 18-19 Then Moses said, "At that time, at the foot of Mount Sinai I taught you about various other things you must do. Then the LORD our God commanded us to move away from the mountain. So we left from there into the hill country of the Amorites. And as you remember, we passed through a vast and terrible wilderness until we came to Kadesh Barnea.
\v 20 After arriving at Kadesh Barnea, I said to you, 'We have arrived at the hilly area inhabited by the Amorites, a land that the LORD will soon give to us.
\v 21 See, the LORD God of our fathers has given us this land. Go in and rule the land, just as the LORD has commanded us. Don't be afraid and don't give up!'
\p
\v 22 "But then all of you came to me and suggested, 'Let us get some people to go ahead of us and spy out the land, and then report to us about the roads we must walk and the cities we will face.'
\p
\v 23 "I agreed with the proposal. So I chose twelve people, that is, one person from each tribe.
\v 24 They went there through the hilly region, until they came to the Eschol Valley, and they explored that region.
\v 25 Then they returned to us with the fruit of that land and reported, 'The land that the LORD gave us is indeed very good.'
\p
\v 26 “But you didn't want to go to that land! You rebelled against the commandment of the LORD our God!
\v 27 In each of your tents, you grumbled and said, 'Ah, it turns out that the LORD brought us out of Egypt because He hates us. He wants to hand us over to the Amorites so that they can destroy us.
\v 28 If we enter the land, we will be killed! We are scared because of the reports from the twelve people who spied there. They said, 'The people there are taller and stronger than us. Their cities are huge and surrounded by walls that [towering // high up] to the sky! In fact we saw the giants there, that is, the descendants of Anak.’"
\p
\v 29 "But I said to you, 'Don't be afraid of them!
\v 30 The LORD our God will go before us and fight for us, as He did in Egypt before our own eyes!
\v 31 Likewise on our journey through the wilderness, [# you // each of you] have witnessed how God was with us [#. He // came to this place,] like a father [# who] carries his own child [# until we get to this place].'
\p
\v 32 "Even though I said this, you still do not believe that our LORD God is faithful and able to help us,
\v 33 although He — with a pillar of fire at night and a pillar of cloud by day — always goes before us to show us the way to go, and to show you the place of camp."
\s The anger of the LORD
\p
\v 34 Moses continued, "When the LORD heard what you said, He was angry and swore,
\v 35 ʻNone of this wicked generation will see the good land that I promised their ancestors to have!
\v 36 Only Caleb son of Jephunneh\x + \xo 1:36 \xt Num. 13-14\x* alone will see the land. To him and his descendants I will give the land which he has explored, for he obeyed My commandment with all his heart.'
\p
\v 37 "Because you were so stubborn, I broke one of the LORD's commands, so the LORD was angry with me and said, 'You also will not enter the land!\x + \xo 1:37 \xt Num. 20:1-12\x*
\v 38 But Joshua son of Nun, your right hand man, will enter the land. So be strong because he will lead the Israelites to rule the land.'
\v 39 Then the LORD also said to all of you, 'Your little children — who do not know anything and whom you think the enemy will take away when you enter the land — they will enter and own the land! I'll give it to them.
\v 40 But you, turn around and go back into the wilderness on the road to the Red Sea!'
\p
\v 41 "Then you said, 'We have sinned against the LORD! We will go to war according to the commandment of the LORD our God.' Then you prepared your weapons, because you thought it was easy to take the hilly area.
\p
\v 42 "But the LORD said to me, 'Tell them not to go to war, for I will not be with them. They will be defeated by the enemy.'
\p
\v 43 "So I conveyed the message to you, but you didn't want to listen. You rebelled against the LORD's commandment and arrogantly went into the hill country.
\v 44 Then the Amorites who live there swarmed at you like a swarm of bees. They chased and slaughtered our troops from Seir to Hormah.
\v 45 Then you returned and wailed before the LORD, but the LORD did not want to pay any attention to you.
\v 46 So, we stayed at Kadesh Barnea for the time that the LORD appointed.”\f + \fr 1:46 \fk for the time…\ft Literally, 'the whole time you lived (there)'. This phrase refers to a period of forty years of wandering as the LORD's punishment for their unbelief. See Num. 14:33-34; 32:13.\f*
