\s Introduction
\p
\v 1 These are the words which were conveyed by Moses to all the people of Israel in the wilderness, east of the Jordan River, when they camped in the Jordan Valley near the City of Suf. From where they camped, the City of Paran was on one side, while the City of Tofel, the City of Laban, the City of Hazerot and the City of Disahab were on the opposite side.
\p
\v 2 In fact, the journey from Mount Sinai to Kadesh-Barnea is only eleven days when passing a shortcut in the Seir Mountains.
\p
\v 3 On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt, Moses delivered all the commands he had received from the Lord before all Israel.
\p 4 Moses said all this after the Israelites defeated Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled in the city of Hesbon, and Og, the king of the Bashans who ruled in the city of Astaroth and the city of Edrei.
\p
\v 5 So to the east of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain the laws of the LORD, he said,
\p
\v 6 "Back then, when we were at Mount Sinai, the Lord God told us,‘ You have been living on this mountain for a long time.
\p
\v 7 Now pack up and continue your journey to the mountains of the Amorites and to the surrounding area in the Jordan Valley. Then go down to the Mediterranean and land in the south. Then up to the mountains of Lebanon and eastward, to the great river, the Euphrates River.
\v 8 Know that I have given the land to you through the covenant I made to your ancestors - Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, that I will give it to them and to their descendants from generation to generation. So go and rule the country. '" Moses explained the reason for appointing Judges
\p
\v 9 Then Moses continued, "And at that very moment, right after the LORD commanded us to leave Mount Sinai, I said to you," To lead all of you is a very big work for me. I can't do it alone.
\v 10 Our Lord God has increased your numbers — like the number of stars in the sky.
\v 11 Yes, I pray that the Lord God our ancestors will add to the number of your children and grandchildren more, and also make us a prosperous nation as He promised!
\v 12 But how can I on my own be able to bear the enormous task of solving all your problems?
\v 13 Choose wise, understanding and respected people from each tribe, so that I appoint them to be leaders over you. '
\p
\v 14 "At that time you guys answered, 'That's a good plan!'
\p
\v 15 "Therefore I have appointed them according to your choice, and I have appointed your leaders over one thousand, one hundred, fifty and ten, so that they will lead you according to your tribes.
\v 16 And after being inaugurated, I told them, 'You must help your brothers in dealing with the various problems that occur between them, and must be fair in deciding the problems that occur between a person with his siblings or with strangers living with him.
\v 17 You must be honest, don't be biased when deciding on everyone's problems. Do not be afraid to be reprimanded by someone for that decision, because if you are honest then God will help you. But if there is a serious problem that you can't solve, bring it to me so that I decide. '
\v 18 That is what I ordered to your leaders, but at that time I also taught all of you things that you must do. " Moses reminded of the twelve men — spies of the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 19 "Remember also that when we were on Mount Sinai, our Lord God commanded us to move from that mountain. So we came out of there and passed through the Amorite hill country, and again through the vast and terrible wilderness - which you remember, until we arrived at Kadesh-Barnea.
\v 20 After we arrived at Kadesh-Barnea, I say to you, ‘This area is now inhabited by Amorites, but the Lord our God has given it to us.
\v 21 I repeat: The LORD our God has given this land to you. Do not be afraid and despair. Now you have the right to enter and control the country. '
\p
\v 22 "After you heard that, you said, 'Then let us send some of us to that land, so that they go and investigate the condition of the land, how far we will go, and how many more cities will we go face later. '
\p
\v 23 "I agree with this proposal. So I chose twelve of you, one from each tribe.
\v 24 After that I told them to go to the country to investigate. And they went there through the mountains until they came to the Eshcol.
\v 25 After they returned to us, they showed the fruit they had brought as proof of the condition of the land and said, "The land given by the Lord our God is very fertile!"
\p
\v "But you don't want to go to that country. You rebel against the command of the Lord our God.
\v 27 In your tent each of you complains and says, ‘Ah, apparently the Lord brought us out of Egypt, because He hates us. He finishes us through the attacks of the Amorites.
\v 28 We could be killed completely if we go to that country. Because in the report of the twelve, they said that the cities there were in a strong and high wall. Even the people there are taller than us - giant people! ’
\p
\v 29 "But I say to you,‘ Do not be afraid of those people!
\v 30 It is the LORD God who will help and lead us in battle — just like everything you have seen He did to the Egyptians.
\v 31 You have seen a lot of the way God is with us during our journey in this mountainous region. The LORD our God brought you to this place like a father holding his own child. '
\p
\v 32 "Even though I have said that, you still don't believe that God is faithful and able to help us. \f + \fr 1:32 \fk do not believe that ... \ft Literally ‘do not trust God’. The problem is not that the people of Israel do not believe in the Lord. Even though they believe that God exists, they refuse to believe that God will continue to be faithful and powerful to help them control the land of Canaan, according to the commands he gave through Moses.\f*
\v 33 although he was with you all the way here, illuminated you with a pillar of fire at night, protected you from the heat of the sun during the day, and showed you your campsite during the journey you traveled. "
\s Anger of the LORD
\p
\v 34 “The Lord has heard all the words that you say, so He is angry and says,
\v 35 ‘Even though I promised your ancestors that you will inherit the land, but because you are so evil I will not allow any of you to enter the land!
\v 36 Only Caleb the son of Jephune and his descendants was permitted to enter the land which he had explored, because Caleb had obeyed my command. '
\p
\v 37 “Because of your deeds, I have violated one of the Lord's commands, so that the LORD will be angry with me, He said, ‘Moses, you will not enter the land either.
\v 38 But Joshua the son of Nun, your servant, is he who will go into the land. So strengthen his heart so that he may lead the people of Israel into the land.
\v 39 It is your children who are young, who do not know anything, and who you say your enemies will take away if they enter the land, they will enter and own the country!
\v 40 But you, return to the wilderness near the Red Sea! ’
\p
\v 41 "Then you say,‘ We have sinned against the LORD! We will depart to fight against those people as the LORD our God has commanded. 'Then each of you prepare your weapons for battle, because you think it is easy to defeat the enemies that are around the hilly area.
\p
\v 42 “But the Lord said to me, ‘Tell them not to go to war, because this time I will not help them. They will be defeated by their enemies.’
\p
\v 43 “Then I convey the message to you, but you pretend you didn't hear. You defy the Lord's commands, and you arrogantly go to the mountains.
\v 44 Then the Amorites who lived in the mountains came out and attacked you like bees, they chased and killed our army from Seir to Horma.
\v 45 Then you come back and weep before the Lord, but the Lord does not want to hear or pay attention to you.
\v 46 That's why we stayed for a long time in the Village Head-Barnea.”
