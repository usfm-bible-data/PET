\c 25
\s1 Prevention of arbitrary punishment
\p
\v 1 Next Moses taught the people of Israel, “One day something like this might happen: Two Israelites have a disagreement and then take their problem to court, and the judge determines who is guilty between the two.
\v 2 Then if the judge decides that the guilty person should be punished with beatings,\x + \xo 25:2 \xt Deut. 22:18\x* the judge will make him lie face down on the ground so that he can be struck on the back, while the judge is watching. The number of strikes depends on the type of crime he committed,
\v 3 but no more than 40 times because it would result in the guilty person being publicly humiliated."
\s1 Treat animals well
\p
\v 4 "When you use your cow to trample the wheat crop to separate the heads of wheat from the stalks and chaff, don't tie the cow's mouth to prevent it from eating."
\s1 Responsibility to relatives who have died
\p
\v 5 “If there are brothers living together and one of them dies without having a son, then his widow may not marry someone outside the family. One of the brothers of the deceased must marry his widow in order to fulfill his obligations towards his deceased brother.\f + \fr 25:5 \fk marry his widow...his brother. \ft According to custom, this is seen as a family obligation with the aim of giving the widow a child, as the heir of her late husband. If there is no brother who can marry the widow, or if the sibling is not ready to do his duty, then the obligation is transferred to the man who has the closest family relationship, as seen in the book of Ruth.\f*
\v 6 The first son that is born will be counted as a descendant of the deceased, so that the deceased will have an heir among the Israelites.
\p
\v 7 "But if the brother of the deceased does not want to marry the widow, then the widow must report to the assembly of city leaders, 'My late husband's brother refuses his obligation. He doesn't want to marry me to continue the family line for my husband.'
\v 8 Then the leaders of the city must call the man and talk to him. If he continues to insist, 'I don't want to marry my brother's widow,'
\v 9 then the widow should approach him in the presence of the leaders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face, and say, 'This is what is done to the man who does not want to cause an heir to continue on for his late brother.'
\v 10 After that, let the family of the man who refused to fulfill his obligation be called 'The family of the fool whose sandal was removed.' Thus the family will always be considered despicable in the midst of the people."
\s1 Other regulations
\p
\v 11 "If two men fight, and one of their wives comes to help her husband by grabbing his opponent's genitals,
\v 12 then cut off the woman's hand. Don't feel sorry for her.
\p
\v 13-14 “When you trade, don't give yourself an advantage in a fraudulent way, for example falsifying weights.
\v 15 Always use an honest weight and measurement so that you may remain in the land that the LORD God is about to hand over to you.
\v 16 The LORD hates all merchants who deal fraudulently.
\s1 Command to destroy the Amalekites
\p
\v 17 “Always remember what the Amalekites did just after we left Egypt.
\v 18 When we were fatigued and exhausted, they attacked the end of the rearguard and killed everyone who lagged behind the group.\x + \xo 25:18 \xt Ex. 17:8-16\x* They do not fear the LORD.
\v 19 Therefore you must destroy all the Amalekites so that the nation is extinct from the earth. Do this after the LORD God has given you peace from enemy attacks in all the land that the LORD will soon give to you. Don't forget to do this command!"
