\c 25
\s1 Against evil
\p
\v 1 "Suppose two Israelites disagree and bring their problem to court, and the judge declares which of the two of them is wrong.
\v 2 If the judge decided that the person who was wrong must be punished by whipping, then the judge must order him to lie on his stomach on the ground so that his back is whipped before the judge.
\v 3 The whipping punishment can not be more than 40 times because that could result in the other person shaming the person who is wrong in front of the public.
\s1 Don't shut the mouth of your cow
\p
\v 4 "When you have your cow work by trampling the wheat harvested to separate the grains of wheat from the stalk and the chaff, don't tie up the mouth of that cow to prevent it eating."
\s1 Responsibilities toward a brother who dies
\p
\v 5 "If two brothers live together and one of them dies without having sons, then his widow may not marry with a person outside of his family. The brother of the person who died must have sex with his wife to fulfill the obligation as a brother of the husband of that widow.\f + \fr 25:5 \fk custom of giving descendants to a widow \ft The custom of giving descendants was seen as the obligation of family to if possible provide descendants for the deceased one leaving an inheritance. The child that is born will inherit the land that was owned by the husband of his mother who died. If there is no brother that could or was willing to do the obligation, then the obligation moves to a male who has the closest family connection, as is seen in the book of Ruth.\f*
\v 6 The first son from their sexual union will be considered as the child from the person who already died, so that he has descendants among the nation of Israel.
\p
\v 7 "But if that brother doesn't want to have sex with that widow, then that widow must go to the city gate and tell the city elders that, 'The brother of my husband doesn't want to do his obligation. He doesn't want to have sex with me in order to continue my husband's descendants by birthing a son for him, so that my husband's name isn't lost in Israel.'
\v 8 Then the city elders must call that man and speak to him. If he continues to insist and says, 'I don't want to have sex with her,'
\v 9 then that widow must approach him in the presence of the leaders, and take off the man's sandal, spit in his face, and say, 'This is what must be done to the person who doesn't want to give descendants to his brother who has died.'
\v 10 Let that man's family be called, 'The family of the person whose sandal was loosed,' so that they are ashamed in front of the public."
\s1 Other rules
\p
\v 11 "When two men fight, and the wife of one man comes to help her husband by holding the male organ of her husband's opponent,
\v 12 then cut of that woman's hand. Don't have pity on her.
\p
\v 13-14 "When you buy and sell, don't cheat by using two scales whose measurements are different, that weigh more or measure more to buy and weigh less or measure less to sell things.
\v 15 You must use scales and measures that are true, so that you live long in the land that is given by the LORD God to you.
\v 16 The LORD God hates everyone who cheats by doing that thing.
\s1 Command to kill the Amalekites
\p
\v 17 "Continue to remember what the Amalekites did to you all when you all were on your journey out of Egypt.
\v 18 When you all were weak and had no strength, they attacked from the back of your line and killed all of the weak and who couldn't walk quickly. They don't fear the LORD.
\v 19 Because of that, you must anihilate all of the Amalekites so that not one person will remember that nation. Do that when the LORD God will give you calmness from attacks of all the enemies who are around you in the land that He gives to you(pl). Don't forget to do this command!"
