\c 25
\s1 Prevention of arbitrary punishment
\p
\v 1 Next Moses taught the people of Israel, “One day something like this might happen: Two Israelites disagree and then take their problems to court, and the judge determines who is guilty of the two men.
\v 2 Then if the judge decides that the guilty person should be punished with beatings,\x + \xo 25:2 \xt Deut. 22:18\x* the judge will make him lie face down on the ground so that he can strike him on the back, while the judge is watching. The number of hits depends on the type of crime he has committed,
\v 3 but not more than 40 times because it would result in the guilty person being publicly humiliated."
\s1 Treat animals well
\p
\v 4 "When you use your cow to work trampling the wheat crop to separate the heads of wheat from the stalks and chaff, don't tie the cow's mouth to prevent it from eating."
\s1 Responsibility to relatives who died
\p
\v 5 “If there are brothers living together and one of them dies without having a son, then the widow may not marry someone outside the family. One of the brothers of the deceased had to marry his widow in order to fulfill his obligations towards his deceased brother.\f + \fr 25: 5 \fk married his widow ... his brother. \ft According to custom, this is seen as a family obligation with the aim of giving the widow a child, as the heir of her late husband. If there is no brother who can marry the widow, or if the sibling is not willing to do her duty, then the obligation is transferred to the man who has the closest family relationship, as seen in the book of Ruth.\f*
\v 6 The first son who was born would be counted as descendants of the dead person, so that the deceased would have an heir among the Israelites.
\p
\v 7 "But if the brother of the deceased does not want to marry the widow, then the widow must report to the council of city leaders, 'My late husband's brother refuses his obligation. She didn't want to marry me in order to continue the offspring for my husband.'
\v 8 Then the leaders of the city are to call the man and talk to him. If she continues to insist, 'I don't want to marry my brother's widow,'
\v 9 then the widow should approach him in the presence of the leaders, take off one of her footwear, spit in her face, and say, 'This is what is done to the man who does not want to continue an heir for his late brother.'
\v 10 After that, let the family of men who refuse to fulfill their obligations be called 'The family of the fool whose sandals are released.' Thus the family is always considered despicable in society."
\s1 Other regulations
\p
\v 11 "When two men fight, and the wife of one of the people comes to help her husband by grabbing his opponent's genitals,
\v 12 then cut off the woman's hand. Don't feel sorry for her.
\p
\v 13-14 “When you trade, don't profit yourself in a fraudulent way, for example counterfeiting weights.
\v 15 Always use an honest weight and measurement so that you may remain in the land that the LORD God is about to hand over to you.
\v 16 The LORD hates all the merchants who cheat.
\s1 Orders to destroy the Amalekites
\p
\v 17 “Always remember what the Amalekites did when we just got out of Egypt.
\v 18 When we were exhausted and exhausted, they attacked the end of the rearguard and killed everyone who missed the group.\x + \xo 25:18 \xt Ex. 17:8-16\x* They do not fear the LORD.
\v 19 Therefore you must destroy all Amalekites so that they may disappear from the earth. Do this after the LORD Allah has given you peace from the enemy's attacks in all the land that the LORD will soon give to you. Don't forget to do this command!"
