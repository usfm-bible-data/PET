\s Only one place to worship
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, “These are a number of rules and regulations that you must obey carefully while you are living in the land given by the LORD, the God of our ancestors.
\p
\v 2 “Destroy every place of idolatry where the nations you are about to cast out worship their gods, whether on mountains, hills, or under big trees.
\v 3 Tear down their altars, destroy their stone pillars. Burn the wooden pillars that are symbolic of the goddess Asherah. Crush every idol, so that no one will remember or worship those gods again.
\p
\v 4 “Do not worship the LORD by imitating the way the nations worship. They worship gods everywhere.
\v 5 Rather, you must worship the LORD at His tabernacle,\f + \fr 12:5 \fk His tabernacle... \ft Literally, 'the place to make his name dwell there'. The word 'His name' here is a figure of speech (metonymy) that refers to His entire person. Included in this figurative sense is that the place will be the center of the worship of the LORD.\f* which will be established in the place He determines from the territory of one of the tribes of Israel.
\v 6 Only in that place may you offer all burnt offerings, other sacrifices, tithe offerings, various special offerings, offerings to fulfill oaths, voluntary offerings, and sacrifices for the firstborn of your herds of cattle, goats, and sheep.
\v 7 There, before the LORD, you and your family will hold a feast from offering a sacrifice and will be glad, because the LORD has blessed all your efforts.
\p
\v 8 “When you are living in the land of Canaan, do not act as you do here. Now everyone still worships the LORD as he pleases,
\v 9 because you are not yet living peacefully in the final destination, which is the land that the LORD God is giving as your possession from generation to generation.
\v 10 But you will cross the Jordan River soon, and the LORD will help you possess the territory on the other side of the river. After He has given you relief from war, you will live in peace and security,
\v 11 the LORD will choose a place for you to worship Him. At that location you must bring all the kinds of offerings that I have commanded, including tithes, burnt offerings, various other sacrifices, and any other offerings you promise to give to the LORD.
\p
\v 12 “When you have a feast from offering a sacrifice, do it before the LORD at his tabernacle, along with your wife, your children, your male and female servants. Also invite the Levites who live in your cities, because they will not receive a portion of land like you will receive.
\v 13 Remember so that you do not offer burnt offerings just anywhere.
\v 14 Offer sacrifices only at the tabernacle of the LORD, at the location He will determine in the territory of a tribe of Israel. It is there that you must perform all the rituals of worship according to the command of the LORD that I am telling you.
\p
\v 15 “However, you are free to slaughter and eat the meat of your livestock at each of your residences, as much as you like, according to the blessing that the LORD your God has given. Eating the meat is the same as eating deer or gazelle meat. Everyone can eat it, whether he is unclean or not.
\v 16 But do not eat the blood. Drain the blood of the slaughtered beast onto the ground like water.
\p
\v 17 "At your place of residence, do not eat the various kinds of tithes that should be given to the LORD, such as the tithe of wheat, freshly pressed wine, or olive oil. Besides that, the firstborn of your cows and sheep should not be eaten, because they must be presented to the LORD. Likewise, voluntary offerings, various special offerings, and offerings to fulfill your oath to the LORD should not be eaten just anywhere.
\v 18 Rather, you and your children, male and female slaves, as well as the descendants of the tribe of Levi who live in your city must eat the appointed portion of these offerings before the LORD, at His tabernacle, in the place He chooses. In that day you will be joyful before the LORD your God, because of the abundance of all your efforts.
\v 19 As long as you live in the land, make sure that the descendants of the tribe of Levi participate in the feast of your sacrifice.
\p
\v 20-21 "After the LORD your God has expanded your territory as He promised, so that the city He chooses as the location of His tabernacle is too far from your house, then when you want to eat meat, you can slaughter your livestock and eat it in your respective cities. So, like I have already commanded, you can eat meat to your heart's content.
\v 22 People who are clean or unclean may eat the meat, like you eat deer and gazelle meat now.
\v 23-24 But the blood must not be eaten with it, for blood is a symbol of life that the LORD has given to every living thing.\x + \xo 12:23 \xt Gen. 9:4; Lev. 17:10-14\x* To honor the life that the LORD has given to every living creature, you must drain the blood of animals or birds onto the ground like water before you eat their flesh.
\v 25 If you obey this commandment, then both you and your descendants will always live in prosperity, because you have done what is right in the sight of the LORD.
\p
\v 26 "But all the things that you have set apart to present to the LORD, including the offering to fulfill your oath, take them to His tabernacle.
\v 27 All burnt offerings are to be offered on the altar of the LORD your God, both flesh and blood. The blood of the sacrifice must be poured out by the side of the altar of the LORD, but there are several types of sacrifices whose meat may be eaten.
\v 28 Carefully obey all the commandments that I teach you, so that you and your descendants may always live in prosperity. It can only happen if you do good things and live righteously in the sight of the LORD your God.”
\s Prohibition to follow the customs of other nations
\p
\v 29 "When you enter the land that you will possess and advance in attacking every region, the LORD our God will drive out and destroy the people who live there.
\v 30 After that, be careful! Do not imitate their customs and worship their gods, for doing so is sure to bring disaster upon you. Do not ask anyone for instructions saying, 'Tell us how the previous inhabitants worshiped their gods, so that we too may worship those gods.'
\v 31 Do not worship the LORD your God by imitating the way other nations worship their gods, for in worshipping gods, they do something that the LORD really hates, namely burning their own children on the altar as sacrifices to gods.
\p
\v 32 “Thoroughly do all that I command. Don't add anything or take anything away from it."
