\c 12
\s Only one place to worship
\p
\v 1 “These are the statutes and rules that you must obey carefully thought out as long as you live in the land given by the LORD, God of our ancestors.
\p
\v 2 “Destroy every place of idol worship where the nations that you will drive out worship their false gods— whether on top of a mountain, a hill, or under shady trees.
\v 3 Tear down their altars, destroy their idol monuments made of stone so that nothing is left. Burn the pillars of the Asherah goddess. Destroy every idols they made from wood, so that not even one person will remember or worship those false gods again.
\p
\v 4 “Do not worship the LORD your God by imitating the way those nations worship their gods.
\v 5 Instead, you must go to the place which the LORD has chosen. That place will be located in the territory of one of the tribes of Israel. In that place you must come and worship Him.
\v 6 There you must sacrifice all of your burnt offerings, other animal sacrifices, tithe offerings, various special offerings, offerings to fulfill vows, voluntary offerings, and firstborn sacrifices from your cows, goats, and sheep herds.
\v 7 It is there, before the LORD your God, that you and your family will eat and rejoice, because all of your efforts are so blessed by the LORD.
\p
\v 8 “When you already live in the land of Canaan, do not do what you are still doing here. Now every one still worships the LORD as they like
\v 9 because you have not yet arrived in the peaceful land that the LORD God will give to you as an inheritance.
\v 10 But you will soon cross the Jordan River and the LORD will help you to occupy and dwell in the land across that Jordan River. He will protect you from all enemies that surround you then you can live in safety.
\v 11 Then the LORD will choose a place where He wants you to worship Him. That is the place where you must bring all that I commanded you to offer— including burnt offerings, various other animal offerings, tithe offerings,
\p
\v 12 “At that time rejoice before the LORD your God, with your wife, your children, your male and female servants, and people from the tribe of Levi who live in your cities. Invite them because they do not receive portions of land like you will receive.
\v 13 Remember that so that you don't offer burnt offerings anywhere that you like.
\v 14 Offer animal sacrifices only in the place chosen by the LORD for you, in the territory of one of the tribes of Israel. And there you must do all that the LORD commands you.
\p
\v 15 “However, you are free to slaughter and eat the meat of the livestock you own wherever you live, according to the blessings of the LORD your God to you. Eating that meat is the same as eating deer or antelope meat. Everyone may eat them— whether they are in an unclean state or not.
\v 16 But you may not eat the blood of any animals. Pour the blood to the ground like water.
\p
\v 17 In your homes, do not eat the various tithes that are supposed to be given to the LORD. So you may not eat the wheat, drink the new wine, or cook using olive oil that you prepare as an offering to the LORD. The firstborn of your cows, goats, and sheep also may not be eaten because they must be offered to the LORD. In the same way the supplies for freewill offerings, various special offerings, and offerings to fulfill a vow to the LORD must not be eaten.
\v 18 Instead, you— along with your children, male and female slaves, and also the descendants from the tribe of Levi that live in your cities— must eat those offerings before the LORD, in the place that He chooses. Rejoice before the LORD your God because of the abundant produce of your labor.
\v 19 Ensure that you fulfill the daily needs of the descendants of the tribe of Levi as long as you live in your land.
\p
\v 20 “When the LORD your God expands your territory as He promised, then you may eat meat whenever you want.
\v 21 If the place the the LORD your God chooses as the place to worship Him is too far from your home, then you may slaughter your livestock that the LORD has given to you, and eat it in your cities anytime you want.
\v 22 Both people in a clean state or unclean state may eat that meat, as how you are now eating deer and antelope meat.
\v 23 But you may not drink the blood or eat food that contains blood, because blood always signifies that the LORD is the One who gives life to each of those animals.\x + \xo 12:23 \xt Gen. 9:4; Lev. 17:10-14\x* For that reason do not eat meat that still contains blood.
\v 24 You may not eat them. You must let the blood of that animal flow to the ground like water.
\v 25 If you obey these commands, then you or your descendants will always live prosperously, because of doing what is right in the LORD's sight.
\p
\v 26 “But bring everything that you set apart to offer to the LORD to the place that the LORD will choose, including all offerings to fulfill your vows.
\v 27 All your burnt sacrifices must be offered on the altar of the LORD your God— both the meat and the blood. The blood of the sacrifices must be poured out on the sides of the LORD’s altar, but there are a some types of sacrifice where the meat may be eaten.
\v 28 Obey carefully all the commands that I teach you, so that you and your descendants will always live prosperously. That will only happen if you do the things that are good and live righteously in the sight of the LORD your God.”
\s Prohibitions to follow the cultures of other nations
\p
\v 29 “When you enter the land that you will conquer, when you move forward to attack each area, the LORD our God will drive out and destroy the nation that lives there.
\v 30 After that, be careful! Do not imitate their cultures and worship their gods, because those acts will surely bring disaster on you. Do not ask for directions of anyone by saying, ‘Tell us how the residents who used to live here worshiped their gods, so that we can also worship those gods.’
\v 31 Do not worship the LORD your God by imitating the way other nations worship their gods. Because in worshiping their gods, they do things that the LORD really hates— that is burning their own children on the altar as a sacrifice for their gods.
\p
\v 32 “Everything that I have commanded you, do it carefully! Do not add anything to it or substract anything from it.”
