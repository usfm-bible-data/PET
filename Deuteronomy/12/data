\s Only one place to worship
\p
\v 1 “These are the statutes and rules that you must obey carefully as long as you live in the land that the LORD, God of our ancestors gave.
\p
\v 2 “Destroy every site of idol worship where the nations that you will drive out worshipped their fake gods— whether on top of a mountain, hill, or under shady trees.
\v 3 Tear down their altars, destroy their idol monuments made of stone so that nothing is left. Burn the pillars of the Asherah goddess. Destroy every idols they made from wood, so that not even one person will remember or worship those false gods again.
\p
\v 4 “Do not worship the LORD your God by imitating the way those nations wosrhip their gods.
\v 5 Instead, you must go to the place that the LORD has chosen. That place will be located in the territory of one of the tribes of Israel. In that place you must come and worship Him.
\v 6 There you must sacrifice all your burnt offerings, other animal sacrifices, tithe offerings, various special offerings, offerings to fulfill vows, voluntary offerings, and firstborn sacrifice from your cow, goat, and sheep herds.
\v 7 It is there, before the LORD your God, where you aand your family will eat and rejoice, because all your efforts are so blessed by the LORD.
\p
\v 8 “When you have lived in the land of Canaan, do not do like what you are still doing here. Now every one sitll worshp the LORD as they like
\v 9 because you have not yet arrived in the serene land that the LORD God will give to you as an inheritance.
\v 10 But you will soon cross the Jordan River and the LORD will help you to occupy and dwell in the land across that Jordan River. He will protect you from all enemies that surround you then you can live safely.
\v 11 Then the LORD will choose a place where He wants you to worship Him. That is the place where you must bring all that I commanded for you to offer— including burnt offerings, various other animal offerings, tithe,
\p
\v 12 “At that time rejoice before the LORD your God, with your wife, your children, your male and female servants, and people from the tribe of Levi that live in your cities. Invite them because they do not receive portions of land like what you will receive.
\v 13 Remember that you do not offer burnt offerings in just anywhere you like.
\v 14 Offer animal sacrifices only in the place that the LORD has chosen for you, in the territory of one of the tribes of Israel. And there you have to do all that the LORD commands you.
\p
\v 15 “However, you are free to slaughter and eat the meat of your livestock wherever you live, according to the blessings of the LORD your God to you. Eating that meat is the same as eating deer or muntjac meat. Everyone may eat them— whether they are in an unclean state or not.
\v 16 But you may not eat the blood of any animals. Pour the blood to the ground like water.
\p
\v 17 In your homes, do not eat the various tithes that are supposed to be given to the LORD. So you may not eat the wheat, drink the new wine, or cook using olive oil that you prepare as an offering to the LORD. The firstborn of your cows, goats, and sheeps also may not be eaten because they must be offered to the LORD. Also various stocks for freewill offering, various special offering, and offering to fulfill vow to the LORD may not be eaten.
\v 18 Instead, you— along with your children, male and female slaves, and also the descendants from the tribe of Levi that lives in your cities— must eat those offerings before the LORD, in the place that He chose. Rejoice before the LORD your God because of the abundance from your work.
\v 19 Ensure that you fulfill the daily needs of the descendants of the tribe of Levi as long as you live in your land.
\p
\v 20 “When the LORD your God extends your territory as He promised, then you may eat meat whenever you want.
\v 21 If the place the the LORD your God chose as the place to worship Him is too far from your home, then you may slaughter your livestock that the LORD has given to you, and eat it in your cities anytime you want.
\v 22 Whether people in a clean state or unclean state may eat that meat, as how you are now eating deer and muntjac meat.
\v 23 But you may not drink the blood or eat food that contain blood, because blood alwys signifies that the LORD is the One who gives life to each of those animals.\x + \xo 12:23 \xt Gen. 9:4; Lev. 17:10-14\x*So, do not eat the meat that still contains blood.
\v 24 You may not eat them. You must let the blood of that animal flow to the water like water.
\v 25 If you obey that command, then you or your descendants will continue to live prosperously, because of doing the right action in the sight of the LORD.
\p
\v 26 “But bring all that you set apart to offer to the LORD to the place that the LORD will choose, including all offerings to fulfill your vow.
\v 27 All your burnt sacrifice must be offered in the altar of the LORD your God— whether the meat or the blood. The blood of the sacrifice must be spilled on the sides of the LORD’s altar, but there are a few types of sacrifice where the meat may be eaten.
\v 28 Obey carefully all the commands that I teach you, that you or your descendants will always live prosperously. That will only happen if you do things that are good and live righteously in the sight of the LORD your God.”
\s Prohibitions to follow the cultures of other nations
\p
\v 29 “When you enter the land that you will conquer, when you move forward to attack every area, the LORD our God will drive away and destroy the nation that lives there.
\v 30 After that, be careful! Do not imitate their cultures and worship their gods, because those acts will surely bring disaster on you. Do not ask for direction to ayone by saying, ‘Let us know how people who previously lived here worshipped their gods, so that we can also worship those gods.’
\v 31 Do not worship the LORD your God by imitating how other nations worshipped their gods. Because in worshipping their gods, they did things that the LORD really hates— that is to burn their own children on the altar as a sacrifice for their gods.
\p
\v 32 “Everything that I commanded you, do them carefully! Do not add something to it or substract something from it.”
