\v 1 “These are the statutes and rules that you must obey carefully as long as you live in the land that the LORD, God of our ancestors gave.
\p
\v 2 “Destroy every site of idol worship where the nations that you will drive out worshipped their fake gods— whether on top of a mountain, hill, or under shady trees.
\v 3 Tear down their altars, destroy their idol monuments made of stone so that nothing is left. Burn the pillars of the Asherah goddess. Destroy every idols they made from wood, so that not even one person will remember or worship those false gods again.
\p
\v 4 “Do not worship the LORD your God by imitating the way those nations wosrhip their gods.
\v 5 Instead, you must go to the place that the LORD has chosen. That place will be located in the territory of one of the tribes of Israel. In that place you must come and worship Him.
\v 6 There you must sacrifice all your burnt offerings, other animal sacrifices, tithe offerings, various special offerings, offerings to fulfill vows, voluntary offerings, and firstborn sacrifice from your cow, goat, and sheep herds.
\v 7 It is there, before the LORD your God, where you aand your family will eat and rejoice, because all your efforts are so blessed by the LORD.
\p
\v 8 “When you have lived in the land of Canaan, do not do like what you are still doing here. Now every one sitll worshp the LORD as they like
\v 9 because you have not yet arrived in the serene land that the LORD God will give to you as an inheritance.
\v 10 But you will soon cross the Jordan River and the LORD will help you to occupy and dwell in the land across that Jordan River. He will protect you from all enemies that surround you then you can live safely.
\v 11 Then the LORD will choose a place where He wants you to worship Him. That is the place where you must bring all that I commanded for you to offer— including burnt offerings, various other animal offerings, tithe,
\p
\v 12 “At that time rejoice before the LORD your God, with your wife, your children, your male and female servants, and people from the tribe of Levi that live in your cities. Invite them because they do not receive portions of land like what you will receive.
\v 13 Remember that you do not offer burnt offerings in just anywhere you like.
\v 14 Offer animal sacrifices only in the place that the LORD has chosen for you, in the territory of one of the tribes of Israel. And there you have to do all that the LORD commands you.
\p
\v 15 “However, you are free to slaughter and eat the meat of your livestock wherever you live, according to the blessings of the LORD your God to you. Eating that meat is the same as eating deer or muntjac meat. Everyone may eat them— whether they are in an unclean state or not.
\v 16 But you may not eat the blood of any animals. Pour the blood to the ground like water.
