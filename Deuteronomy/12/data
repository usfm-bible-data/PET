\v 2 “Destroy every site of idol worship where the nations that you will drive out worshipped their fake gods— whether on top of a mountain, hill, or under shady trees.
\v 3 Tear down their altars, destroy their idol monuments made of stone so that nothing is left. Burn the pillars of the Asherah goddess. Destroy every idols they made from wood, so that not even one person will remember or worship those false gods again.
\p
\v 4 “Do not worship the LORD your God by imitating the way those nations wosrhip their gods.
\v 5 Instead, you must go to the place that the LORD has chosen. That place will be located in the territory of one of the tribes of Israel. In that place you must come and worship Him.
\v 6 There you must sacrifice all your burnt offerings, other animal sacrifices, tithe offerings, various special offerings, offerings to fulfill vows, voluntary offerings, and firstborn sacrifice from your cow, goat, and sheep herds.
