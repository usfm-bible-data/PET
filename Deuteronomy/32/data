\q1
\v 1 Hear the truth that I will convey.
\q2 Hear, o' all that is in every level of heaven, sky, and earth!\x + \xo 32:1 \xt Gen. 1:1\x*
\q1
\v 2 May my teaching come down like raindrops
\q2 And my words like dew on the ground,
\q1 like a drizzle watering young leaf buds,
\q2 and as dew wets the grass.
\q1
\v 3 Praise the LORD!
\q1 I cry out praise to the LORD!
\q2 How great He is!
\q1
\v 4 He is like a rock in which we take refuge.
\q2 Everything He does is perfect and absolutely fair.
\q1 He always keeps His promises and never makes mistakes.
\q2 He really is fair and honest.
\b
\q1
\v 5 But you, O Israelites, have not been faithful to him.
\q2 Because of your sins, you are no longer worthy to be called His children.
\q2 You are a wicked nation and liars!
\q1
\v 6 Is that how you repay all the goodness of the LORD to us?!
\q2 Why are you so slow to learn?!
\q1 Is He not our Father, who created us,
\q2 who raised us to become one nation?!
\b
\q1
\v 7 Remember what happened in the past!
\q2 Reflect on the experiences of your ancestors!
\q1 Ask your parents and elders,
\q2 and they'll tell you about our history.
\q1
\v 8 Formerly the LORD Most High divided mankind into nations,
\q2 and determined where each nation would live from generation to generation,
\q2 including the borders of the descendants of Israel.\f + \fr 32:8 \fk descendants of Israel \ft Which is translated by TSI as 'the descendants of Israel', in the Masoretic text is called 'the children of Israel', in the Septuagint is called 'angels', whereas in the text of the Dead Sea Scrolls is called 'children of God'.\f*
\q1
\v 9 But the LORD made us, the descendants of Jacob, to be his special people.
\b
\q1
\v 10 The LORD found our ancestors in a barren and desolate wilderness.
\q2 Then He protected and looked after them.
\q2 He looked after them like someone protects his own eyes.
\q1
\v 11 The LORD cares for his people like an eagle that cares for its young.
\q2 When a young eagle is just learning to fly, the mother is always ready to catch her young with her spread wings.
\q1
\v 12 O people of Israel, it is only the LORD Himself who leads us.
\q2 Not a single god has ever helped us.
\b
\q1
\v 13 I see that a victory from the LORD will bring you to possess all the hilly regions of the land of Canaan.
\q2 You will be satisfied with the crops of the fields. The land that the LORD is giving you is so fertile, that in rocky places honeycombs can be found,
\q2 and olive trees thrive even on rocky ground.\f + \fr 32:13 \fk Explanation of time in prophecy \ft In the Hebrew text, starting in this verse Moses tells of things that haven't happened yet as if they had already happened. Or it can be said that the LORD showed Moses what had not yet happened, and Moses shared what he had seen. So past time adverbs are used to prophesy things that haven't happened yet. This is a characteristic of prophecy often seen in the Bible. That is why the TSI translates the word "already" as "will" in this chapter. Also in the poetry of this chapter, the Hebrew text often refers to the Israelites as 'they', and the TSI translates according to the meaning, which is 'you all'.\f*
\q1
\v 14 You will enjoy an abundance of milk from your cows and goats
\q2 and the most delicious and tender meats from your lambs, cows and goats.
\q1 You will be blessed with very fine grain crop
\q2 and with wine squeezed from the finest grapes.
\b
\q1
\v 15 But I also see that someday you, my beloved people,\f + \fr 32:15 \fk my beloved people \ft Literally in the Hebrew text, Moses called Israel a familiar nickname, namely Yeshurun, which means 'righteous people'. This name is also found in Deut. 33:5,26; Isa. 44:2.\f* will enjoy prosperity so long that you will grow fat and increasingly rebel against the LORD.
\q1 You will leave God who created you,
\q2 who saved us with His great power.
\q1
\v 16 Like a wife who is unfaithful to her husband, you will prostitute yourselves to the gods and make the LORD jealous.
\q2 You will provoke him by worshiping idols.
\q1
\v 17 You do not continue to offer sacrifices to God, but instead offer sacrifices to evil spirits,
\q2 namely the gods you did not know before and who were never worshiped by our ancestors.
\q1
\v 18 You will forget God our Rock of Protection,
\q2 who is the Creator and source of our life.
\b
\q1
\v 19 At that time the LORD will surely know that you have abandoned him,
\q2 and He will feel disgusted, angry, and reject you as His children.
\q2
\v 20 The LORD will say, “I will no longer help you.
\q2 Let you see what will happen to you!
\q2 You are a very wicked and utterly disloyal people.
\q2
\v 21 You have made me jealous by worshiping gods,
\q2 and provoked my anger by worshiping idols.
\q2 Therefore I will make you jealous and angry with a foolish nation, which really does not deserve to be called a nation.\x + \xo 32:21 \xt Hos. 1:9; 2:23; Rom. 10:19\x*
\q2
\v 22 My anger will be like a fire that burns all the produce of the fields and other plants on the earth.
\q2 The fire of my wrath will scorch the earth to the foundation of the mountains,
\q2 even to the lowest level in Sheol.\x + \xo 32:22 \xt Gen. 37:35\x*
\q1
\v 23 I will bring many calamities upon you.
\q2 As an archer shoots at his enemies, so I will shoot down each one of you with all kinds of calamities.
\q2
\v 24 Hunger will torment you.
\q2 Fever and terrible disease will come upon you.
\q2 I will send wild beasts to pounce on you,
\q2 and a poisonous snake bite to kill you.
\q2
\v 25 When you leave the house, enemies will kill you with their swords.
\q2 And if you take refuge in the house, you will still die of fear.
\q2 Enemy forces will destroy everything, both young people, babies, and the elderly."
\b
\q1
\v 26 The LORD our God says, “I could destroy the nation of Israel
\q2 until it is completely extinct from the face of the earth.
\q2
\v 27 But if I do that, the enemy forces that I send to punish Israel will misinterpret their victory.
\q2 They could think, 'We defeated the Israelites in our own strength!'
\q2 Even though I am the one who strengthened them to punish My people."
\b
\q1
\v 28 Israelites, this is what the LORD says about you!
\q2 You are a people who have no sense
\q2 and are not at all wise.
\q1
\v 29 If only you were wise, you would understand why you were being punished
\q2 and realize what would happen to you if you leave the LORD.
\q1
\v 30 How could a thousand Israelite soldiers run away in fear from just one enemy soldier,
\q2 and ten thousand of your soldiers flee from two enemy soldiers,
\q1 if it weren't for the LORD Israel's Rock of Protection who handed you over to them and left you?!
\q1
\v 31 The gods of the nations who are hostile to Israel are not as strong as the LORD our Rock of Protection!
\q2 Even they themselves admit it!
\q1
\v 32-33 The Gentiles are very wicked, like the ancient humans whom the LORD destroyed in Sodom and Gomorrah.\x + \xo 32:32 \xt Gen. 18:20-21; 19:4-11\x*
\q2 Their produce is like bitter and poisonous forest grapes.
\q2 Their words are like the poison of a viper.
\b
\q1
\v 34 The LORD says, “I have a plan against the Israelites and the nations that are hostile to them.
\q2 The plan I kept well, like someone locked the chest.
\q1
\v 35 It is I who have the right to repay evil and punish them,
\q2 and I'll do it! \x + \xo 32:35 \xt Rom. 12:19\x*
\q2 The time will come when every evil person falls and slips.
\q2 Suddenly, calamity befalls the wicked until they perish."
\b
\q1
\v 36 But when only a few were left of the people of the LORD our God,
\q2 and it's only a number of slaves and the poor,
\q2 when the Israelites were utterly defenseless, Then the LORD will defend them and have mercy on them.
\q1
\v 37 Then He will ask His people, “Where are the gods that you rely on to protect you?
\q2
\v 38 Have you not offered sacrificial fat and wine to them?
\q2 Let those who rise up and help you!
\q1
\v 39 Now, realize that I am the only God.
\q2 There is no one but me.
\q1 I am the one who has the power to kill and revive.
\q1 I am the one who has the right to injure and heal,
\q2 and nothing can prevent me.
\q1
\v 40 By myself, who lives forever, I raise my hand and swear,
\q2
\v 41 I will sharpen my sword
\q2 and handed down a fair sentence.
\q1 I will repay the evil that My enemies have done,
\q2 and repay those who hate me.
\q2
\v 42 Like a hero slaying the enemy army with arrows and swords until the blood is stained everywhere,
\q2 thus I will kill all the troops I take captive and cut off the heads of their commanders."\f + \fr 32:42 \fk the heads of commanders \ft These words can also be translated, 'heads of warriors with long hair.' Based on the translation, it is interpreted that the soldiers of other nations left their hair long as a sign that they had sworn to their gods.\f*
\b
\q1
\v 43 All nations, sing with joy with the LORD's people,
\q2 because the God of Israel will kill his enemies, to avenge the shed blood of his people.
\q1 He has determined the means to punish His enemies
\q2 and make peace with his people and cleanse the impurity from their land."
\b

\v 44-45 Then Moses and Joshua taught the whole song to the people of Israel. When finished,
\v 46 Musa said, "Always remember all the warnings I have given today, and instruct your children to obey carefully everything that is written in this book of the law.
\v 47 All these teachings are not just ordinary words! Your life depends on it! If you obey it, you will still live in the land that you will soon rule on the other side of the Jordan River."
\s1 Moses will die on Mount Nebo
\p
\v 48 On the same day, the LORD said to Moses,
\v 49 “Go up to Mount Nebo in the Mountains of Abarim, in the region of Moab, opposite the city of Jericho, and look over at Canaan, the land I will give to the Israelites.
\v 50-52 You may see the land from a distance, and then you will die on the mountain and be placed with your fathers in death, just as Aaron died on Mount Hor. Like him, neither will you enter the land of Canaan, because you two disobeyed Me before the people of Israel, while you were at the fountain of Meribah, near the city of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You do not respect My holiness among the Israelites.”\x + \xo 32:51 \xt Num. 20:2-13\x*
