\s1 Moses' song
\q1
\v 1 "Listen, all that is in the sky, and I will speak.
\q2 Listen, all that is on the earth, to my words.
\q1
\v 2 Let my lesson fall like drops of rain
\q2 and my words like dew on the ground,
\q1 like rain drops on shoots of young leaves,
\q2 and like heavy rain watering the grass. 
\q1
\v 3 I will praise the LORD.
\q2 Come let us all cry out how awesome is our God.
\q1
\v 4 He is like a mountain of rock where we shelter,
\q2 everything He does is perfect and truly just.
\q1 He is always faithful to fulfill His promises and has never done wrong.
\q2 He is truly just and honest.
\b
\q1
\v 5 "But the Israelites weren't faithful to Him,
\q2 because of their sins, then they weren't worthy any longer to be called His children.
\q2 They were a generation that was very evil and full of deceit.
\q1
\v 6 Is this how you repay all that the LORD has done for you,
\q2 Oh stupid people that don't have wisdom?
\q1 Isn't He your Father, who created you,
\q2 who made you become a nation?
\b
\q1
\v 7 "Remember what happened in the past,
\q2 meditate on the experiences of your forefathers,
\q1 ask your parents and elders,
\q2 and they will tell you.
\q1
\v 8 Previously when the LORD who is Most High divided humans to become nations,
\q2 And when He determined where each nation would live for generations,
\q2 He set their regional boundaries according to the number of the tribes of Israel. \f + \fr 32:8 \fk number of the tribes of Israel \ft In the Masoritic text called children of Israel, in the LXX called angels, whereas in the Dead Sea Scrolls called children of God.\f*
\q1 
\v 9 But the LORD made us become people of His possession,
\q2 The descendants of Jacob were His own possession.
\b
\q1
\v 10 "He formerly met our forefathers in the wilderness that was dry and lonely.
\q2 He protected and cared for them,
\q2 He guarded them like He guards the pupil of His own eye.
\q1
\v 11 He quarded His people as an eagle teaching its children to fly
\q2 while guarding them from above,
\q2 always ready to catch them on top of its spread wings if they fall.
\q1
\v 12 The LORD Himself alone guided them—
\q2 there was not even one god that helped them.
\b
\q1
\v 13 "After they entered the land that the LORD promised to give to them,
\q1 He gave the right to them to rule all of the hilly area of that land,
\q1 and He satisfied them harvest produce from the fields.
\q2 He supplied them with honey from the rocky hill
\q2 and oil from the olive trees that could grow even when planted on the rocky hill slopes.
\q1
\v 14 Their herds of cows and goats produced much milk,
\q2 their sheep, cows and goats were very high quality,
\q1 their wheat harvest produce was very good,
\b
\q1
\q2 and they drank wine that was made from the best grapes.
\v 15 "But the people of Israel became prosperous and rebelled against God.
\q1 They left the God who created them,
\q2 who saved them with His great power.
\q1
\v 16 They made Him jealous by turning to other worships.
\q2 They provoked His anger by worshiping idols. 
\q1
\v 17 They offered sacrifices not to God, but to evil spirits—
\q2 that is deities that they didn't previously know and were never worshiped by their forefathers. 
\q1
\v 18 They forgot the God who protected them,
\q2 who created them and gave them life.
\b
\q1 
\v 19 "When the LORD saw that they forsook Him, He became angry,
\q2 and rejected them as His children.
\q2
\v 20 He said, "I will not help them any more.
\q2 Even if I just see what happens to them!
\q2 The are a generation that is very evil and not at all faithful.
\q2
\v 21 They have made Me jealous by worshiping other deities, that really just demons,
\q2 and they provoked My anger by their meaningless idols.
\q2 So now, I will make them jealous and angry toward a nation that is ignorant, which really isn't worthy to be called a nation. 
\v 22 My anger will be like a fire which burns to the lowest place of dead people
\q2 and burns the whole earth along with all that grows on it,
\q2 even beneath the mountains.
q1 
\v 23 I will pour out many disasters on them.
\q2 I will use all of My arrows to shoot them.
\q1
\v 24 They will be hungry and fevers and diseases that are disgusting will befall them.
\q1 I will send wild animals to attack them,
\q2 and poisonous snakes will bite them.q1 
\v 25 Outside of the houses enemies will kill them with the sword,
\q2 and in their homes they will die of fright.
\q2 Both young people, babies and people that are old, will be destroyed.
\q1
\v 26 I can just surrender them to lands that are far
\q2 so that there is no one left who will remember them.
\q2
\v 27 But if I do those things, their enemies will boast
\q2 and think, "We defeated them by our own strength,
\q2 not the LORD who did all of this.'"
\b
\q1
\v 28 "Nation of Israel, you are a nation that doesn't have reason.
\q2 You don't possess any wisdom at all.
\q1
\v 29 If only you were wise, you would understand why you will be disciplined,
\q1 and concious about what will happen to you.
\q1
\v 30 How could an enemy possibly make a thousand Israeli soldiers afraid so that they run away?
\q2 And how could two enemies can make 10,000 soldiers of yours run,
\q2 if not because the LORD your own defender surrenders you to enemies and forsakes you? 
\q1
\v 31 Your enemies gods aren't as strong as the LORD our Defender!
\q2 In fact even they acknowledge that!
\q1
\v 32-33 They are very evil, like a vineyard in Sodom and Gomorrah,
\q2 whose fruit is bitter and poisonous,
\q and its wine is like the poison of poisonous snakes.
\b
\q1
\v 34 "The Lord says, 'I have plans for the nation of Israel and their enemies.
\q2 I carefully keep those plans like a person locks a trunk that is valuable.q1 
\v 35 I will pay back and punish them.
\q2 The time will come when they will slip and fall.
\q2 It won't be long and disasters will befall them and they will quickly be destroyed.'
\b
\q1
\v 36 "The LORD will defend His people and have compassion on His servants
\q2 when He sees that they don't have any strength at all,
\q2 and there is no one left, either slave or free man.
\q1
\v 37 Then He will ask His people, 'Where are your gods 
\q2 that you relied on to protect you?
\q2
\v 38 Didn't you offer fat sacrifices and wine to them?
\q1 Let them arise and help you!
\q2 Let them protect you!
\b
\q1
\v 39 'Now, be aware that only I am the only God,
\q2 there is no other God but Me.
\q1 I am the one who can kill and make live,
\q2 wound and heal,
\q2 and nothing can prevent Me.
\q1
\v 40 By I myself, who lives forever,
\q2 I lift My hand and swear
\q1
\v 41 I will sharpen My sword,
\q2 and be ready to punish.
\q1 I will pay back My enemies,
\q2 and repay the deeds of people who hate Me.q2 
\v 42 My arrows will be splattered with blood, and My sword will devour souls.
\q1 I will kill every one whom I capture
\q2 and chop off the heads of their commanders.’\f + \fr 32:42 \fk their commanders \ft Or "all of their fighters who have long hair" who let their hair grow long as a sign that they have sworn to their gods.\f* 
\v 43 "Hey all of you nations, shout together with My people,
\q2 because He pays back people who kill His servants.
\q1 He will pay back His enemies
\q1 and redeem the land of His people
\q2 that has become unclean because of their sins."
\b
\p
\v 44 Moses and Joshua expressed that song, while the nation of Israel listened. 
\v 45 When they were done expressing that song,
\v 46 Moses said, "Always remember all that I've warned you today and teach these laws to your children so that they truly obey them. 
\v 47 These commands aren't just ordinary words— your lives depend on them! If you obey them, your lives will be long in the land that you will enter and rule after crossing the Jordan River."
\s1 Moses dies on Mount Nebo
\p
\v 48 That same day, the LORD said to Moses, 
\v 49 "Cimb up Mount Nebo in the Abarim Mountains, in the district of Moab, across from Jericho, and view in the direction of Canaan, the land that I will give to the nation of Israel.
\v 50 You will die on that mountain, like your brother, Aaron, died on Mount Hor
\v 51 because you two betrayed Me in the midst of the Israelites, at the spring of Meribah, the City of Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin. There you didn't honor My holiness in the midst of the nation of Israel. 
\v 52 You will see the land that I will give to the Israelites from afar, but you won't enter into it."
