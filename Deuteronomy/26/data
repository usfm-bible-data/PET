\s1 Harvest offerings
\p
\v 1 "After you have entered the land that the LORD God is giving, and control it, as well as living there,
\v 2 you each must take some of every first harvest in the land that the LORD God gives to you, place it in a basket, and bring it to the place that the LORD will choose as the place to worship Him.
\v 3 Go to the priest who is on duty at that time and say to him, 'With this offering, I declare to the LORD God, that I have entered the land that He promised to our forefathers to give to us.
\v 4 [That/0] priest must take that basket from your hand and place it before the altar of burnt sacrifice of the LORD God.
\v 5 Then you must declare before God, 'Yes, LORD, our forefather, Jacob was a shepherd from Aram. He along with his family went to Egypt and remained there as foreigners. Their number was small when they went to Egypt, but there they became a nation that was great, strong, and many in number.
\v 6 When the Egyptians oppressed and enslaved them harshly,
\v 7 they cried to You, yes, LORD God. You heard their cry and saw how they suffered, working hard, and oppressed.
\v 8 So with Your great strenghten and power, You did wonders so that the Egyptians were very afraid, and brought our forefathers out of Egypt.
\v 9 Then You brought us to this land and gave this very fertile land to us.
\v 10 So now, yes LORD, I bring the first of the harvest that You give to me.' Then place that basket before the LORD God and kneel to worship Him there.
\v 11 Then celebrate by eating together with joy at everything that the LORD God gives to you and your family. Invite also the people from the tribe of Levi and foreigners who live among you."
\v 12 "Every third year is a tithe year. In that year, give ten percent from the produce of your harvest to the Levites, the foreigners, the orphans, and widows in your cities so that their food is enough.
\v 13 Then say before the LORD God, 'Yes LORD, I have taken the part that is holy from my houseâ€” ten percent of my harvest this year, and surrendered it to the Levites, the immigrants, the orphans, and the widows, according to Your to me. I didn't transgress and didn't forget even one of Your commands.
\v 14 I didn't eat the tithe offering when mourning, or even touch it when I was unclean, or offer it to dead people. I have obeyed You, LORD my God, and done all of that according to Your command to me.
\v 15 Look down from Your place in heaven, and bless Your people, the Israelites. Bless also this land, that You promised to our forefathers to give to us, a land that is feritle with nature's produce.'"
\s1 The LORD's chosen people
\v 16 "Today the LORD God commands you to obey all of these rules and statutes. For that reason do everything faithfully, with all your heart and soul.
\v 17 Today you have declared that the LORD is your God. You have promised to live according to His way and be obedient to all of His statutes, commands and rules.
\v 18 And today the LORD has declared that you are His special chosen people, according to His promise to you, and that you must obey all of His commands.
\v 19 If you obey, He will make your nation become most praised and respected above all other nations that He established. You will become a holy people for the LORD God, according to His promise."
