\s1 Harvest offerings
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the people of Israel, "After you have occupied the land that the LORD God gave as your own from generation to generation,
\v 2 Every year each of you shall take a portion of every kind of the first crop of the land, put it in baskets, and bring it to the tabernacle of the LORD in the place which He will determine.
\v 3 Say to the priest who was on duty at that time, 'With this offering, I declare to the LORD God that I have entered the land that He promised our fathers to give to us.'
\v 4-10 Then you must declare, 'O LORD, my ancestors Jacob was a traveler from the land of Syria. He and his family went to Egypt and settled there as immigrants. They were few in number when they went to Egypt, but there they became a great, strong, and many people. When the Egyptians oppressed and forced the descendants of Jacob to become slaves until they were afflicted, they cried out to You, O LORD God. You also heard their cries and saw how they suffered, worked hard, and were oppressed. So with Your might and mighty power, You did miracles so that the Egyptians were very afraid, and You brought us Your people out of Egypt. Then you took us to this land and gave us this very fertile land. So now, O LORD, I am bringing the first crop that You gave me.' Then the priest will take the basket from your hand and place it in front of the altar of the LORD's burnt offering. Leave the basket before the LORD God and worship Him there.
\v 11 Then give a banquet to rejoice in all the blessings that the LORD God has given you and your family. Also invite the immigrants and the Levites who live in your city."
\s1 Tithe
\p
\v 12 “Give one-tenth of your crop each year to the LORD. But every third year,\f + \fr 26:12 \fk third year \ft See footnote to Deut. 14:28\f* you will gather tithes in your respective cities, for the Levites, the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, so that they may have enough food.
\v 13 Then that year, when the LORD comes to the tabernacle, pray, 'O LORD my God, according to Your command I have given all the tithe which I have dedicated to You to the Levites, the aliens, the orphans, and the widow. There is no left tithe that I hold in my house. I have not broken and I have not forgotten a single commandment.
\v 14 I do not eat of the tithe in mourning. I don't touch it when it's unclean. And I don't dedicate part of it to the spirits of the dead. I have obeyed You, O LORD, and have done these things according to Your commandments to me.
\v 15 Behold from Your abode in the highest heavenly level and bless Your people, the nation of Israel. Bless also this rich and fertile land, which you gave us according to your covenant with our ancestors.’"
\s1 The people of the LORD
\p
\v 16 Then Moses said to the people of Israel, "The commandment of the LORD God to you today is to obey all these rules and regulations that I teach. Do it all with all your heart and all your breath.
\v 17-18 Today each of you declares that the LORD is your God. You promise to live according to His will and obey all His statutes, commandments, and regulations. And based on your promise, the LORD also confirmed that you are all his special people, according to his promise to us.
\v 19 In this way He will make our nation the most praiseworthy and honorable above all other nations which He has founded. And according to His promise, the LORD your God will set you apart as a people sanctified by Him."
