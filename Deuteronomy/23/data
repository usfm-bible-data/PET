\c 23
\s1 People who cannot be accepted as the LORD’s people
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the Israelites, "Every man whose testicles are damaged or whose genitals have been cut off may not attend the important gatherings of the LORD's people.\f + \fr 23:1 \fk the important gatherings of the LORD's people \ft There are at least three kinds of gatherings meant here: All adult males within the people of Israel were obliged to attend important feasts held at the tabernacle of the LORD, were permitted to attend the assembly of the people (such as Judges 20: 1-2), and join the Israelite army at time of war. Men with disabilities were prohibited from attending the gatherings, but were not completely expelled from Israelite society. Compare Lev. 21:16-23.\f*
\p
\v 2 “Everyone born outside of marriage may not attend the important gatherings of the LORD's people, not even their descendants up to the tenth generation may participate.
\p
\v 3 “Neither Ammonites nor Moabites may not attend important gatherings of the LORD's people, not even their descendants up to the tenth generation may participate.
\v 4 They are forbidden because they did not give us food or drink when we traveled from Egypt to Canaan, instead they payed Balaam — the son of Beor from Pethor in Aram-Mesopotamia — to curse us.
\v 5 But because the LORD God loves us, He did not listen to Balaam and instead turned the curse into a blessing for us.
\v 6 Never at any time help those two nations to live in abundance and prosperity.
\p
\v 7 “But do not despise the Edomites, for they are still our brothers, from the descendants of Esau. Also, don't despise the Egyptians, because our ancestors lived in their land as immigrants.
\v 8 The third descendant from Edomites and Egyptians who live among you as immigrants may attend the important gatherings of the LORD's people.”
\s1 Keeping the camp clean
\p
\v 9 “When the army of Israel is fighting the enemy and camps in a certain place, keep the camp clean from everything that is unclean.
\v 10 If someone becomes unclean because of a wet dream at night, he must leave the camp in the morning and stay outside for the whole day.
\v 11 When evening comes, he must wash himself with water. Only after sundown may he return to the camp.
\p
\v 12 “You also must prepare a place to defecate outside the camp.
\v 13 Each of you must carry a small shovel in his kit so that he can dig a hole and defecate in it. When finished, the hole must be filled.
\v 14 Take care that your camp is not tainted with uncleanness, for the LORD God will always be present among you to protect you and to defeat your enemies. So take care that uncleanness is not in your camp, so that the LORD will not leave you.”
\s1 Various other laws
\p
\v 15 "If a slave from another land flees to Israel and asks for protection from his master, do not give him back to his master.
\v 16 Let him remain with the Israelites in whatever city he chooses, and do not oppress him.
\p
\v 17 “Let there be no one from among you Israelites, neither male nor female, who becomes a prostitute at a temple of worship of the gods.
\v 18 And the money earned from a temple prostitute may not be accepted in the tabernacle of the LORD your God as any offering, even if that person wants to fulfill an oath by giving some money. The LORD hates everything that is connected with prostitution very much.
\p
\v 19 “Do not collect interest from a fellow Israelite when you lend him money, food, or anything else.
\v 20 You may charge interest when you lend money to foreigners who live in your area, but do not lend to the Israelites at interest. Obey these rules so that the LORD will bless you in all your efforts in the land that you are about to live in.
\p
\v 21 "When you swear to give something to the LORD, do not delay to fulfill your oath,\x + \xo 23:21 \xt Lev. 7:16-17; Num. 30:2-16\x* because by swearing an oath, the LORD your God considers that offering your obligation. You sin if you don't fulfill it.
\v 22 If you never swear an oath, then you will not sin, because indeed you did not break an oath.
\v 23 However, if you voluntarily swear to do something, then you must do it.
\p
\v 24 “When you are walking through the vineyards of a fellow Israelite, you may pick its fruit and eat as much as you want, but it is forbidden to take it home with your basket.
\v 25 Likewise, when you pass through the wheat fields of fellow Israelites, you may pick the heads of wheat and eat them, but do not cut the wheat stalks with a sickle and bring them home."
