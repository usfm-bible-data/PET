\c 23
\s1 People who cannot be accepted as the LORD’s people
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Moses taught the Israelites, "Every man whose testicles were damaged or his genitals cut off should not attend the important gathering of the LORD's people.\f + \fr 23:1 \fk the important gathering of God's people \ft The three kinds of associations are: All adult males in the people of Israel are obliged to attend important celebrations held at the LORD's tabernacle, may attend the assembly of the people (such as Judges 20: 1-2), and join the Israeli army during the war. Men with disabilities were prohibited from attending the gathering, but were not completely expelled from Israeli society. Compare Lev. 21:16-23.\f*
\p
\v 2 “Everyone born outside of marriage may not attend important gatherings of God's people, not even their descendants up to the tenth generation may not participate.
\p
\v 3 “No people from Ammon or Moab could attend important gatherings of God's people, not even their descendants up to the tenth generation could participate.
\v 4 They were forbidden because they did not feed us and drink while we were traveling from Egypt to Canaan, instead paying Balaam — the son of Beor from Petor in Aram-Mesopotamia — to curse us.
\v 5 But because the LORD God loves us, He did not listen to Balaam and instead turned the curse into a blessing for us.
\v 6 Never at any time help the two nations to live in abundance and prosperity.
\p
\v 7 “But do not despise the Edomites, for they are still our brothers, from the descendants of Esau. Also, don't despise the Egyptians, because our ancestors lived in their land as immigrants.
\v 8 The third descendants of the Edomites and Egyptians who live among you as immigrants may attend the important gathering of the LORD's people.”
\s1 Keeping the camp clean
\p
\v 9 “When the army of Israel is fighting the enemy and is camping in a place, keep the camp clean from everything that is unclean.
\v 10 If someone becomes unclean because of a wet dream at night, he must leave the camp in the morning and stay outside for the day.
\v 11 When evening comes, she must take a shower with water. Only after sundown could he return to the camp.
\p
\v 12 “You also have to prepare a place to defecate outside the camp.
\v 13 Each of you must carry a small shovel in his kit so that he can dig a hole and defecate in it. When finished, the hole must be backfilled.
\v 14 Take care that your camp is not tainted with uncleanness, for the LORD Allah will always be present among you to protect you and to defeat your enemies. So take care that uncleanness is not in your camp, so that the LORD will not leave you.”
\s1 Various other laws
\p
\v 15 "If a slave from another land fled to Israel and asked for protection from his master, do not you give him back to his master.
\v 16 Let him remain with the Israelites in whatever city he chooses, and do not oppress him.
\p
\v 17 “Do not any of you Israelites, be it male or female, become a prostitute in the temple of the gods.
\v 18 And the money earned from a temple prostitute may not be accepted in the tabernacle of the LORD your God as any offering, even if that person wants to fulfill an oath by giving some money. God hates everything that is connected with prostitution.
\p
\v 19 “Do not collect interest from a fellow Israelite when you lend him money, food, or anything else.
\v 20 You may charge interest when you lend money to foreigners who live in your area, but do not lend to the Israelites at interest. Obey these rules so that the LORD will bless you in all your efforts in the land that you are about to live in.
\p
\v 21 "When you swear to give something to the LORD, do not delay fulfilling your oath,\x + \xo 23:21 \xt Lev. 7:16-17; Num. 30:2-16\x* because by swearing an oath, the LORD your God considers it your duty to offer this offering. You sin if you don't fulfill it.
\v 22 If you have never sworn an oath, then you will not sin, because you have not broken an oath.
\v 23 However, if you voluntarily swear to do something, then you must do it.
\p
\v 24 “When you are walking through the vineyards of a fellow Israelite, you may pick its fruit and eat as much as you want, but it is forbidden to take it home with your basket.
\v 25 Likewise, when you pass through the wheat fields of fellow Israelites, you may pick the heads of wheat and eat them, but do not cut the wheat stalks with a sickle and bring them home."
