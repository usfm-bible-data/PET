\c 23
\s1 People who may not be received as people of the LORD
\p
\v 1 "Every person whose testicles are not whole or whose shameful thing (penis) has been cut may not be received as the people of the LORD.
\p
\v 2 Every one who was born outside of marriage may not be received as the people of the LORD and infact his descendants to the tenth generation may not be received as the people of the LORD.
\p
\v 3 "The Ammonites or Moabites may not be received as the people of the LORD and infact their descendants to the tenth generation even, won't be received as the people of the LORD,
\v 4 because they didnt give us food and drink when we were on our journey from Egypt to Canaan, and they even paid Balaam— the child of Beor from Pethor in Aram-Mesopotamia— to curse us.
\v 5 But the LORD God didn't hear Balaam, and He changed that curse to become a blessing because He loved us.
\v 6 As long as you live and even forever, don't help that nation to live prosperously or prosper.
\p
\v 7 "But don't hate the Edomites, because they are your brothers— descendants from Esau, Jacob's brother. And don't hate the Egyptians, because your forefathers had lived in their land as foreigners.
\v 8 The third generation of Edomites and Egyptians that live among you may be received as the LORD's people.
\s1 Guard the cleanliness of your camp
\p
\v 9 "When you war against enemies by camping in a place, don't do deeds that aren't pleasing before the LORD.
\v 10 If there is any among you who becomes unclean because of a wet dream at night, then he must go out of the camp and stay outside on that day.
\v 11 When time nears afternoon he must bathe with water and after the sun sets he may enter back into the camp.
\p
\v 12 "You must prepare a place to defecate outside the camp.
\v 13 Every person among you must bring a little shovel in his equipment in order to dig a hole and defecate there.
\v 14 Guard so that your camp remains holy, because the LORD God is always with you in that camp to protect you and defeat your enemies. Don't do anything that is despicable so that He doesn't stay with you."
\s1 Various other laws
\p
\v 15 "If a slave has run away from his master and asks for protection of you, then don't surrender him back to his master.
\v 16 Allow him to stay with you, in the city that he chooses, and don't oppress him.
\p
\v 17 "Don't let anyone among you the people of Israel— either male or female— become a prostitute in the temple of a god.
\v 18 And the payment from a temple prostitute may not be received in the place of worship of the LORD your God as an offering to fulfill a promise. The LORD really hates temple prostitutes and the money that they earn.
\p
\v 19 "Don't charge interest on fellow Israelites when you loan money or food or anything to them.
\v 20 You are allowed to add on interest when loaning money to a foreigner who lives in your area, but for the Israelites don't loan money with interest—so that the LORD God blesses you in all of your doings in the land that you will occupy.
\p
\v 21 When you vow to offer something to the LORD God, don't delay to quickly fulfill your vow. Because the LORD God will demand your vow, and you will sin if you don't fulfill that vow of yours.
\v 22 But if you didn't vow, you didn't sin.
\v 23 However, if you voluntarily vow to do something, then you must do it.
\p
\v 24 "When you walk through the vineyard of your fellowman, you are allowed to pick grapes and eat as many as you want, but you may not bring them home in your basket.
\v 25 When you pass through the field of wheat of your fellowman, you are allowed to pick heads of wheat and eat them, but you are not allowed to cut the stalks with a sickle and bring them home.
