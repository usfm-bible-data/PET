\s1 Joshua becomes Moses' successor
\p
\v 1 After Moses taught these things to the Israelites,
\v 2 he said to them, "Now I am 120 years old and no longer strong enough to lead you. Besides, the LORD also told me, 'You will not cross the Jordan River.'
\v 3 It is the LORD our God who will cross the river before you. He will destroy the nations that are before you, and you will take their land. As the LORD said, Joshua will lead you across the river.
\v 4 The LORD will destroy the nations of the land just as He destroyed Sihon and Og, kings of the Amorites.
\v 5 The LORD will help you in conquering these nations. And you have to destroy them all, according to the orders I gave to you.
\v 6 You must be strong and courageous. Don't be afraid of them because the LORD our God is with you. He will always help you and will not leave you."
\p
\v 7 So Moses called Joshua and said to him before all the Israelites, “You must be strong and courageous, for you will lead this people to the land that the LORD promised our ancestors to give us. You will lead them to rule the land so that each family owns the land which is an inheritance from generation to generation.
\v 8 The LORD himself will go before you and be with you. He will always help you and will not leave you. Therefore do not be afraid or be discouraged."
\s1 Regulation on the reading of laws
\p
\v 9 Moses wrote down all these laws on long parchment sheets until they became scrolls, and before all the leaders of Israel he handed them over to the priests who led the servants of the tribe of Levi in their task of carrying the covenant chest.\x + \xo 31:9 \xt Deut. 10:8\x*
\v 10 Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seventh year (i.e. the year of debt relief), during the Festival of Leafy Branches,
\v 11 You are to read this book of the law before all the children of Israel who have gathered to worship the LORD our God in his tabernacle.
\v 12 Gather all the people who come from every city, whether men, women, children, or foreigners, that they may learn to fear and honor the LORD and to obey all these laws carefully.
\v 13 This reading is intended so that your descendants who do not know about the law can hear it. They must learn to fear and honor the LORD God while living in the land that you will soon rule across the Jordan River.”
\s1 The Israelites will betray the LORD
\p
\v 14 The LORD said to Moses, “Soon you will die. Therefore, call Joshua and come with him before me in My tabernacle. I want to appoint him as your replacement. " Then Moses and Joshua came to the LORD in His tabernacle
\p
\v 15 and the LORD appeared in the form of a pillar of cloud by the door of the tent.
\v 16 The LORD said to Moses, “You will die soon. After you die, this people will betray me like a wife who goes to prostitution, by worshiping the gods belonging to the nations of the land they are about to enter. They will leave me and break the covenant I made with them.
\v 17 When that happens, I will be very angry with them. I will leave the Israelites and help them no longer, even I will destroy them. So many bad things will happen to them, so they say, 'Surely all these troubles are happening because our Allah is no longer with us.'
\v 18 At that time I will not help them at all, because they have done evil by worshiping the gods.
\p
\v 19 “Now write down the song which I will give to you and teach the Israelites so that they will memorize it. One day the words of this song will prove that they are no longer obedient to Me.
\v 20 I will bring them to a very fertile land, which I promised their ancestors. There they will live in prosperity and eat as much as they can until they become fat. But then they will turn to worship the gods. They will reject Me and break My covenant.
\v 21 Therefore, many calamities will befall them. That's when this song will remind them of My reason to punish them, because they will always sing this song from generation to generation. I know their way of thinking before they even enter the land I promise you."
\p
\v 22 So that very day Moses wrote down the words of this song and taught it to the Israelites.
\p
\v 23 Then the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, “You must be strong and courageous, for you will lead the Israelites into the land that I promised your ancestors to give them. I'll be with you."
\p
\v 24 After Moses finished writing all these laws on a scroll,
\v 25 he gave this command to the servants of the tribe of Levi who were in charge of carrying the chest of the LORD's covenant,
\v 26 “Take this book of the law and put it beside the covenant chest. In the future, that book will become evidence when the Israelites broke the law of God."
\p
\v 27 “I know you are all very stubborn. Even when I was alive with you, you often rebelled against God, especially after I die!
\v 28 So, bring together all your tribal elders and leaders, so that I can speak directly to them. Let heaven and earth bear witness that I have conveyed all these laws of God to you.
\v 29 I say this knowing that after I die, you will do evil by turning away from what I have commanded you. At that time, disaster will come upon you because you made the LORD angry by doing what was evil in His eyes.”
\s1 Moses teaches a song
\p
\v 30 Then Moses delivered this teaching song to all the people of Israel:
