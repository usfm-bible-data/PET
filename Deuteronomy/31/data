\s1 Joshua becomes Moses' successor
\p
\v 1 After Moses delivered all of that to the Israelites,
\v 2 he said to them, "Now I am already 120 years old. I am not strong to lead you all any longer. The LORD also said to me, 'You can not cross the Jordan River.'
\v 3 The LORD our God is the one who will cross that river before you all. He will destroy the nations that are before you all, and you all will take their land. Joshua will be the one who leads you to cross that river, as was stated by the LORD.
\v 4 The LORD will destroy the nations in that land like He destroyed Sihon and Og, the Amorite kings.
\v 5 The LORD will help you all subject those nations. And you all will kill all of them, according to the command that I deliver to you all.
\v 6 You all must be strong and brave. Don't be afraid of them because the LORD our God is with all of you. He will certainly always help you all and won't forsake you all."
\p
\v 7 Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in front of all of the Israelites, "You have to be strong and brave because you will lead this people to the land that was promised by the LORD to our forefathers to give to them, and you will lead them to conquer it.
\v 8 The LORD Himself will walk in front of you all and be with you all. He will always help you all and will not forsake you all. Because of that don't be afraid or tremble."
\s1 Regulation of reading the laws
\p
\v 9 Moses wrote all of those laws and gave them to the Levite priestsâ€” who had the task of carrying the Chest of Promise, and also to all of the leaders of Israel.
\v 10 Moses commanded them, "Every celebration of Leafy Huts in the seventh year, that is the year of releasing debts,
\v 11 you all must read these laws in front of all of the Israelites, when they come together to worship the LORD our God in the place He chooses. 
\v 12 Gather all of the people, both men, women, children and all foreigners who live among you all, so that they may hear these laws and learn to fear and honor the LORD God, along with truly obeying all of these laws.
\v 13 Do like that so that your descendants who don't know about those laws may learn them. They must learn to fear and honor the LORD God as long as they live in the land that you all will rule across the Jordan River."
\s1 The Israelites will betray the LORD
\p
\v 14 The LORD said to Moses, "Listen well, actually you will die not long from now. Because of that call Joshua, and come with him before Me in the Holy Tent so that I may send him as the new leader." Then Moses and Joshua came before [that] Holy Tent. 
\p 
\v 15 There, the LORD showed himself in a pillar of cloud near the tent door.
\v 16 The LORD said to Moses, "You will die not long from now. After you die, this nation will betray Me by worshiping other worships possessed by the nations in the land that they will enter like a woman who goes and prostitutes herself. They will forsake Me and transgress My covenant, that I made with them.
\v 17 When that happens, I will be very angry with them. I will forsake them and won't help them any longer, in fact I will destroy them. Many bad things will befall them, so that they say, 'Certainly this trouble happened because our God is no longer with us.'
\v 18 At that time I won't help them at all because they have done evil by worshiping other worships.
\p
\v 19 "Now write this song and teach it to the Israelites. They must memorize it, so that the song becomes My witness to them.
\v 20 I will bring them to the land that is very fertile, which I promised to their forefathers. There they will live prosperously and eat to their heart's content so that they become fat. But then they will turn to worship other worships. They will reject Me and deny My covenant.
\v 21 Because of that many disasters will befall them. At that time, this song will remind them regarding the reason I punish them, because they will always sing this song down through the generations. I know the way of their thinking even before they enter the land that I promised."
\p 
\v 22 On that day also Moses wrote that song poem and taught it to the Israelites.
\p
\v 23 Then the LORD said to Joshua the son of Nun, "You must be strong and brave because you will lead the Israelites to enter the land that I have promised to your forefathers to give to them. I will be with you."
\p
\v 24 After Moses finished writing all of the words of these laws in a book,
\v 25 he commanded the Levite priests who had the duty to carry the Chest of the LORD's covenant,
\v 26 "Take this book of law and place it next to the Chest of the Covenant, so this book becomes My witness to the Israelites and reminds them about My words when they transgress My law."
\p
\v 27 "I know that you all are very hard headed. When I was still living with you all you even frequently rebelled against the LORD, what about later after I die!
\v 28 So, gather all of the tribal elders and your leaders, so that I may speak directly to them and may the sky and earth become witnesses that I have delivered all of the LORD's laws to you all.
\v 29 I say this thing because I know that after I die, you all will do evil and turn from what I've commanded you all. At that time disasters will befall you all because you all make the LORD angry by doing what is evil before His eyes."
\s1 Moses teaches the song
\p
\v 30 Then Moses expressed all of the song lesson to all of the people of Israel.
