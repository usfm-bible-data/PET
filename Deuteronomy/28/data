\pi1
\v 19 Everything you do will be cursed.
\p
\v 20 "If you do evil and forsake the LORD, then He will send curses, chaos, and disappointment on everything you all do so that you all are quickly destroyed.
\pi1
\v 21 The LORD will also send [to] all of you plagues, \
\pi1 so that not one person among you will be left in the land that you will conquer.
\pi1
\v 22 The LORD will punish all of you with contagious diseases, fever and inflammation.

\pi1 These disasters will befall you until you are destroyed.
\pi1
\v 23 The sky above you will become like a bronze ceiling that prevents rain falling, and the ground beneath you will become as hard as iron.

\pi1 all of your bodies will itch and be full of ulcers and scabies,
\pi1 and nothing will heal them.
\pi1
\v 28 The LORD will make you crazy, blind and numb.

\pi1
\v 34 You will become insane seeing the horror that happens.
\pi1

\pi1 and nothing can heal you.
\pi1
\v 36 The LORD will allow you and your king that you've chosen to be brought as captives to a nation that you don't know or wasn't known by your forefathers.
\pi1 And there you all will worship gods made by human hands from wood and stone.
\pi1
\v 37 In the midst of other nations where the LORD brings you all, people will be horrified looking at what happens to you, you will become victims of vile treatment and become their objects of teasing.
\pi1
\v 38 You all will plant many seeds in the field, but the produce of its harvest will be very little because of being eaten by grasshoppers.
\v 39 You all will plant and care for vineyards, but won't drink its wine or harvest its fruit because worms will eat it all gone.

\p
\v 45 "If you all don't obey the LORD God, and don't do his commands that He gave to you, then all of these curses will keep falling on you until you are destroyed.
\v 46 All of these curses will become an amazing sign to warn you and point out the LORD's judgment to you and your descendants forever.
\v 47 Though the LORD God bestows you with many good things, yet you don't serve Him with joy and sincere hearts.
\v 48 Because of that, the LORD will send enemies to oppose you, and you all will serve them in hunger, thirst, nakedness, and lacking in everything. The LORD will allow your enemies to put very heavy burdens until you are destroyed.
\p
\v 49 "The LORD will send a nation from a far place, a nation that you don't know and their language you don't understand, to ambush you all like a fast flying eagle pounces on its prey,
\v 50 a nation that is strong and harsh, a nation that doesn't honor old people and doesn't have compassion on children.
\v 51 That nation will eat up your animals and the produce of your harvest, and there won't be any leftover wheat, wine, olive oil, or young cows and sheep at all for you, until they destroy you all.
\v 52 They will surround cities in all of your land, that the LORD God has given to you. They will knock down restraining walls that are high, that you rely on to protect you all.
\v 53 "For the duration of the seige, your enemies will make it so hard on you and hunger so that you will eat the meat of your own children, whom the LORD God has given to you.
\v 54 In fact the man who is most ? and sensitive among you won't share food with his brother, his own wife, and his only child that still lives at all.
\v 55 He doesn't want to share the meat of his own children with anyone, because he doesn't have any more at all, while the enemy surrounds all of your cities and makes you all suffer.
\v 56 In that way also the most weak ? and sensitive woman among you all, who doesn't usually set foot on the ground, will also be an enemy to her own husband and children.
\v 57 She will hide the baby that she just birthed along with its placenta and secretly eat them because of such hunger, while the enemy surrounds your cities and makes you all suffer.
\p
\v 58 "If you all do not truly obey all of the laws that are written in this book, and you all do not fear and respect the LORD God who is glorious and great,
\v 59 then the LORD will send endless horrible plagues on you and your descendants so that you will have prolonged severe illnesses.
\v 60 He will send all of the diseases on you that you witnessed and feared in Egypt and you won't get well.
\v 61 The LORD will also send every disease and plague that aren't written in this book, until you are destroyed.
\v 62 Even though your numbers are many like the stars in the sky, only a few of you will be saved, because you all don't obey the LORD God.
\p
\v 63 "Just as the LORD is happy to do good to you all and increase your number, so also the LORD is happy to ruin you and destroy you all. And you all will be snatched away from the land that you will enter and over power.
\v 64 The LORD will scatter you all among other nations in all the earth. There you will serve and worship false gods that are made from wood and stone, which you and your forefathers didn't know.
\v 65 In the midst of the nations you all won't have calmness or a place to rest, but on the contrary the LORD will make your hearts anxious, your eyes will be gloomy because of longing to go home, and your souls will be hopeless.
\v 66 Your lives will always be threatened with danger. Day and night you all will be afraid, not knowing whether or not you will stay alive.
\v 67 Your hearts will become fearful because of seeing things that are horrible so that in the morning you will say, 'If only it was now evening!' And in the evening you will say, 'If only it was now morning!'
\v 68 The LORD returns you to Egypt in groups by boat, a journey that was said by Him that you wouldn't pass again. There you each will try to sell yourselves as slaves to your enemies, but they won't buy you."
