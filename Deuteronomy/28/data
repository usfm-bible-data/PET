\li1
\v 19 All your efforts everywhere will be cursed.
\b
\li
\v 20 "If you do evil by leaving the LORD, then He will curse, confuse, and frustrate everything you do so that you will soon perish.
\li1
\v 21 The LORD will also afflict you with plagues,
\pi1 so that no one among you will be left in the land that you will soon possess.
\li1
\v 22 The LORD will strike you with contagious diseases, fevers, and with inflammatory diseases.

\li1
\v 23 The sky above you will be like a bronze roof that keeps the rain from falling, and the ground below will be as hard as iron.
\v 24 The LORD will not rain down water, but rain down dust from heaven until you perish.
\li1
\v 25 Whenever enemies attack you, the LORD will make you lose. When your troops attack enemy forces from one direction, you will scatter and run away from before them.
\li1 Seeing what happens to you, all other nations will feel disgusted and think that you are the most unfortunate people in the world.
\li1
\v 26 Your dead bodies will just be scattered about so that they are eaten by birds and wild animals. When that happens, no one from among you will still be alive to drive the birds and beasts away.
\b
\li1
\v 27 The LORD will make you get festering boils, just as was imposed by Him upon the Egyptians. Your whole body will itch and be full of bumps and scabies, and nothing will be able to cure you.\x + \xo 28:27 \xt Deut. 7:15\x*
\li1
\v 28 The LORD will drive you crazy, blind, and out of your mind.

\li1 You will continue to be bullied and robbed, but no one will help you.
\li1
\v 30 If you get engaged, other men will rape your fiancé. If you build a house, you won't have an opportunity to live in it. If you plant a vineyard, you will not enjoy the produce.\x + \xo 28:30 \xt Deut. 20:5-7\x*
\li1
\v 31 Your cattle will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of its meat. Your donkey will be seized and never returned. Your enemies will steal your sheep, and no one will defend your rights.
\li1
\v 32 Your sons and daughters will become prisoners of war and then become slaves in another land. Every day you will cry because you long to see them, but you can't do anything to help them.
\li1
\v 33 An enemy nation whose name you have never heard and whose language you do not understand will come from a far country and will plunder all your crops and all the fruit of your labor. You will continue to be bullied and treated cruelly.
\v 34 You will go crazy at the horror that occurs.
\li1
\v 35 The LORD will make your knees and thighs sore with boils that cannot be healed. The boils will spread throughout your whole body, from the soles of your feet to your scalp.
\li1
\v 36 The LORD will let the king of Israel and all his people be taken captive to a distant enemy land, a nation that is unknown to you or your ancestors. And in that land you will worship gods made by human hands from wood and stone.
\li1
\v 37 And among all the nations where the LORD has scattered you, the people will be terrified to see what has happened to you, and you will become the subject of their ridicule.

\li1
\v 38 You will plant many seeds in the field, but the yield will be just a small amount because the grasshoppers will eat it.

\li1
\v 43 The immigrant who lives among you will have increasingly more power over you, while you will become less and less powerful.\x + \xo 28:43 \xt Deut. 28:13\x*
\li1

\p
\v 45 "If you disobey the LORD God and do not keep His commandments that He has given you, all these curses will continue to fall on you until you perish.
\v 46 All these disasters will be evidence from the LORD to you and your descendants that everything is a punishment from Him.
\v 47 When you live in prosperity from the LORD your God in your own country, you will not want to be grateful and serve Him with pleasure.
\v 48 Therefore, the LORD will bring enemies against you, so that you are forced to serve them when you are hungry, thirsty, dirty, and lacking in everything. The LORD will let them enslave\f + \fr 28:48 \fk enslave \ft Literally, "put an iron yoke on your neck". This metaphor illustrates that the people of Israel will be unable to escape from slavery that is very severe.\f* and oppress you until death.
\p
\v 49-50 “The LORD will bring their troops from a far country, and they will catch you like an eagle upon its prey as fast as lightning. The people are strong and cruel, and you will not understand their language. They will have neither respect for the elderly nor compassion for children.
\v 51 The nation's army will eat up your livestock and all your crops until you starve to death. There will not be any grain, wine, olive oil, cattle and lamb left for you, and you will perish.
\v 52 They will surround the cities in all the land that the LORD is giving you. Even if the city where you take refuge is surrounded by a high fortress, they will bring down that fortress.
\p
\v 53-55 "As long as your city is under siege, you will experience such misery and depletion of food, that you will eat the flesh of your own children, the children whom the LORD has given you and whom you love. You will be so hungry that the most gentle and sensitive of you will have the heart to eat the flesh of his own child. Indeed he will not desire to share even a bit of that flesh with his relative, his wife whom he loves so much, and his only child who is still alive.
\v 56-57 Likewise, the most gentle and sensitive woman among you, as gentle as a princess who seems to never have set her feet on the ground, will have the heart to hide the baby she just gave birth to and its placenta, and then secretly eat it. Indeed she will not want to share even a bit of the flesh with her husband and other children.
\p
\v 58 "If you do not obey all the laws written in this book, and do not fear and honor the LORD Almighty God,
\v 59-60 then the LORD will bring disasters and various plagues on you and your offspring, that is, terrible diseases like the ones you saw when the LORD punished the Egyptians. You will suffer from that terrible pain for years and not be able to recover.
\v 61 The LORD will also bring about all kinds of plagues and other diseases that are not written in this book of the law of the LORD, until you are destroyed.
\p
\v 62-63 “Just as the LORD was pleased to do good to you and increase your number, He will also be happy to destroy and destroy you if you do not obey Him. Even if you were as numerous as the stars in the sky, only a few will survive after the LORD has punished you. And you will be eliminated from the fertile land which you will soon rule.
\v 64 The LORD will scatter you among the nations of all the earth. There you will worship gods made of wood and stone, unknown to you or your ancestors.
\v 65 Among these nations you will never be at ease. The LORD will make your heart troubled, your face gloomy because you long to go home, and your feelings are depressed.
\v 66 Your life will always be in danger. Day and night you are afraid and worry about whether you can stay alive.
\v 67 Because you see terrible things so often, you will live in fear all the time, so that in the morning you say, 'If it was night now!' And at night you would say, 'If it was morning!'
\v 68 The LORD will also send some of you to Egypt by ship, even though He has said that you will never see that land again. There you will be so destitute that you will try to offer yourself as a slave again to the Egyptians, but no one will buy you."
