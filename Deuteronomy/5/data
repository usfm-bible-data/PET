\s God’s Ten Commandments
\p
\v 1 Moses called all the people of Israel and said, “O people of Israel, hear the various statutes and rules that I convey to you today. Study and do it obediently.
\v 2 The LORD our God has made a covenant with us in the Mount of Sinai.
\v 3 This covenant is not only made with your parents, but also with us who are still alive at this moment.
\v 4 At that mountain the LORD spoke directly with you from the midst of fire.
\v 5 (At that time, I was standing between the LORD and you to convey the LORD’s words to you, because you were afraid of that fire and refused to go up to the mountain.) He said,
\li1
\v 6 ‘I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out of slavery in Egypt.
\li1
\v 7 Do not worship false gods. Worship me only.
\li1
\v 8 Do not make idols for yourselfs that look like anything that is in the sky or on the earth, or in the water.
\li1
\v 9 Do not bow down or worship it, because I, the LORD your God is a jealous God. Anyone who oppose Me by worshiping fake gods, I will punish until his third and fourth generations.
\v 10 But to the people who love me and are obedient to My commands, I will overflow My steadfast love, I will overflow Mu steadfast love over his family— until thousands of generations.
\li1
\v 11 Do not misuse My name, the LORD your God, because I will punish anyone who misuse My name.
\li1
\v 12 Remember My commands— the LORD your God— about the Sabbath day and keep the holiness of that day.
\li1
\v 13 For six days you work and do your daily activities,
\v 14 but on the seventh day— that is the Sabbath day— is the day where each of you must stop all work to respect Me— the LORD your God. On that day no one is allowed to do work— whether you yourself, or children, servants, livestocks, and sojourers who live together with you, so that everyone can rest like you.
\v 15 Remember that long ago you were enslaved in Egypt, but I— the LORD your God— brought you out from there with My large power. So, I command all of you to obey the Sabbath day rules.
\li1
\v 16 Honor your father and mother so that you will live long, and that you will live prosperously in the land that I— the LORD your God— gave to you.
\li1
\v 17 Do not kill any one.
\li1
\v 18 Do not do adultery.
\li1
\v 19 Do not steal.
\li1
\v 20 Do not lie about others.
\li1
\v 21 Do not desire for another man’s wife, or his house, his field, his male or female servants, his ox, his donkey, or his other posessions.’
\p
\v 22 The LORD conveyed these commands to all of you in that mountain with a loud voice from the midst of fire, and pitch darkness. This is all that He conveyed at that time, and He did not add any other thing. Then He wrote those commands on two stones and gave them to me.
\p
\v 23 “When you heard the sound from the midst of darkness while that mountain is blazing with fire, all your tribe chiefs and elders came to me
\v 24 and said, “Today the LORD our God has already showed us His glory and greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of fire. Now we know that a person can still live after hearing God speaks to him!
\v 25 But why we have to put our lives in danger again? If we continue to hear the LORD’s voice, we will surely die from getting burnt by that gerat fire!
\v 26 Surely there is no human that can stay alive after hearing the LORD speak directly from fire, as what we have experienced.
