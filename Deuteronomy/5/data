\v 1 Moses called all the people of Israel and said, “O people of Israel, hear the various statutes and rules that I convey to you today. Study and do it obediently.
\v 2 The LORD our God has made a covenant with us in the Mount of Sinai.
\v 3 This covenant is not only made with your parents, but also with us who are still alive at this moment.
\v 4 At that mountain the LORD spoke directly with you from the midst of fire.
\v 5 (At that time, I was standing between the LORD and you to convey the LORD’s words to you, because you were afraid of that fire and refused to go up to the mountain.) He said,

\v 6 ‘I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out of slavery in Egypt.
\li1
\v 7 Do not worship false gods. Worship me only.
\li1
\v 8 Do not make idols for yourselfs that look like anything that is in the sky or on the earth, or in the water.
\li1
\v 9 Do not bow down or worship it, because I, the LORD your God is a jealous God. Anyone who oppose Me by worshiping fake gods, I will punish until his third and fourth generations.
\v 10 But to the people who love me and are obedient to My commands, I will overflow My steadfast love, I will overflow Mu steadfast love over his family— until thousands of generations.
