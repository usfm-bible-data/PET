\s God’s Ten Commandments
\p
\v 1 Moses called all of the people of Israel and said, “O people of Israel, hear the various statutes and rules that I convey to you today. Study and do them obediently.
\v 2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Mount Sinai.
\v 3 This covenant is not only made with your parents, but also with us who are still alive now.
\v 4 On that mountain the LORD spoke directly with you from the midst of fire.
\v 5 (At that time, I was standing between the LORD and you to convey the LORD’s words to you, because you were afraid of that fire and refused to climb up to the top of the mountain.) He said,
\li1
\v 6 ‘I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out of slavery in Egypt.
\li1
\v 7 Do not worship false gods. Worship me only.
\li1
\v 8 Do not make idols for yourselves that look like anything that is in the sky, or on the earth, or in the deepest part of the sea. \x + \o 5:8 \xt Deut. 4:18\x*
\li1
\v 9 Do not bow down or worship them, because I, the LORD your God am a God who is jealous. Anyone who opposes Me by worshiping other worshipped beings I will punish up to his third and fourth generations.
\v 10 But to the people who love me and are obedient to My commands, I will overflow My steadfast love, I will overflow Mu steadfast love on his family— up to thousands of generations.
\li1
\v 11 Do not misuse My name, the LORD your God, because I will punish anyone who misuses My name.\f + \fr 5:11 \fk misuses My name \ft An example of misusing the LORD’s name in the Old Testament is to strengthen a witness about a matter by saying, “May the LORD punish me if I lie.” If a person says that, if he actually is lying, he deserves to be punished by the LORD for two sins: for lying and for misusing the LORD’s name. Another example is to promise to do something by saying, “Let the LORD punish me if I don’t do this.” If after that the person who said that does not keep his promise, he has misused the LORD’s name. Another example is when using the LORD’s name in a context that is not honoring to Him, such as when speaking angrily to someone.\f*
\li1
\v 12 Remember My, the LORD your God's commands— about the Sabbath day and guarding the holiness of that day.
\li1
\v 13 For six days you work and do your daily activities,
\v 14 but on the seventh day— that is the Sabbath day— is the day when each of you must stop all work in order to respect Me— the LORD your God. On that day no one is allowed to do work— either you yourself, or children, servants, livestock, and new-comers who live together with you— so that everyone can rest like you.
\v 15 Remember that you were previously enslaved in Egypt, but I— the LORD your God— brought you out from there with My great power. Because of that, I command all of you to obey the Sabbath day rules.
\li1
\v 16 Honor your father and mother so that you will live long, and so that you will live prosperously in the land that I— the LORD your God— give to you.
\li1
\v 17 Do not kill any one.
\li1
\v 18 Do not commit adultery.
\li1
\v 19 Do not steal.
\li1
\v 20 Do not lie about others.
\li1
\v 21 Do not desire the wife of another man, or his house, his field, his male or female servants, his ox, his donkey, or his other posessions.’
\p
\v 22 "The LORD conveyed these commands to all of you on that mountain with a loud voice from the midst of fire, clouds, and pitch darkness. This is all of the things that He conveyed at that time, and He did not add any other thing. Then He wrote those commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
\p
\v 23 “When you heard the sound from the midst of darkness while that mountain was blazing with fire, all of your tribal chiefs and elders came to me
\v 24 and said, “Today the LORD our God has already showed us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of fire. Now we know that a person can still live after hearing God speak to him!
\v 25 But why do we have to put our lives in danger again? If we continue to hear the LORD’s voice, we will surely die from getting burned by that great fire!
\v 26 Surely there is no human that can remain alive after hearing the LORD speak directly from fire, as we have experienced.
\v 27 Let you yourself climb up that mountain to draw near to Him and listen to all that will be said by the LORD our God. After that, convey all that He said to us, and we promise to obey it.’\x + \xo 5:27 \xt Exo. 20:18-21\x*
\p
\v 28 “The LORD has heard the words of your leaders to me at that time, so because of that when I returned to the mountain to meet the LORD, He said,
\p ‘I've heard what those leaders said to you, and what they said is good.
\mi
\v 29 Oh, how good it would be if their hearts were always like this— always fearing and respecting Me and being obedient to My commands! In that way, they would live prosperously for generation to generation forever.
\v 30 Go down and say to them, “ Go home to your own tents.”
\v 31 Then return here to meet Me, so I can give all the commands, statutes, and rules to you. Teach all of this to them, so that they obey when they are in the land that I will give to them.’
\p
\v 32 Based on the word of the LORD I say to each of you, “Obey all of the commands of the LORD your God. Do not go against even one of those comands.
\v 33 May you live according to all that was commanded to you by the LORD your God, so that you will be successful and may remain long in the land that you will possess.”
