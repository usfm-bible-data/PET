\s The Ten Commandments
\p
\v 1 Moses called all the Israelites and said, "O people of Israel, today I convey all the rules and regulations for you. Listen so that you can learn and obey it faithfully.
\v 2 The LORD our God has made a covenant with us on Mount Sinai.\f + \fr 5: 2 \fk Mount Sinai \ft Literally 'Horeb'. TSI usually translates 'Horeb' as 'Mount Sinai', because the name is more familiar to today's readers.\f*
\v 3 That covenant, which was made with us who are still alive to this day, is not the same as the covenant He made with our ancestors.
\v 4 On the mountain the LORD spoke directly to us from the midst of the fire.
\v 5 At that time, I interceded to deliver the words of the LORD to you, because you were afraid of the fire and did not want to go up on the mountain. He says,
\li1
\v 6 'I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of slavery in Egypt.
\li1
\v 7 Do not worship any god. Just worship me!
\li1
\v 8 Do not make yourselves an idol like anything in the heavens, or on the earth, or in the sea.\x + \xo 5: 8 \xt Deut. 4:18\x*
\li1
\v 9 Do not bow down or worship him, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God. Anyone who opposes Me by worshiping gods will I punish until his third and fourth generations.
\v 10 But to those who love me and keep My commandments, I will show my kindness to their families for thousands of generations.
\li1
\v 11 Do not abuse my name, the LORD your God, for I will punish anyone who misuses My name.\f + \fr 5:11 \fk misuse My name \ft An example of abusing the name of the LORD that is in the OT is to strengthen testimony about a case by saying, "Let the LORD punish me if I lie." If someone says that, but he is actually lying, he is already worthy of being punished by God for two sins: lying and abusing the name of God. Another example is promising to do something by saying, "Let God punish me if I don't do it." If after that a person does not keep his promise, he will abuse the name of the LORD. Another example is when you use the name LORD in a context that doesn't honor Him, such as when you curse someone else.\f*
\li1
\v 12 Remember My commandments, the LORD your God, concerning the Sabbath day, and keep it holy.
\v 13 Six days each week are given to you to work and carry out your daily activities,
\v 14 But on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, each one of you must stop all your work in my honor. That day, no one may do the work — whether you are alone, or the children, servants, livestock, and migrants who live with you — so that all can rest like you.
\v 15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, but I brought you out of there by my great power. Therefore, I command all of you to obey the Sabbath rules.
\li1
\v 16 Honor your father and mother, as the LORD your God has commanded, that you may live in prosperity and may remain in the land that I have given you.
\li1
\v 17 Don't kill anyone.
\li1
\v 18 Do not commit adultery.
\li1
\v 19 Don't steal.
\li1
\v 20 Don't lie about your neighbor.
\li1
\v 21 Do not covet someone else's wife, or his house, his farm, his male or female servant, his cow, his donkey, or anything else of his.'

\v 22 "The LORD gave these commands to all of us on the mountain with a loud voice from the midst of fire and cloud, and great darkness. That was all He said that day. Then He wrote the commandments on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
\p
\v 23 "When you heard the voice from the middle of the darkness while the mountain was burning with fire, all the chiefs and elders came to me.
\v 24 and said, "Today the LORD our God has shown us his glory and majesty, and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire. Now we know that people can still live after hearing God speak to them!
\v 25-26 But do not risk our lives anymore. Surely no human can survive after hearing the LORD speak directly from the fire, as we have experienced. If we continue to listen to the voice of the LORD, we will surely burn to death by that terrible fire!
\v 27 Let you, as you go up into the mountain, draw near to Him yourself, and listen to all that the LORD our God will say. After that, tell us everything. We promise to stick to it.'\x + \xo 5:27 \xt Ex. 20:18-21\x*
\p
\v 28 "The LORD heard the pleas of your chiefs and leaders, then when I met the LORD again on the mountain, He said, 'I have heard what the people said to you, and what they said was good.
\v 29 Oh, how good it would be if their hearts could always be like this, always fear and respect Me and obey My commandments! If this continues, they will live in prosperity from generation to generation to eternity.
\v 30 Go down and send them back to their tents.
\v 31 Then come back here to meet Me, so that I may give you all the commandments, rules and regulations. Teach them all this, so that they may obey in the land which I will give them.'
\p
\v 32 According to what the LORD has said, I will make it clear to each of you, “Keep all the commandments of the LORD your God. Don't break any of the commandments.
\v 33 You are to live according to all the commandments of the LORD God to you, so that you may live in prosperity and may remain in the land that you are soon having.”
