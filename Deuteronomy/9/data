\c 9
\s1 The reason the LORD made them win
\p
\v 1 “O people of Israel, listen to me! Today you are ready to cross the Jordan River to drive away nations greater and stronger than you. Their cities are large and have high fortification walls that reach the sky.
\v 2 The people are giants— they are the descendants of Anakites. You have heard people say about them, ‘Who can fight those Anakites?!’
\v 3 So, today you must know that it is the LORD your God who will go ahead of you to attack your enemies. He will take action like fire that burns to destroy them. The LORD will make them powerless to attack you. You will drive them away and seize their land like He promised you.
\p
\v 4 “After the LORD your God drive them away from your face, do not say in your heart, ‘The LORD gave this land to me because I live righteously in His eyes.’ Actually the LORD drive away those nations from your face because of their evilness.
\v 5 So, it is not because you live righteously or have righteous heart that the LORD gave this nation to you. The LORD drive them away because of their evilness, and He intend to fulfill His promise that He made to our ancestors— Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\v 6 Realize that it is not because you deserve it that the LORD your God gave this good land for you to conquer. In fact, you are hardheaded people!”
\s1 Moses reminds (them) about the Israelites’ rebellion
\p
\v 7 “Remember and don’t forget how you rrepeatedly made the LORD your God angry in the wilderness. You rebelled against the LORD since you left Egypt, rebelled while you were in the wilderness, and continue to rebell up to this place.
\v 8 Remember when in the Mount of Sinai, you made the LORD so angry that He was going to destroy you.
\v 9 That time the LROD told me to hike up the Mount of Sinai to receive two tablets of stone that symbolize the covenant\f + \fr 9:9 symbolize the covenant\fk \ft It is often said that the two stone tablets are written with the Ten Commandments. But in here the Hebrew word writes ‘luhot habberit’ (tablets of the covenant). This shows that the Ten Commandments carved on the two tablets of stone are the biggest conditions of the official commandment that the LORD made with the nation of Israel.\f*that the LORD made with us. So I stayed there without eating and drinking for forty days and forty nights.
\v 10 The LORD gave to us two tablets of stone that is written with His own finger. He wrote on the stone all the commandments that he ad said to us from the midst of fire on that mountain where we were gathered.
\p
\v 11 “The LORD gave the two tablets of stone on the last day of the forty days and forty nights. Both of those tablets of stone are symbols of the covenant that He made with us.
\v 12 Then He said to me, ‘Rise up and go down immediately from here because the nation that you led out of Egypt has done a scary sin! They are worshipping the statue of a calf that they made from gold. How fast they turn away from the path that I commanded!’
\p
\v 13 “And the LORD said again to me, ‘I’ve been paying attention to this nation and they are truly a hard-headed nation!
\v 14 So, don’t try to stop Me! I will destroy them so that there is no one who remembers their names on this earth. Then I will make you into an ancestor of a nation that will be more numerous and stronger than them.’
\p
\v 15 “Then I turned my back and descended to mountain, bringing the two tablets of stonethe LORD’s covenant with us. At that time fire is still burning on that mountain.
\v 16 Then I saw that you already made a big sin towards the LORD our God. You already made a statue of calf from gold. You turned away really fast from the path that the LORD commanded!
\v 17 So in front of your eyes I lifted up the two tablets of stone and threw them to the ground so that it broke to many pieces.
\p
\v 18 “Then I left to be alone and bowed down before the LORD for forty days and forty nights— like I did before. I did not eat and drink during those period. I did that because you already did a great evil towards the LORD that caused Him to be angry.
\v 19 I am very afraid because the LORD was very angry towards you, so much that He wanted to destroy all of you. But even this time He listened to my prayers.
\v 20 The LORD was also very angry towards Aaron so that He was ready to destroy him, but at the same time I also prayed for him.
\v 21 Then, I threw the calf statue— the item that resulted from your sinful deeds— into the fire until it melts. After that, I destroyed it until it was fine like dust and threw the dust into the river that flowed from that mountain.
\p
\v 22 “You also made the LORD very angry in Taberah, in Massah, and in Kibroth-hattaavah.
\v 23 When the LORD commanded you to go away from Kadesh-barnea by saying, ‘Go and conquer the land that I will give to you,you rebelled against the LORD God, refusing to believe, and were disobedient to Him.
\v 24 You frequently rebelled against the LORD ever since I knew you.
\p
\v 25 “So for forty days and forty nights I laid down with my face to the ground— pleading before the LORD, because He already said that He will destroy you.
\v 26 I prayed to the LORD saying, “O LORD, my Lord, don’t destroy your people. They are Yours, who You rescued and freed from Egypt with Your great power.
\v 27 Remember the commandment that You made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But don’t remember that this nation is so hard-headed by repeatedly doing evil and doing sin.
\v 28 If You destroy them, then the Egyptians will say that You are unable to bring them to the land that You promised to give to them and that You brought them to the wilderness just to kill them there, because You hate them.
\v 29 Remember that they are Your people, Yours. You already brought them out of Egypt with Your great power.”
