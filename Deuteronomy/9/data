\s1 The reason the LORD causes Israel to win
\p
\v 1 Next Moses taught, “O Israelites, listen to me! Today you are ready to cross the Jordan River to drive out the nations that are stronger and more numerous than you. Their cities are large and have defensive walls as high as the sky.
\v 2 There are giants there who come from the line of Anak. They are tall, big and strong. You have heard people speak of them like this, 'Who can stand against those Anakites?!'
\v 3 But realize today that the LORD our God will go before you to attack your enemies. He will act like a consuming fire to destroy them, so that you can drive them out and take their land, according to the LORD's promise.
\p
\v 4 "After the LORD our God drives them out of your presence, do not think, 'The LORD gave this land to me because I have lived righteously in His eyes.' Surely the LORD cast out those nations from before you because they were evil.
\v 5 So the LORD gives this land to you, not because you are righteous or have good attributes, but because of their wickedness! Another reason the LORD is driving out those nations is because He wants to keep His promise that He made with our ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\v 6 Realize that it is not because you are worthy that the LORD is giving this good land to you to possess. Truly, you are stubborn people!"
\s1 Moses calls to mind the rebellion of the Israelites
\p
\v 7 Next, Moses told the people of Israel, “Remember and don't forget how many times you made the LORD your God angry in the wilderness. You have rebelled against the LORD from the time you left Egypt, while in the wilderness, and you have continued to rebel until arriving here.
\v 8 Remember while at Mount Sinai you made the LORD so angry that he wanted to destroy you.
\v 9 At that time the LORD told me to climb Mount Sinai to receive two stone tablets that symbolized the LORD's covenant\f + \fr 9:9 \fk symbolized the covenant \ft It is often said that the two stone tablets were inscribed with the Ten Commandments. But here the Hebrew has 'the tablets of the covenant'. This shows that the Ten Commandments engraved on the two stone tablets were the main conditions of the covenant that God made with the nation of Israel.\f* with us. I remained there without food or drink for forty days and forty nights.
\v 10 The LORD gave me two stone tablets that were inscribed with His own finger. He wrote on the stone all the commandments He had spoken to us from the midst of the fire on Mount Sinai where we were gathered.
\p
\v 11 “The LORD gave these two stone tablets on the last day of the forty days and forty nights. The two stone tablets are the central symbol of the covenant He has made with us.
\v 12 Then He said to me, 'Get up and go down quickly from here, because the people you led out of Egypt have committed a terrible sin! They are worshiping a statue of a calf they made from gold. How quickly they have deviated from the path I commanded!'
\p
\v 13 "The LORD also said, 'I have seen how stubborn this nation is!
\v 14 Therefore, do not try to stop Me! I will destroy them so that later on no one on earth will remember that there was a nation called Israel. Then I will make your descendants a nation that is more numerous and stronger than them.'
\p
\v 15 "So I came down from Mount Sinai with the two stone tablets. The fire was still burning on the mountain.
\v 16 Before I got to the bottom, I could see that you had committed a grave sin against the LORD our God. You had made a statue of a calf out of gold. You were so quick to turn aside from the path that the LORD had commanded!
\v 17 So before your eyes I lifted the two stone tablets and threw them to the ground so that they broke into pieces.
\p
\v 18 "Then I went off by myself and bowed before the LORD for forty days and forty nights, as I had done before. I didn't eat or drink during that time. I did that because you had done a great evil against the LORD so that He was angry.
\v 19 I was afraid because the LORD was so angry with you that He wanted to destroy you all. But this time also He listened to my prayer.
\v 20 The LORD was angry with Aaron, so that he wanted to destroy him, but at that time I also prayed for him.
\v 21 I also threw the statue of the calf, which was the product of your sinful actions, into the fire until it melted. After that, I crushed it until it was smooth like dust, then threw the dust into the river that flows from Mount Sinai.
\p
\v 22 "You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah.\x + \xo 9:22 \xt Num. 11:1-3; Ex. 17:1-7; Num. 11:31-34\x*
\v 23 When the LORD sent you out of Kadesh Barnea saying, 'Go and possess the land that I'm going to give to you,' you rebelled against the LORD by being unwilling to trust His words and disobeying Him.
\v 24 You have often rebelled against the LORD since I came to know you.
\p
\v 25 “So for forty days and forty nights I bowed down while praying before the LORD, because He had already said that He would destroy you.
\v 26 I prayed to the LORD, “O LORD, my ruler, do not destroy Your people. They are your possession, which You saved and delivered from Egypt by Your great power.
\v 27 Remember the covenant that You made with Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But do not remember how stubborn this nation is by repeatedly doing evil and committing sins.
\v 28 If You destroy them, the Egyptians will say, 'It turns out that the god of the Israelites was unable to bring them to the land that he promised them! Or maybe their god hated the Israelites so he took them into the wilderness just to kill them!'
\v 29 So I ask You to keep in mind that they are Your people and Your possession which You have set apart, and which You have brought out of Egypt with Your great power."
