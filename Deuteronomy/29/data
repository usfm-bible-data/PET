\c 29
\p
\v 1 The LORD gave all these laws and explanations to Moses when the Israelites were still camping in the territory of Moab. These things describe the covenant with the LORD that was established at Mount Sinai.
\s1 The people of Israel must live according to the LORD's covenant
\p
\v 2 Moses summoned all the Israelites and delivered a message of the LORD to them, “In Egypt you have seen all that the LORD did to the king of Egypt, his officials, and all his people.
\v 3 You have seen with your own eyes the calamities and wonders that the LORD has done.
\v 4 But to this day, the LORD has not opened your minds to understand the meaning of all that you have experienced.
\v 5 The LORD has told you this, 'For forty years I led you through the wilderness, the clothes and footwear that you wore did not become worn.
\v 6 During that time, you also did not eat bread, drink wine, or enjoy beer, but I provided everything you needed. In this way I have proven that I am the LORD your God.'"
\p
\v 7 “And when we arrived at this place, King Sihon of Hesbon and King Og of Bashan attacked us. But we defeated them.
\v 8 We took their land and distributed it to the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh as their inheritance.
\p
\v 9 “Therefore keep all the provisions of our covenant with the LORD, that He may bless all your efforts.
\v 10 Today, all of you — including the tribal leaders, elders, officers, and all the men of Israel — are standing before the LORD our God.
\v 11 There are also with us your children and wives, and all the immigrants who live among us, who chop wood and draw water.
\v 12 You are gathered here to declare that you are willing to accept all the provisions of the covenant that the LORD God has ratified with us today.
\v 13 By binding this covenant, we are confirmed as His people, and we acknowledge that the LORD is our God. Therefore we will fulfill what the LORD has told us and the covenant that He ratified with our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\v 14 The LORD made this covenant not only with us
\v 15 who are now present before Him, but also with our future descendants.
\p
\v 16 “You all know how our people used to live in Egypt and then walked through the territories of other nations.
\v 17 You also saw their idols which were made of wood, stone, silver, and gold. All of that is very detestable.
\v 18 Be sure not to let any man, woman, family, or tribe leave the LORD by worshiping the gods of other nations. People who do this can become a bad influence among us, like a poisonous plant that can poison people, so that many become infected with their evil deeds.\x + \xo 29:18 \xt Heb. 12:15 \x*
\p
\v 19 "If there is a fool among you who hears the terms of this covenant and says in his heart, 'I will be safe even if I live as I please,' then it will bring disaster to all of you, both the wicked and the good.
\v 20-21 The LORD will not be willing to forgive such a fool. The LORD will separate him from among the tribes of Israel and bring out his jealousy and anger on him like a consuming fire. All the curses written in the book of the law and the provisions of the LORD's covenant will fall upon him and his descendants, until the LORD destroys them.\f + \fr 29:20 \fk and his descendants... \ft Literally the Hebrew says, 'The LORD will erase his name from under the sky.' Not only will the fool himself be punished, but there will be no successor to his family.\f*
\p
\v 22-23 "Over time various curses of disaster and plague that are repeatedly inflicted will have an impact. The entire land of Israel will be damaged by brimstone and salt, so that nothing can be planted, even weeds will not grow. That land will be like the cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma, and Zeboiim, which the LORD destroyed in his anger. Then visitors from other nations, even the remainder of your descendants who are still alive,
\v 24-25 will ask, 'Why did the LORD, the God of their ancestors, do this to this land?! What made Him so angry?'
\p "Then the people will say, 'This is because the Israelites did not live according to the laws and provisions of the covenant that they made with the LORD, when He brought them out of Egypt.
\v 26 They strayed by bowing down to worship gods they had never known before, and that were forbidden by the LORD.
\v 27 This deed is what caused the LORD's anger to burn, so that he cursed their land, according to the warning which is written in the book of the law of the LORD.
\v 28 Finally, in his anger, the LORD uprooted the Israelites from their country and cast them to another country, where they have lived to this day.'"
\p
\v 29 And in closing, Moses said, “There are things that the LORD God has kept secret from us. But for all that He has revealed, we and our descendants are responsible for doing it. That means we must obey all the laws and regulations in this book."
