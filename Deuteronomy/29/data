\c 29
\p
\v 1 The LORD gave all these laws and explanations to Moses when the Israelites were still camping in the territory of Moab. These things describe the covenant with the LORD that was established at Mount Sinai.
\s1 The people of Israel must live according to God's covenant
\p
\v 2 Moses summoned all the Israelites and delivered the LORD's message to them, “In Egypt you have seen all that the LORD did to the king of Egypt, his officials, and all his people.
\v 3 You have seen with your own eyes the calamities and wonders that the LORD has done.
\v 4 But to this day, the LORD has not opened your minds to understand the meaning of all that you have experienced.
\v 5 The LORD has told you this, 'For forty years I led you through the wilderness, the clothes and footwear that you wore did not become worn.
\v 6 During this time, you also did not eat bread, drink wine, or enjoy beer, but I have provided everything you need. In this way I prove that I am the LORD your God.‘"
\p
\v 7 “And when we arrived at this place, King Sihon of Hesbon and King Og of Bashan attacked us. But we beat them.
\v 8 We took their land and distributed it to the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh as their inheritance.
\p
\v 9 “Therefore keep all the provisions of our covenant with the LORD, that He may bless all your efforts.
\v 10 Today, all of you — including the tribal leaders, elders, officers, and all the men of Israel — are standing before the LORD our God.
\v 11 There are also with us your children and wives, and all the migrants who live among us, who work chopping wood and drawing water.
\v 12 You are gathered here to declare that you are willing to accept all the provisions of the covenant that the LORD God has validated with us today.
\v 13 By binding this covenant, we are confirmed as His people, and we acknowledge that the LORD is our God. In this way we will fulfill what God has told us and the covenants that He confirmed with our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\v 14 God made this covenant not only with us
\v 15 who are now present before Him, but also with our future descendants.
\p
\v 16 “You all know how our people used to live in Egypt and then walked through the territories of other nations.
\v 17 You also saw their idols which were made of wood, stone, silver, and gold. All of that is so disgusting.
\v 18 Be sure not to let any man, woman, family, or tribe leave the LORD by worshiping the gods of other nations. People who do this can become a bad influence among us, like a poisonous plant that can poison people, so that many are infected with their crimes.\x + \xo 29:18 \xt Heb. 12:15 \x*
\p
\v 19 "If there is a fool among you who hears the terms of this agreement and says in his heart, 'I will be saved even if I live as I please,' then it will bring disaster to all of you, both evil and good.
\v 20-21 The LORD will not be willing to forgive such a fool. The LORD will separate him from among the tribes of Israel and bring out his jealousy and anger on him like a consuming fire. All the curses written in the book of the law and the provisions of the LORD's covenant will fall upon him and his descendants, until the LORD destroys them.\f + \fr 29:20 \fk and his descendants ... \ft Literally Hebrew says, 'The LORD will erase his name from under the heavens. 'Not only the fool himself will be punished, but there will be no successor to his family.\f*
\p
\v 22-23 "Over time various curses of disaster and disease outbreaks that are repeatedly inflicted will have an impact. The land of all the land of Israel would be damaged by brimstone and salt, so that nothing could be planted, not even weeds to grow. That land will be like the cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma, and Zeboiim, which the LORD destroyed in his anger. So visitors from other nations even the rest of your descendants are still alive
\v 24-25 will ask, 'Why did the LORD, the God of their fathers, do this to this land?! What made Him so angry?'
\p "Then the people would say, 'This is because the Israelites were no longer living according to the laws and covenant provisions which they made with the LORD, when He brought them out of Egypt.
\v 26 They strayed by bowing down to worship the gods they had never known before, and whom the LORD had forbidden.
\v 27 This act was what caused the LORD's anger to burn, so that he cursed their land, according to the warning which is written in the book of the LORD's law.
\v 28 Finally, in his anger, the LORD uprooted the Israelites from their country and dumped them to another country, where they have lived to this day.‘"
\p
\v 29 And in closing, Moses said, “There are things that the LORD God keeps secret from us. But for all that He has revealed, we and our descendants are responsible for doing it. That means we must obey all the laws and regulations in this book."
