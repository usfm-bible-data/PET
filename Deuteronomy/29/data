\c 29
\s1 When the LORD's covenant with Israel was renewed
\p
\v 1 When Israel stayed in the land of Moab, Moses explained to the people of Israel the statutes of the covenant with the LORD which was established with Him at Mount Sinai.
\p
\v 2 Moses called all of the Israelites and delivered the LORD's message to them, "In Egypt you all had witnessed everything that the LORD did to the king of Egypt, his officials, and the whole land.
\v 3 You all had seen with your own eyes, the disasters and miracles that He did.
\v 4 But until today, the LORD has not yet granted you thinking that understands, eyes that see, or ears that hear.
\v 5 He has told you all, 'For as long as forty years I've led you all through the wilderness. For that length of time your clothes and sandals that you've worn didn't become worn.
\v 6 For that length of time you didn't make bread or drink wine or other hard drinks, but I prepared everything that you needed. I did this so that you would know that I am the LORD, your God.
\p
\v 7 "And when we were near this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan attacked us. But we defeated them.
\v 8 We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben, Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh as their inheritance.
\p
\v 9 "Because of that obey the statutes of this covenant and do them, so that everything you all do will succeed.
\v 10 On this day, you all stand before the LORD our Godâ€” the tribal leaders, elders, officers, and all the men of Israel,
\v 11 together with your children and wives, and all of the foreigners that live among you, who work to cut wood and fetch water,
\v 12 you all gather here to enter into the covenant with the LORD God, along with its statutes. Today the LORD God makes this covenant with you all.
\v 13 By binding this covenant, today we will become His people and the LORD becomes our God, like what He promised to us and our forefathers, who are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
\v 14 The LORD doesn't just bind this covenant with you all
\v 15 who stand together with us before the LORD God on this day, but also with your descendants in days to come.
\p
\v 16 "You all know how previously our nation lived in Egypt and then journeyed through the districts of other nations.
\v 17 Each of you also have seen their idol statues which are disgusting, that are made from wood, stone, silver and gold.
\v 18 Be sure there is no one among you, either male, female, family or tribe that forsakes the LORD God, by worshiping false gods from other nations. People who do that are like tree roots that produce bitter and poisonous fruit.
\p
\v 19 "If any of you who hear the statutes of this covenant and say in your heart, 'I will be saved even though I live as I please,' then that situation will cause you all to be destroyed, both those who are evil and those who are good.
\v 20 The LORD won't be ready to forgive a person like that, and because of feeling jealous, His anger will be vented on that person. All of the curses that are written in this book will fall on him, and the LORD will destroy him.\f + \fr 29:20 \fk The LORD will destroy him. \ft Literally the LORD will erase his name from ? under the sky.\f*
\v 21 The LORD will separate that person from among the tribes of Israel and pour out all of the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law.
\p
\v 22 "Then your descendants, that is your children and grandchildren that will come and foreigners from far lands will see the disasters and diseases that the LORD pours out on this land.
\v 23 The ground in the whole land will be ruined by sulfur and salt so that nothing can be planted. In fact weeds won't be able to grow there. That land will become like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Adma and Zeboiim, that were destroyed by the LORD in His wrath.
\v 24 And all other nations will ask, "Why did the LORD do that to this land? What made Him so angry?"
\p
\v 25 "Then people will answer, 'This happened because they ignored the covenant with the LORD God of their forefathers, that He made when He brought them out of Egypt.
\v 26 The went, knelt and worshiped false gods, that they had never previously known, and that were forbidden by the LORD.
\v 27 Those deeds of theirs are what made the LORD angry and send all of the curses that are written in this book on this land.
\v 28 In His wrath, the LORD pulled them from their land and threw them to other lands, that is where they live to this day.'
\p
\v 29 "There are things that the LORD God hides from us. But He expressed His laws to us and to our descendants, so that we keep obeying His laws."
