\s1 Haman plans to kill the Jews
\p
\v 1 After a while, King Ahasuerus appointed Haman to become second in all all of his territories. Haman was the son of Hammedatha, an Agagite.
\v 2 The king commanded all of his servants to respect Haman by bowing down in front of him. All of them obeyed that command except Mordecai who did not bow down to Haman.
\v 3 The other servants saw this and asked Mordecai, "Why don't you obey the king's command?"
\v 4 Mordecai told them that he was a Jew. Everyday, the servants asked this to Mordecai, but he kept his convictions and did not want to bow down. So they reported this situation to Haman, because they wanted to know what action he would take.
\p
\v 5 When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down to him, he became very angry.
\v 6 After learning that Mordecai was a Jew, Haman decided to destroy all the Jews in all the districts of King Ahasuerus’ kingdom, because he feel dissatisfied only eliminating
\p
\v 7 So in the first month that is the month of Nisan, \f + \fr 3:7 \fk month of Nisan \ft the first month of the Hebrew calendar is the month of Nisan which in our dating system now would be considered to fall between the middle of the month of March up to the middle of the month of April\f* the twelfth year in the reighn of King Ahasuerus, Haman commanded the advisors to cast lots to determine the day and month to kill the Jews. In the Jewish language, 'lots' was called 'pur'. The advisors did Haman's command. From the results of the 'lots', the day that was determined was the seventh of the twelfth month, which was the month of Adar \f + \fr 3:7 \fk month of Adar \ft the twelfth month in the Hebrew calendar was the month of Adar. In the dating system now it is considered to fall in the middle of the month of February up to the middle of the month of March\f*in the following year.
\p
\v 8 Then Haman approached the king and said to him, "Majestic King, there is a group of people who live in various provinces in the kingdom who have cultural practices that are different than all other people groups. They don't obey your laws and commands. Don't let them do as their hearts like.
\v 9 If your Majesty has no objection, put out a letter of command to destroy them. And If your Majesty wants to receive this suggestion, then your servant will give 340,000 kilograms of silver to put into the country's cash."
\v 10 The King agreed, then took off his signet ring \f + \fr 3:10 \fk signet ring- \ft The king's signet ring was used as a stamp that legitimized all documents of the king's decisions.\f* from his finger and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite who was the great enemy of the Jews.
\v 11 The king said to Haman, "I surrender the Jewish people group and my silver to you. Do what you see best toward them."
\p
\v 12 So on the 13th day of the first month, Haman called the country's secretaries to write a letter of decision addressed to every governor, district head, mayor and other officials in all the provinces. Copies of that letter mentioned were made in every language and alphabet that was used in every province. All of the copies of that letter were legitimized using the name and stamp of King Ahasuerus and were sent to every province in the whole kingdom so that every person knew and was ready to do it.
\v 13 The contents of that letter were a command that all the Jewish people— both young and old, the women's group and children, had to be killed in one day. The day that was determined was the 13th day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar of the following year. It was also explained in that letter that the Jewish people's valued possessions could be seized and taken by anyone who killed a Jewish person.
\p
\v 14 The copies of the letter acted as laws that had to be done in every province and were publicized so that everyone would know and be ready to carry out the command on the day that had been appointed.
\v 15 In accord with the king's command messengers departed quickly accompanying the letters to all the provinces of the kingdom. That command was publicized also in Susa, the capital city of Persia. While the people of the city of Susa were stirred up by that news, the king and Haman infact were sitting drinking wine.
