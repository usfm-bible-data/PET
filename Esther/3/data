\s1 Haman’s plan to kill the Jews
\p
\v 1 After a while, King Ahasuerus appointed Haman to become second in all all of his territories. Haman was the son of Hammedatha, an Agagite.
\v 2 The king commanded all of his servants to respect Haman by bowing down in front of him. All of them obeyed that command except Mordecai who did not bow down to Haman.
\v 3 The other servants saw this and asked Mordecai, "Why don't you obey the king's command?"
\v 4 Mordecai told them that he was a Jew. Everyday, the servants asked this to Mordecai, but he kept his convictions and did not want to bow down. So they reported this situation to Haman, because they wanted to know what action he would take.
\p
\v 5 When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down to him, he became very angry.
\v 6 After learning that Mordecai was a Jew, Haman decided to destroy all the Jews in all the districts of King Ahasuerus’ kingdom, because he felt dissatisfied if he eliminated Mordecai only.
\p
\v 7 So in the first month that is the month of Nisan, \f + \fr 3:7 \fk month of Nisan \ft the first month of the Hebrew calendar is the month of Nisan which in our dating system now would be considered to fall between the middle of the month of March up to the middle of the month of April\f* the twelfth year in the reighn of King Ahasuerus, Haman commanded the seers to cast lots to determine the day and month to kill the Jews. In the Jewish language, 'lots' was called 'pur'. The seers did Haman's command. From the results of the lots, the day that was determined was the seventh of the twelfth month, which was the month of Adar \f + \fr 3:7 \fk month of Adar \ft the twelfth month in the Hebrew calendar was the month of Adar. In the dating system now it is considered to fall in the middle of the month of February up to the middle of the month of March\f*in the following year.
\p
\v 8 Then Haman approached the king and said to him, “Your majesty the King, there is a group of people who live in the whole territory of my Lord, who don't obey the King's laws, because they have laws that are different from all the other nations that are in the territories of my Lord. This is harmful to the King if they remain alive.
\v 9 If your Majesty does not object, put out a letter of command to destroy them. And If your Majesty wants to receive this suggestion, then your servant will give 340,000 kilograms of silver to put into the royal treasury."
\v 10 The King agreed, then took off his signet ring \f + \fr 3:10 \fk signet ring- \ft The king's signet ring was used as a stamp that legitimized all documents of the king's decisions.\f* from his finger and gave it to Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite who was the mortal enemy of the Jews.
\v 11 The king said to Haman, "I give your silver back to you, and about the Jews I leave them up to you. Do what you think best toward them."
\p
\v 12 So on the 13th day of the first month, Haman called the country's secretaries to write a letter of decision addressed to every governor, district head, mayor and other officials in all the provinces. Copies of that letter mentioned were made in every language and alphabet that was used in every province. All of the copies of that letter were legitimized in the name King Ahasuerus and were sealed with the King's signet ring. After that it was sent to the entire kingdom so that everyone would know and be ready to carry it out.
\v 13 The contents of that letter were a command that all the Jews— both old and young, women and children, should be killed in one day. The day that was determined was the 13th day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar. It was also explained in that letter that the valued possessions of the Jews could be seized to belong to whoever killed them.
\p
\v 14 The copies of the letter acted as laws that must be done throughout the territory of King Ahasuerus, then they were publicized so that everyone would know and be ready to carry out the command on the day that had been appointed.
\v 15 In accord with the king's command, messengers departed quickly to deliver the letters to all the provinces of the kingdom. That command was publicized also in Susa, the capital city of Media Persia. While the people of the city of Susa were stirred up by that news, the king and Haman instead were sitting around and drinking wine.
