\v 1 The king's predefined order would begin to take effect on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. \f + \fr 9:1 \fk the thirteenth day… Adar \ft See the footnote for Esther 3:7 and 13 \f* That day was awaited by the enemies of the Jews in order to eliminate that people group. But it turns out, it was the Jews who defeated their enemies.
\v 2 In every city, in all the districts of the kingdom, Jews joined together to attack their enemies. And there was no one able to go against them, because their enemies were already afraid.
\v 3 All the governors and officers in the whole territory of King Ahasueros chose to help the Jews for fear of Mordecai.
\v 4 Mordecai's name was know by the people in general in all the districts of the kingdom because his great influence in the palace, and he was increasingly powerful.
\p
\v 5 On the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, the Jews launched an attack and killed their enemies with the sword. They even did what they wanted against the citizens who hated them.
\v 6 In the capital city of Susa alone they killed 500 people.
\v 7-9 Included among them were the ten sons of Haman named Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.
\v 10 They were the sons of Haman, grandsons of Hammedatha, the great enemy of the Jews. The Jews killed them but didn't seize their possessions.
\p
\v 11 On the last day, there were people who reported to the king the total number of people killed by the Jews in Susa.
\v 12 The king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa alone the Jews already killed 500 people including the ten sons of Haman! Moreover in other districts in the kingdom, certainly many more people were killed also. Now what else do you request? I will do it!“
\p
\v 13 Esther answered, “If Your Majesty pleases, tomorrow allow the Jews to return and do what they did in Susa today. And order that the bodies of Haman's ten sons be hung on the hanging post.“
\p
\v 14 The king agreed to Esther's request and the Jews were permitted to kill many more enemies again the next day. The bodies of the ten sons of Haman were hung.
\v 15 The next day, on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar\f + \fr 9:15 \fk the fourteenth day of the month of Adar \ft The fourteenth day in the Hebrew calendar is estimated to be the eighth of March \f*, the Jews of Susa gathered again and killed more than 300 enemies, but they didn't take their possessions.
\p
\v 16-17 On the thirteenth day of the month of Adar in all the other provinces, all of the Jews also gathered to defend themselves, and they killed 75,000 people who hated them. They did not take the possessions of the people that they killed. The next day, they just rested and held a celebration.
\v 18 In the capital city of Susa, the Jews gathered and killed their enemies on the thirteenth day and fourteenth day of the month of Adar. After that they also rested and held a celebration on the fifteenth day of the month of Adar.
\v 19 That is why every fourteenth day of the month of Adar, the Jews who live in the country now hold a celebration and give each other food to observe the event of defeating their enemies.
\p
\v 20 Mordecai wrote down all that happened. Then he wrote a letter to all of the Jews that lived in the whole kingdom of King Ahasuerus.
\v 21-22 He ordered them to hold a celebration every year on thirteenth day and the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. On those days, the Jews defeated their enemies, so that their feeling of grief changed to become a feeling of joy and gladness. Mordecai ordered the entire Jewish nation to hold a celebration with partying and giving food to each other and also to the poor people.
\p
\v 23 The Jews [even] proceded with what was ordered by Mordecai. They agreed to hold a celebration every year on the day and date that was determined.
\v 24 They also recalled how Haman, the enemy of the Jewish nation, cast lots that were called 'pur' used to determine the day of the slaughter the Jews. Haman was the son of Hammedatha from the Agagite nation.
\v 25 Then Esther took down Haman's plan and reported him to the king. Because of that the king defeated Haman's evil plan to wipe out the Jews, and instead gave the death sentence to Haman and his ten sons.
\v 26 That's why the celebration to remember the series of events is called Purim, which came from the word pur which means ‘cast lots’. Haman had cast lots to determine the day of slaughter of the Jews.
\p But because of the change caused by that official letter and because of the solution of all the threats against them,
\v 27 then all of the Jews appointed an official promise to celebrate those two days every year according to what was determined.
\v 28 The Celebration of Purim will be remembered by every family of Jews, in every village, city and province. This custom they promised to continue every year from then on—without stopping.
\p
\v 29 Then on the authority that had been given to her as queen, Esther \f + \fr 9:29 \fk Esther \ft the Hebrew text repeats information from Est. 2:15 that Esther was the “daughter of Abihail“.”\f* together with Mordecai wrote a second letter to confirm the first letter about the Holiday of Purim.
\v 30-31 The content of the second letter began with words of greeting that the Jews would always be safe and prosperous. Then that letter ordered that it still carried out the holiday of Purim on the date that was appointed and according to the order from Mordecai and Queen Ester—including regulations about the time of fasting and mourning. Copies of that second letter were sent to all the Jews that lived in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
\v 32 That was the content of Esther's orders about the Purim celebration, and those things were officially recorded.
