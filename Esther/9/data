\v 1 The king's order and carrying out of it would begin to take effect on the 7th of March. \f + \fr 9:1 \fk 7th of March \ft 7th of March can be compared to the 13th day of the second month in the month of Adar at that time.\f* That day was awaited by the enemies of the Jewish people in order to destroy that people group. But obviously, the Jewish people defeated their enemies.
\v 2 In every city, in all the districts of the kingdom, Jewish people joined together to launch an attack on their enemies. There was no one from other people groups who was bold to war against the Jewish people because of fear.
\v 3 All the governors, officers and important people in each province chose to help the Jewish people for fear of Mordecai.
\v 4 Mordecai's name was know by the people in general in all the districts of the kingdom because his great influence in the palace increased.
\p
\v 5 On the 7th of March, the Jewish people launched an attack and killed their enemies with the sword. They even did what they wanted to the citizens who hated them.
\v 6 In the capital city of Susa alone they killed 500 people.
\v 7-9 Included among them were the ten sons of Haman named Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.
\v 10 They were the sons of Haman, grandsons of Hammedatha, the great enemy of the Jewish people. The Jewish people killed them but didn't take away their possessions.
\p
\v 11 On the last day, their were people who reported to the king the total number of people killed by the Jews of Susa.
\v 12 The king said to Queen Esther, "In Susa alone the Jews killed 500 people including the ten sons of Haman! Moreover in other districts in the kingdom, certainly many more people were killed also. Now what else do you request? I will do it!"
\p
\v 13 Esther answered, "If Your Majesty pleases, tomorrow allow the Jewish people to return and do what they did in Susa today. And order that the bodies of Haman's ten sons be hung on the hanging post."
\p
\v 14 The king agreed to Esther's request and the Jewish people were permitted to kill many more enemies again the next day. The bodies of the ten sons of Haman were hanged.
\v 15 The next day, on the 8th of March the Jewish people of Susa gathered again and killed more than 300 enemies of theirs. They didn't take the possessions of the enemies.
\p
\v 16-17 On the 7th of March in all of the other provinces, all of the Jewish people also gathered to defend themselves, and they killed 75,000 people who hated them. The next day they just rested and held a celebration.
\v 18 In the capital city of Susa, the Jewish people gathere and killed their enemies on the 7th and 8th of March. After that they just rested and rested? also with holding a celebration on the 9th of March.
\v 19 That's why every year on the 8th of March, the Jewish people who live in the villages now hold a celebration and give each other gifts of food to remember the event of defeating their enemies.
\p
\v 20 Mordecais wrote down all that happened. Then he wrote a letter to all of the Jews that lived in the whole kingdom of King Ahasuerus.
\v 21-22 He ordered them to hold a celebration every year on the 8th and 9th of March. On those days, the Jewish people's fate changed and defeated their enemies, so that their feeling of grief changed to become a feeling of joy and gladness. Mordecai ordered all of the Jewish people to hold a celebration with feasting and giving each other gifts of food to their fellowman and also to the poor people.
\p
\v 23 The Jewish people [even] agreed to do what was ordered by Mordecai. They were agreed to hold a celebration every year on the day and date that was determined.
\v 24 They also remembered how Haman the son of Hammedatha, descendant of King Agag, enemy of all Jewish people cas lots that were called "pur" used to determine the day to slaughter the Jewish people.
\v 25 At that celebration, they would remember how Esther took down Haman's plan and reported him to the king. Also how the king defeated Haman's evil plan to wipe out the Jewish people, and instead Haman and his ten sons were hanged.
\v 26 That's why the celebration to remember the chain of events is called Purim, which came from the word pur, which meant 'cast lots'. Haman used lots to determine the day of slaughter of the Jewish people.
\p But because of the change caused by that official letter and because of the solution of all the threats against them,
\v 27 then all of the Jewish people appointed an official promise to celebrate those two days every year according to what was appointed.
\v 28 The celebration of Purim will be remembered by every family of Jewish people in every village, city and province. This tradition they promised to continue every year from then on—without stopping.
\p
\v 29 Then according to the entitlement given to her as the queen, Esther \f + \fr 9:29 \fk Esther \ft the Hebrew text repeats information from Est. 2:15 that Esther was the "daughter of Abihail".”\f* together with Mordecai signed a second letter to clarify the first letter about the Holiday of Purim.
\v 30-31 The contents of the second letter began with words of greeting so that the Jewish people would always be safe and prosperous. Then that letter ordered so that the holiday of Purim would always be carried out on the date that was appointed and according to the order from Mordecai and Queen Ester—including regulations about the time of fasting and wearing sackcloth. Copies of that second letter were sent to all the Jewish people in 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus.
\v 32 In that way the letter of order of Esther's about the rules of the holiday of Purim were also written in an official way in the history book of the kingdom of Persia.
