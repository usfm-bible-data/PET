\s1 Esther invites Haman and the king to a very special dinner party
\p
\v 1 The day after Esther ordered so that all of the Jews fast, Esther prepared a very special dinner, then she wore her special queen's robe and entered the yard of the king's palace— which was the yard facing the room where the king sat on his throne.
\v 2 When the king saw Esther standing in the yard, the king was happy and immediately held out his golden scepter in her direction as a sign that Esther could approach him. Then Esther came close and touched the scepter.
\p
\v 3 Then the king said to her, "Esther, what do you want? Tell me, and I will give it to you— even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!"
\p
\v 4 Esther answere, "Glorious majesty, if it pleases, come with Haman to the very special dinner party that I have prepared for the two of you!"
\p
\v 5 The king said to his servants, "Go and tell Haman so that he comes to the dinner party that has been prepared by Esther especially for the two of us!" Then the king and Haman went to the place where the food had been prepared.
\p
\v 6 While they were drinking wine, then the king said to Esther, tell me what you really want. I will give it to you— even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!"
\p
\v 7-8 Esther answered, "If you Majesty is happy and ready to give me what I ask, I ask that you come again tomorrow to the dinner party that I will prepare especially for you two. At that time I will tell you what I really want."

\s1 Haman plans to kill Mordecai
\p
\v 9 Haman felt very blessed when he left the dinner party. But when he saw Mordecai didn't stand to give him honor, Haman became very angry.
\v 10 However at that time Haman didn't show that he was angry. He just went home, then called Zeresh— who was his wife, and his friends.
\v 11 Then to them Haman bragged about himself about his wealth, about his sons who were many, and that he was greatly honored over all the workers and members of the king's family.
\v 12 In fact, Haman even added, "And not just that! Queen Esther invided just the two of us— the king and I, to come to a dinner party that she prepared today. And she invited just us two again to another dinner party tomorrow!"
\v 13 Then Haman said, "But all of that means nothing to me as long as I see Mordecai— that Jew, sitting in the gate of the palace and ignoring me!"
\p
\v 14 After that Haman's wife, Zeresh and all of his close friends suggested, "Order your workers to make a hanging post 75 meters tall to hang Mordecai. Then tomorrow ask the king's permission to hang Mordecai on that post. After that, with a happy heart you will party with the king." Haman was happy with that idea, then he ordered his workers to put up the hanging post.
