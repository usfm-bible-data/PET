\s1 Esther invites king Ahasueros and Haman to a very special dinner party
\p
\v 1 On the third day while the Jews in the city of Susa were fasting, Esther wore a queen's robe, then she entered the special hall of the king's palace.
\v 2 When the king saw Esther standing in that special hall, the king was happy and immediately held out his golden scepter in her direction as a sign that Esther could approach. Then Esther came close and touched the tip of the scepter.
\p
\v 3 The king asked her, “Esther, what do you want? Tell me, and I will give it to you— even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!“
\p
\v 4 Esther answered, “My lord the King, if it pleases, come with Haman to the very special dinner party that I have prepared for both my lords tonight!“
\p
\v 5 The king said to his servants, “Go and tell Haman so that soon he comes to the dinner party that is already prepared by Esther especially for the two of us!“ Then the king with Haman came to the place where the food had been prepared.
\p
\v 6 While they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Tell me what you want. I will give it to you— even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!“
\p
\v 7-8 Esther answered, “If my lord the King is pleased and ready to give me what I ask, I ask that you come again tomorrow to the dinner party that I will prepare especially for both my lords. At that time I will tell you what I really want.“

\s1 Haman plans to kill Mordecai
\p
\v 9 Haman’s heart was cheerful when he left that special dinner party. But when he saw Mordecai at the palace gate not stand or bow to give him honor, he was very angry.
\v 10 However at that time Haman didn't show that he was angry. He just went home, then called Zeresh— his wife, and his friends.
\v 11 Then Haman bragged about himself in front of them about his wealth, about his sons who were many, and that he was greatly praised over all the officials and all the nobility.
\v 12 In fact, Haman even added, “And not just that! Queen Esther invited just us two— the king and I, to come to a special dinner party that she prepared tonight. And she invited just us two again to a second dinner party tomorrow!
\v 13 But all of that means nothing to me as long as I still see Mordecai— that Jew, sitting at the gate of the king's palace!“
\p
\v 14 After that Haman's wife, Zeresh and all of his close friends suggested, “Order your servants to set up a hanging post about 22 meters high to hang Mordecai. Then tomorrow morning ask permission from the king to hang Mordecai on that post. After that, with a cheerful heart you will go to the special dinner party with the king.“ Haman was happy with that idea, then he ordered his servants to set up the hanging post.
