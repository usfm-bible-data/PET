\s1 Haman is sentenced to die
\p
\v 1 Then King Ahasuerus and Haman went to the special dinner party for the second time that had been prepared by Queen Ester.
\v 2 While they were drinking wine, the king asked Esther again, "Esther, what do you want me to do for you? Tell me, and I will do it for you— even if you ask me for half of my kingdom, I will give it to you!"
\p
\v 3 Esther answered, "Yes Majestic King, if it pleases, and you want to do what I ask, save me and my people! That is what I want Majestic King to do for me!
\v 4 We— I and my people along with the herds have been as if sold to a person who wants to kill us. If we were sold to become slaves, I wouldn't say anything, because that wouldn't be important enough to bother Majestic King."
\p
\v5 Then the king asked \f + \fr 7:1 \fk king's name \ft The name Ahasuerus in this verse was moved to verse 5:1. To be natural, the name Esther isn't repeated here.\f* Who is so bold as to do that? Where is that person?"
\p
\v 6 Esther answered, "Evil Haman is our enemy!"
\p Upon hearing that Haman looked at them with great fear.
\v 7 The king was very angry, the got up leaving the table and immediately went outside to the palace garden. While Haman stayed to request Queen Esther to save his life because he knew that he would be sentenced to die.
\v 8 At the very moment the king came in again, Haman had just knelt next to Esther to request with pleading of her. He put his face and hands on the couch where Esther lay.
\p Upon seeing Haman fall like that, the king shouted, "What! It's as though he entered my house and wants to rape the queen in front of me!" After the king said that, Esters servants came and covered Haman's head. That showed that Haman would certainly soon be put to death.
\p
\v 9 Then, Harbona— the special servant, said to the king, "Close to Haman's house there is a hanging post 75 feet high. Haman put it up to hang Mordecai on it—that is the man who saved the live of my Master the King!"
\p The king said, "Hang him on that post!"
\v 10 In that way Haman was hung on the post that he put up to hang Mordecai! After that the king's anger subsided.
