\s1 Esther becomes the new queen
\p
\v 1 About three years later, King Ahasuerus was no longer angry, he remembered Vashti and about the laws and decision that he had made about Vashti.
\v 2 Then one of his personal attendants said, "Your Majesty, it would be best if your Majesty sent several workers of the kingdom to go to all of the districts of the kingdom to look for and find beautiful virgins for your Majesty.
\v 3 After they gather several virgins, let Your Majesty appoint several workers in each province to bring them to the women's palace in Susa. Then Hegai, the head of the household of the women's palace will be responsible for the beauty care of those virgins.
\v 4 Then the virgin who most entices the heart of Your Majesty will become the replacement for Queen Vashti." The king really liked this suggestion and did what was suggested to him.
\p
\v 5 At that time, there was a Jewish descendant of Shimei, the son of Jair named Mordecai who lived in the capital city Susa. Shimei was a descendant of Kish, who was the father of King Saul. They were from the line of descendants of the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 6 King Nebucadnezar had brought and held captive Mordecai's family years before that from Jerusalem to Babylon, together with King Jehoiachin of Judah and the other captives.
\v 7 Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah that in the Babylonian language she was named Ester. Her face was beautiful and her body was captivating. After her two parents died, Mordecai took care of Esther like his own child.
\p
\v 8 After the king gave the order, then the workers of the kingdom looked for several beautiful virgins. Workers from every province that brought Esther and the other virgins to the king's palace. The king positioned Hegai as the one responsible over them.
\v 9 Hegai was very happy with Esther, and he treated Esther well. He arranged for all of Esther's needs from food to beauty care. He ordered seven servant girls from the king's palace to take charge of Esther and placed them in the best rooms in the women's palace.
\p
\v 10 Esther didn't tell anyone that she was a Jew, because Mordecai had told her not to tell anyone.
\v 11 Everyday Mordecai walked near the garden of the women's palace where the virgins were kept temporarily. In order to find out what happened to Esther, he asked the people who entered the palace.
\p
\v 12 For as long as one year the virgins had to under go beauty care to make themselves more beautiful before being brought to the king. For the first six months they had to undergo special care of olive oil with mixture of myrrh that was rubbed on their bodies everyday. For the next six months they underwent care with various collections of spices and perfumes that were rubbed on their bodies.
\v 13 Then, if one of the virgins was called before the king, she was allowed to wear clothing and adornments of her choice.
\v 14 In the evening, the virgin was taken to the king's private room. The next day she was brought back to the place where the women who had had sex with the king lived. A worker named Shaashgaz had responsibility over those women, and would live there the rest of their lives. If the king wanted a woman to return, he would tell Shaashgaz the name of that woman.
\p
\v 15- 16 In the seventh year of King Ahasuerus' government, the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai to appear before the king. Esther was adopted by Mordecai as a child. The servants brought Esther to the king in the middle of winter. Esther wore clothing and adornments according to Hegai's suggestions. Everyone who saw Esther liked her.
\p
\v 17 The king like Esther better than the other women whom they brought to him. He really liked Esther and placed the crown on her head that had been worn by Vashti. The king announced that Esther would become queen in place of Vashti.
\v 18 The king held a great feast for Esther and invite all of his officials and servants. With generosity the king gave gifts to everyone. He established the time of the celebration mentioned as a holiday in all of the districts of his authority, and for that length of time payment of taxes was released.
\p
\v 19 Time passed, all of the women who had not had sex with the king gathered together again. At that time, Mordecai was appointed to become a palace official and was at the door of the king's gate.
\v 20 Esther still had not told that she was a Jew because she obeyed Mordecai like when Mordecai raised her.
\p
\v 21 One day when Mordecai was doing his work at the palace, two of the kings guards were there. The two were named Bigthan and Teresh who had duties as guards outside the king's private room. They held a grudge against the king so planned to kill him.
\v 22 Their plan became known to Mordecai, then he reported it to Queen Esther. Esther quickly told the king what Mordecai had reported.
\v 23 The king looked into what Mordecai reported and it was true. The king ordered the two people to be punished by hanging. After the punishment was carried out, that event was written in the book titled: The history book of what happened in the era of Raja Ahasuerus' government.
