\s1 Esther becomes the new queen
\p
\v 1 Some time later, King Ahasuerus was no longer angry, he remembered what Vashti had done and about his decision about her.
\v 2 Then one of his personal attendants said, “It would be best if your Majesty sent several workers of the kingdom to all of the districts of the kingdom, to get beautiful young ladies for your Majesty.
\v 3 After they gather some young ladies, let Your Majesty appoint several workers in each province to bring them here to the quarters in the palace for the wives of the king. Then Hegai—the king’s special servant, who’s duty as head of household of the quarters for the king's wives will be responsible for the beauty care of those virgins.
\v 4 Then the young lady who most entices the heart of Your Majesty will become the replacement for Queen Vashti.” The king liked this suggestion, then he did just that.
\p
\v 5 At that time, there was a Jew that lived in the capital city Susa named Mordecai. He was th,e son of Jair. And Jair was the son of Shimei, and Shimei was the son of Kish of the tribe of Benjamin.
\v 6 Many years before this story, King Nebucadnezar had made captives of Mordecai's family and brought them from Jerusalem to Babylon— together with King Jehoiachin\f + \fr 2:6 \fk Jehoiachin \ft Literally, ‘Jeconiah’— which is another name for Jehoiachin. Like several other translations, TSI uses the name normally used in the OT for Jehoiachin. This is done so that readers are not confused by the different name.\f* of the tribe of Judah and the other captives.
\v 7 Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah who was also called Ester. Her face was beautiful and her body was captivating. After her two parents died, Mordecai took care of Esther like his own child.
\p
\v 8 After the king gave the order, then the workers of the kingdom went to look for some beautiful young ladies in every province. Then the appointed officer from each province brought the young ladies to the king's palace— including Esther. The king placed Hegai as the one responsible over them.
\v 9 Hegai was very happy with Esther, so he gave priority to Esther. Right away he arranged for all of Esther's needs from food to beauty care. He ordered seven servant girls from the king's palace to attend to Esther and placed them in the best rooms in the women's palace.
\p
\v 10 Esther didn't tell anyone that she was a Jew, because Mordecai had told her not to tell anyone.
\v 11 Everyday Mordecai walked near the garden of the women's palace I to find out what happened to Esther, and he often asked the people who came in and out of the palace.
\p
\v 12 According to the regulations, the young ladies had to undergo beauty care for one year before being brought to the king. For the first six months, they had to undergo special treatment of olive oil with a mixture of myrrh oil that was rubbed on their bodies everyday, and the next six months they underwent care with various collections of spices and perfumes that were rubbed on their bodies.
\v 13 When one of the young ladies was called before the king, she was allowed to put on clothing and adornments of her choice.
\v 14 In the evening, the young lady would be taken to the king's private room. The next day, she would be brought to the residence of the women who already had sex with the king. A special servant named Shaashgaz had responsibility over those women. If the king wanted a woman to come back again, the king would convey this to Shaashgaz by naming that woman.
\p
\v 15-16 In the seventh year of King Ahasuerus' government, the turn came for Esther the daughter of Abihail— the uncle of Mordecai, to appear before the king. Esther was adopted by Mordecai as a child. The servants brought Esther to the king in the month of Tebet.\f + \fr 3:7 \fk month of Tebet \ft The month of Tebet is the tenth month in the Jewish calendar. In the modern calendar, the month of Tebet extends from around the middle of December to mid-January.\f* Esther wore clothing and jewelry according to Hegai's suggestions. Everyone who saw Esther liked her.
\p
\v 17 The king liked Esther more than the other women whom they brought to him. He really loved Esther and placed the crown on her head that had been worn by Vashti. The king announced that Esther would become queen in place of Vashti.
\v 18 The king held a great feast for Esther and invited all of his dignitaries and nobles. With generosity the king gave gifts to everyone. He established the time of that celebration as a holiday in all of the districts of his authority.
\p
\v 19 Time passed, all of the women who had not had sex with the king gathered together again. At that time, Mordecai was already appointed to become a palace official. Therefore, he often served at the gate of the king's palace.
\v 20 Esther still had not told that she was a Jew because she obeyed Mordecai like when Mordecai raised her.
\p
\v 21 One day when Mordecai was doing his work at the palace, two of the kings guards were there. The two were named Bigthan and Teresh who had duties as guards outside the king's private room. They held a grudge against the king so planned to kill him.
\v 22 Their plan became known to Mordecai, then he reported it to Queen Esther. Then Esther told the king that Mordecai had heard planned murder.
\v 23 The king looked into what Mordecai reported and it was true. So the king ordered the two people to be punished by hanging. That event was written in the history book of the era of King Ahasuerus' reign.
