\s1 The king of Persia divorces his queen
\p
\v 1-2 When King Ahasuerus ruled over the kingdom of Persia— whose capital city was Susa, the area of his authority was very broad consisting of 127 provinces from India to Ethiopia.
\v 3 In the third year of the era of his government, Raja Ahasuerus held a great celebration. He invited all of the officials, army generals from Persia and Media, along with the governors and high provincial officials and all of his employees to attend that feast.
\v 4 That huge celebration lasted six months. During that celebration feast, the king displayed to his invited guests all of his riches, to show how great and grand, impressive and glorious was his kingdom.
\p
\v 5 At the end of the sixth month, the king held another feast for all of the people of Susa. That feast was held in the garden of the king's palace for one full week. The invited guests consisted of all the palace workers, both important and ordinary people.
\v 6 The garden that was in the palace was decorated withcurtains of white cotton and cloth that was hung colored purple from silver pipes and tied with white and purple linen cords that were attached to pillars made from expensive white stone \f + \fr 1:6 \fk white stone … \ft The name of the white stone is marble.\f*. The seats for the guests were like couches \f + \fr 1:6 \fk seats of the guests were like couches \ft that were shaped like long, low benches so that the guests could eat while reclining.\f* made of gold and silver. The couches mentioned were placed on top of the floor whose surface was decorated with small pieces of various gem stones, mother of pearl and expensive white stone, and all of it was arranged orderly.
\p
\v 7 The guests drank wine from various luxurious drinking vessels that were made of gold.
\v 8 The availability of wine was abundant because the king wanted every guest to be able to drink without limit and guests weren't forced to drink if they didn't want to. The king gave the command to the palace servants so that every guest was served according to each one's desires.
\p
\v 9 At the same time, Queen Vashti also invited the palace officials' wives to feast in a different room at the palace of King Ahasuerus.
\p
\v 10 On the last day of that feast, when King Ahasuerus had drunk wine until his heart was happy and he was getting drunk, he called seven special palace servants \f + \fr 1:10 \fk special servants \ft Literally, “eunuchs”— who were a group of palace workers that had been castrated and became managers of things connected with the queen and the kings concubines.\f*— who were: Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas.
\v 11 The king ordered them to bring Queen Vashti into his presence wearing the crown of the kingdom. The king wanted to display the beauty of his wife to his invited guests, because Queen Vashti was really beautiful.
\p
\v 12 But when the servants conveyed the king's order to Queen Vashti, she refused to come before the king. \f + \fr 1:12 \fk refused \ft Obviously Vashti didn't want to show off her beauty to a group of men who were half drunk.\f* This made the king very angry.
\v 13-14 On hearing Vashti's answer, the king immediately asked the advice of the seven top advisors of his kingdom. They were: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Merses, Marsena and Memucan. The king often asked their advice, because those seven officials were experts in problems of law and of the culture of Persia and Media.
\p
\v 15 The king said, "According to the law, what action do we have to take against Queen Vashti? I have sent my servants to her to order her to come to me. But she didn't obey my order."
\p
\v 16 One of the king's advisers named Memucan said, "Your Highness, Queen Vashti didn't just do wrong to your Majesty, but she also did wrong to all the officials— in fact to all the men in your kingdom!
\v 17 All of the women in the whole kingdom will hear what was done by Queen Vashti, and they will say, "The king ordered Queen Vashti to come to him, but she refused.' And they will use it as an excuse to not obey their own husbands.
\v 18 Before the end of this day, when wives of all the officials of Persia and Media will hear about what the queen did, they will also refuse to obey their husbands. They won't respect their husbands and that thing will make all the husbands very angry.
\v 19 If it pleases your Majesty, let a written order go out that will be includiedin the laws of Persia and Media so that it can't be erased. Write that Queen Vashti can't approach your Majesty again. Let your Majesty surrender the status of queen to another woman who is better than she.
\v 20 If so, when hearing what your Majesty has ordered, then all the wives both of the officials and of ordinary people will honor and obey their husbands."
\p
\v 21-22 The king and his other officials agreed with the suggestion of Memucan. And the king ordered that that letter of command be written and sent to all the provinces in every language and script that was used by the residents in all areas of his kingdom. That letter of command clarified that all men have full authority over their own households and and can use the language of their own place of origin.
