\s1 The disobedience of Queen Vashti
\p
\v 1 This is what happened when King Ahasuerus ruled over the kingdom of Media Persia. The area of his authority was very broad consisting of 127 provinces — from India to Ethiopia.
\v 2 Ahasuerus ruled from his palace — that was surrounded by battlements— in the city of Susa.
\v 3 In the third year of the era of his reign, King Ahasuerus held a great celebration for all of the officials— including the army generals of Media-Persia, the princes and the governors.
\v 4 That huge celebration lasted six months, and while that celebration feast was going, the king displayed to all his invited guests all of his riches, to show how great and grand, impressive and glorious was his kingdom.
\p
\v 5 At the end of the sixth month, the king held another feast for all of the workers of the palace, both important and ordinary people. That feast was held in the garden of the king's palace for one full week.
\v 6 The garden that was in the palace was decorated with white linen that was hung to look like the ceiling. Some fabric colored purple also was hung from circlets of silver — circlets that were paired to pillars made from expensive white stone \f + \fr 1:6 \fk white stone … \ft The name of the white stone is marble.\f*and tied using a ribbon purple linen. The seats for the guests were like couches \f + \fr 1:6 \fk seats of the guests were like couches \ft that were shaped like long, low benches so that the guests could eat while reclining.\f*— made of gold and silver, placed on top of the floor whose surface was decorated with small pieces of various gem stones, mother of pearl\f + \fr 5:15-16 \fk mother of pearl \ft That is the inner part of the shell of the oysters.\f* and expensive white stone, and all of it was arranged orderly.
\p
\v 7-8 The guests drank wine from various luxurious drinking vessels that were made of gold. The availability of wine was abundant because the king wanted every guest to be able to drink without limit and guests weren't forced to drink if they didn't want to. Because before the king gave the command to the palace servants, so that every guest was served according to each one's desires.
\p
\v 9 At the same time, Queen Vashti also invited the palace officials' wives to feast in a different room at the palace of King Ahasuerus.
\p
\v 10 On the last day of that feast, when King Ahasuerus had drunk wine until his heart was happy and he was getting drunk, he called seven special palace servants \f + \fr 1:10 \fk special servants \ft Literally, “eunuchs”— who were a group of palace workers that had been castrated and became managers of things connected with the queen and the kings concubines.\f*— who were: Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas.
\v 11 The king ordered them to bring Queen Vashti into his presence wearing the crown of the kingdom. The king wanted to display the beauty of his wife to his invited guests, because Queen Vashti was really beautiful.
\p
\v 12 But when the servants conveyed the king's order to Queen Vashti, she refused to come before the king. \f + \fr 1:12 \fk refused \ft It is likely that Vashti didn't want to show off her beauty to a group of men who were getting drunk.\f* This made the king very angry.
\v 13-14 On hearing Vashti's answer, the king immediately asked the advice of the seven top advisors of his kingdom. They were: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Merses, Marsena and Memucan. The king often asked their advice, because those seven officials were experts in problems of the law and the culture.
\p
\v 15 The king said, "According to the law, what action do we have to take against Queen Vashti? I have sent my servants to her to order her to come to me. But she didn't obey my order."
\p
\v 16 One of the king's advisers named Memucan said, "Your Highness, Queen Vashti didn't just do wrong to your Majesty, but she also did wrong to all the officials— in fact to all the men in your kingdom!
\v 17 All of the women in the whole kingdom will hear what was done by Queen Vashti, and they will say, "The king ordered Queen Vashti to come to him, but she refused.' And they will use it as an excuse to not obey their own husbands.
\v 18 Before the end of this day, when the wives hear about what the queen did, they will also refuse to submit to their husbands, and they won't respect their husbands anymore. So that will make all the husbands very angry.
\v 19 If it pleases your Majesty, issue a written order that Queen Vashti can not come before the king again, and that written order will be includied in the laws of Media Persia so that it can't be erased. Then your Majesty the king hand over the position of queen to another woman who is more worthy than she.
\v 20 Therefore, when your Majesty the King’s order is announced, then all the wives, both of the officials and of ordinary people, will honor and obey their husbands."
\p
\v 21 The king and the other officials agreed with Memucan’s proposal.
\v 22 Then the king ordered so that that letter of command be written and sent to all the provinses in every language and script that was used by the residents in all areas of his kingdom. That letter of command declared that all husbands have full authority to manage everything in their own households, and the husband’s tribe language, must become the language that is used in their family.
