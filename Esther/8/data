\s1 The king sends out his decision to save the Jews
\p
\v 1 That day also, Raja Ahasuerus surrendered to Esther all of the possessions of Haman— the great enemy of the Jew's. Esther told the king that Mordecai was her cousin. When the king heard that, he sent news so Mordecai come to face him.
\v 2 When Mordecai approached, the king released and gave the nation's ring— the ring he had previously given to Haman, to Mordecai. Esther raised up Mordecai to manage all of Haman's possessions.
\v 3  Esther approached the king again. While crying, she bowed and asked the king to cancel the evil plan to kill all of the Jews that Haman had made.
\v 4 The king stretched out his golden scepter to Esther, so Esther got up and said,
\v 5 "If Your Majesty is pleased and thinks it right, and your servant has the generosity of the king— your servant asks to put out a letter of order to rescind and cancel the letter of order of Haman— that is the death sentence for all descendants of Jews in every province in all the district of your kingdom.
\v 6 Your servant doesn't have the heart to see your servant's whole people group and relatives killed."
\p
\v 7 King Ahasuerus answered Queen Esther and Mordecai, "Because Haman ? appeared to get rid of all of the Jewish people, I will surrender to you, Esther, all of Haman's possessions, and I ordered the soldiers to put to death Haman by hanging.
\v 8 So now write a letter to save your people group. Include your name in those letters, and use my ring to legalize that letter of decision, because that letter that my name and my stamp are added to can not be changed forever."
\p
\v 9 So on that day too, the 25th of June, the King called his secretaries/writing experts, and Mordecai ordered them to write a letter to every Jewish citizen and to all the governors and other officers in 127 provinces, from as far as India in the eastern district to Ethiopia in the western district. The writing experts wrote all the letters in the language and alphabet used in each district. They even wrote the letters directed to the Jewish people in the Jewish language.
\v 10-11 Those letters were written in the name of King Ahasuerus who permitted the Jewish people in each city to join together and defend themselves. They were also permitted to kill the soldiers or anyone who attacked, they alos were permitted to take the possessions and kill the women and children of the attackers.
\v 12-13 Mordecai signed those letters in the name of the King and added the stamp of the kingdom. Then he ordered the messengers to take the letters to all corners of the kingdom riding horses that could run as quickly as possible that were specially raised for kingdom business. Copies of that letter of order went out as laws and were announced in every province to be known that the Jewish people were ready to oppose their enemies on the 7th of March the following year, which was the day the previously had been appointed by Haman to kill the Jewish people.
\v 14 The messengers quickly left taking the letter of order to every province riding horses owned by the king that could run quickly. In Susa, a copy of the same letter was also read to all of the citizens of the capital city.
\p
\v 15 Mordecai then left the palace, wearing grand kingdom clothing gift of the king colored blue and white, fine linen robe colored purple and a very beautiful crown of gold. The citizens of the capital city of Susa shouted full of joy when hearing the new laws.
\v 16-17 All of the Jewish citizens of Susa beamed showing their joy and feeling of pride. That also happened in every city and province, Jewish people celebrated joyfully with parties when the laws just mentioned were announced. Other citizens that were circumcised to identify themselves as part of the Jewish people group, because they were afraid what would fall on them if they didn't do that.
