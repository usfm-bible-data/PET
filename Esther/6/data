\s1 The king honors Mordecai
\p
\v 1 That night, the king couldn't sleep. Because of that he ordered one of his servants to bring the written history and read about what had happend since he became king.
\v 2 The servant read about Bigthana and Teresh, the two entrance door guards to the king's room. Mordecai knew the two of them planned to kill the king, and Mordecai told that to the king.
\p
\v 3 The king asked his servants, "What honor did we give to Mordecai in return for his service in this situation?"
\p The servants answered, "We haven't yet given anything to him."
\p
\v 4 Then the king asked, "Is there an official in the palace area?" And it happened at that moment, Haman entered the yard of the palace to ask that Mordecai be hanged on the hanging post that he had just raised.
\p
\v 5 The servants answered, "Haman is coming, in the yard."
\p And the king said, "Invite him to enter!"
\v 6 When Haman entered, the king asked him, "There is a person I want to give great honor to. What would be the best I do for him?"
\p Haman thought, "Who else would be given such a great honor by the king? Me for sure!"
\v 7 So Haman answered, "If there is someone who Majestic King wants to give great honor,
\v 8 let him be brought grand clothing that has been worn by my Lord the king, and a horse that the King has riddenâ€” which is decorated with a symbol of the kingdom on his head.
\v 9 Then ask a high official of the country of the nobility to put the clothing on that person whom Your Majesty honors, then take that person on procession riding Your Majesties horse around the city center. The official will walk in front of him while crying out, "This is how the king values the person who is honored by him!"
\p
\v 10 The king answered Haman, "Great! Quickly take clothing and that horse and give all that honor to Mordecai, the Jew. Do what you just said, without leaving out anything. Mordecai can be found sitting in front of the palace gate."
\p
\v 11 Haman quickly did what was told by the king. He took the clothing, put it on Mordecai. Then took him on procession with riding the king's own horse aroundd the city center. Haman walked in front of Mordecai while crying out, "This is how the king gives value to the person who is honored by him!"
\v 12 After finishing the procession, Mordecai returned to sitting in the gate of the palace. Haman quickly went home, while covering his face because he felt very ashamed and truly not valued.
\p
\v 13 To his wife and friends, Haman told what he had experienced. Then his wife and friends said to him, "You've begun defeat strongly with Mordecai. He is a Jew and you can't oppose him. He will certainly defeat you."
\p
\v 14 While they were talking, some of the king's officials came to pick up Haman to go quickly to the dinner feast that had been prepared by Esther.
