\s1 Mordecai asks Esther for help
\p
\v 1 When Mordecai knew the contents of the letter ordered by Haman, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth\f + \fr 4:1 \fk sackcloth \ft The Jewish people did not have special clothes for mourning. In that time they used already-used sackcloth, from normal bags that were usually used daily for for storing wheat or barley. The pattern of the fibres in sackcloth were very rough and made the skin itch. In addition to wearing sackcloth as clothes, another custom was to spread out sacks, sprinkle ashes on them, and lay down there.\f* and put ashes on his head as a sign of mourning. He walked to the city while wailing.
\v 2 Mordecai stopped in front of the gate of the palace, because people wearing sackcloth as clothes were forbidden to enter.
\v 3 When the letter of the king's order was published in every province, the Jews showed their sadness by crying, wailing and fasting. As a sign of mourning, many of them stretched out sackcloth on the ground, sprinkled ashes on top of it, then laid there.
\p
\v 4 When the female servants and Esther’s special servants \f + \fr 4:4 \fk Esther’s special servants \ft See the note in Est. 1:10.\f* came and told her about Mordecai, Esther's heart was very sad. Esther then sent clothing to Mordecai so that he would take off the sackcloth, but Mordecai refused.
\v 5 Then Esther called Hathach— who was assigned especially by the king to serve Esther, and ordered him to meet and seek and find out from Mordecai why he was mourning.
\v 6 Then Hathach went to seek Mordecai who was in the town square that was in front of the palace gate.
\p
\v 7 Mordecai told all that had happened. He also told about the 340,000 kilograms of silver that Haman promised to put in the royal treasury if the king was willing to give orders to destroy of all the Jews.
\v 8 Mordecai also gave a copy of the king's order that was issued in Susa— whose contents revealed that all of the Jews would be wiped out. Mordecai asked Hathach to show it and explain the letter to Esther and command her to appear before and beg the king’s mercy over her people.
\v 9 So Hathach returned to Esther and reported to her everything that had been told by Mordecai.
\p
\v 10 Then Esther ordered Hathach to return to Mordecai and deliver this message,
\v 11 “All of the national officials along with the people in all the districts of the kingdom know the regulations of the kingdom that say that whoever wants to meet the king without an invitation will be sentenced to death— unless if the king holds out his golden scepter to that person. Whereas for I myself the last time I received the king's invitation was more than a month ago.“
\v 12 So Hathach returned and delivered Esther's message to Mordecai.
\p
\v 13 Mordecai reminded Esther through Hathach, “Don't think that you will be safer compared to all of the other Jews just because you live in the palace!
\v 14 If you at this time remain quiet, help and deliverance of the Jews will come from another place and you and your family will be killed. It just may be you were placed as queen in the kingdom to save our people?“
\p
\v 15 Then Esther delivered a message through Hathach to Mordecai,
\v 16 “Gather all of our people who are in Susa to fast that is not eating or drinking anything for three days. I and the women workers will also fast. After that I will face the king even though it breaks the law . If I have to die because of that, let me die!“
\v 17 Then Mordecai went and carried out Esther's message.
