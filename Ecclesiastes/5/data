\c 5
\s1 Don’t be like a hard-headed person
\p
\v 1 When going to God's House, pay close attention to what you are doing. Do not do like fools, who offer a sacrifice without thinking of its meaning.\f + \fk 5:1 \fr the wrong committed by fools \ft In this sentence, the phrase ‘without thinking of its meaning’ is implicit information that has been made explicit by the translation team, so that the reader can understand how a fool could do wrong in offering a sacrifice to the LORD. This interpretation is supported by the UBS Handbook.\f* In that way without being aware of it they commit evil again. It's better to hear a teaching in the House of God, rather than making a sacrifice like a fool.
\v 2 Don't carelessly make an oath to God to do something. Because God is in heaven and you are on earth. So let your prayer just be brief.
\p
\v 3 If you have more problems and anxieties, you will be more disturbed by nightmares. The more you talk, the more you will say words that are useless and unreasonable/nonsensical.
\p
\v 4 God does not like the oaths of fools. So if you swear that you will make an offerings to God, do not delay doing it. Keep that oath of yours!
\v 5 It is better that you not swear to give it than to swear in front of God's house officer but do not do it.
\v 6 Do not sin with your mouth!— so that when the officer of God's house comes to take that offering which you promised, you deny your oath by saying, “Sorry, my speech was wrong. I didn't mean to make that promise.” [Don't let (it happen that)//Heaven forbid] God gets angry at you and destroys all the results of your efforts.
\p
\v 7 It is better to fear and respect God than to repeatedly make vows to Him carelessly. Because just like having many dreams has no meaning, likewise much [talk//babbling] has no usefulness.
\s1 There's no meaning to having wealth either
\p
\v 8 Don't be surprised if you see officials oppressing their people, depriving them of their rights, and not making fair decisions. That happens because each official who does that has an agreement with his superior, and both have an agreement also with the superior of even higher rank.
\v 9 Thus the people were always pressured to pay additional taxes to various levels of officials, until finally the king gets his share.
\p
\v 10 If you love money and try to pile up your wealth, you will never be satisfied with what you have. This is also a futile effort.
\v 11 If you get richer, increasingly many people will join you in spending your wealth. Finally there is no benefit to being rich except every day watching your wealth disappear.
\p
\v 12 A person who works hard throughout the day can sleep soundly— no matter if he eats little or much. But the rich cannot sleep well because they continually feel anxious about their wealth.
\p
\v 13 There is another sad thing I have seen in this world: People succeed in accumulating wealth, but that wealth only brings misfortune and misery to him.
\v 14 Suddenly everything is gone, until he has nothing left to pass on to his child.
\v 15 As we were born naked, so we will not carry (away) any treasure at all when leaving this world and entering Sheol.
\p
\v 16 This is truly sad: As we come into this world, so too we leave this world! There is no profit! Isn't that like someone trying to catch the wind?!
\v 17 As long as we live in this world, we only experience unfortune, hardship, various illnesses, and [persistent anger//sick hearts]. [[The Indonesian idiom 'sick heart' is not the same 'heartache' in English. It is an anger or resentment built up over time.]
\p
\v 18 Because of all this, here are my conclusion and advice: It is better for us to eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of our hard work, because that is the reward/pay that God has given us during (our) temporary life in this world.
\v 19 Besides that, if God entrusts (us with) various possessions and fields for us to own, then if He allows us to enjoy all that, that is a great blessing from Him. If that happens to you, enjoy it!
\v 20 If God blesses us like that and we can enjoy this life, maybe we won't be bothered by the realization that life is too short!
