\c 5
\s1 Don’t be like a hard-headed person
\p
\v 1 When going to God's House, pay close attention to what you are doing. Do not do like fools, who offer a sacrifice without thinking of its meaning.\f + \fr 5:1 \fk without thinking of its meaning \ft In this sentence, the phrase ‘without thinking of its meaning’ is implicit information that has been made explicit by the translation team, so that the reader can understand how a fool could do wrong in offering a sacrifice to the LORD. (See 1Sam. 15:22.)\f* In that way without being aware of it they commit evil again. It's better to hear a teaching in the House of God, rather than making a sacrifice like a fool.
\v 2 Don't be carried away by emotions so that (you) hurriedly make an oath to God to do something. Think it through first!\f + \fr 5:2 \fk Don’t … \ft Literally the source text uses two figures of speech and parallelism, “Don’t be in a hurry with your mouth, and don’t let your heart quickly blurt out something before God.”\f* Because God is in heaven and you are on earth. So let your prayer just be brief.
\p
\v 3 If you have more problems and anxieties, you will be more disturbed by nightmares. The more you talk, the more you will say words that are useless and unreasonable/nonsensical.
\p
\v 4 God does not like the oaths of fools. So if you swear that you will do something for God, do not delay fulfillinging it. Keep that oath of yours!
\v 5 It is better that you not swear to give it than to swear in front of God's house officer but do not do it.
\v 6 Do not sin with your mouth!— so that when the officer of God's house comes to demand that you fulfill your promise, you deny your oath by saying, “Sorry, my speech was wrong. I didn't mean to make that promise.” Don't let (it happen/Heaven forbid) that God gets angry at you and destroys all the results of your efforts.
\p
\v 7 It is better to fear and respect God than to repeatedly make vows to Him carelessly. Because just like having many dreams has no meaning, likewise much talk/babbling has no usefulness.
\s1 There's no meaning to having wealth either
\p
\v 8 Don't be surprised if you see officials oppressing their people, depriving them of their rights, and not making fair decisions. That happens because each official who does that has an agreement with his superior, and both have an agreement also with the superior of even higher rank.
\v 9 Thus the people were always pressured to pay additional taxes to various levels of officials, until finally the king gets his share.\f + \fr 5:9 \fk the king gets his share \ft The Hebrew text of this verse is very difficult, so that it can be understood in many ways. The TSI follows one way of understanding it. This verse if translated literally is, “The profit of a country is taken by all. The king even is served from the fields.” \f*
\p
\v 10 If you love money and try to pile up your wealth, you will never be satisfied with what you have. This is also a futile effort.
\v 11 If you get richer, increasingly many people will join you in spending your wealth. Finally there is no benefit to being rich except every day watching your wealth disappear.
\p
\v 12 A person who works hard throughout the day can sleep soundly— no matter if he eats little or much. But the rich cannot sleep well because they continually feel anxious about their wealth.
\p
\v 13 There is another very sad thing I have seen in this world: People succeed in accumulating wealth, but that wealth only brings misfortune and misery to him.
\v 14 Suddenly everything is gone, until he has nothing left to pass on to his child.
\v 15 As we were born naked, so we will not carry (away) any wealth at all at the moment he leaves this world.
\p
\v 16 This is very truly sad: As we come into this world, so too we leave this world! There is no profit! Isn't that like someone struggling/endeavoring to catch the wind?!
\v 17 As long as we live in this world, we only experience unfortune, hardship, various illnesses, and [persistent anger//sick hearts]. [[The Indonesian idiom 'sick heart' is not the same 'heartache' in English. It is an anger or resentment built up over time.]
\p
\v 18 Because of all this, here are my conclusion and advice: It is better for us to eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of our hard work, because that is the reward/pay that God has given us during (our) temporary life in this world.
\v 19 Besides that, if God entrusts (us with) various wealth and fields for us to own, then if He allows us to enjoy all that, that is a great blessing from Him.
\v 20 If God blesses us like that and we can enjoy this life, maybe we won't be bothered by the realization that life is too short!
