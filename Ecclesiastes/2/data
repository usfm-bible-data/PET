\c 2
\s1 Looking for pleasure is futile
\p
\v 1 In my heart I decided, “OK, I will find out the benefits of having a good time/partying by enjoying everything that makes me happy.” But it turns out that life like that is useless and makes no sense.
\v 2 Even for me to laugh and be happy is a foolish thing and has no benefit.
\v 3 Then— with my mind continuing to lead me wisely— I tried I tried to please myself by drinking as much wine as I want and doing stupid things. That I did because I wanted to find out what kind of life gave usefulness while we live this short life.
\p
\v 4 In my research, I also did great work. I built houses for myself and also made vineyards.
\v 5 I made for myself beautiful gardens and parks, and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
\v 6 I also made ponds for myself to irrigate those trees.
\v 7 I have many male and female slaves— those that I bought or those who were born in my house. I also have livestock, more than anyone who lived in Jerusalem before me.
\v 8 I also amassed gold, silver, and valuable articles from taxes of the kings and the territories which I ruled. For entertainment, I obtained male and female singers. And I also have very many beautiful concubines.\f + \fr 2:8 \fk very many beautiful concubines \ft The last phrase in the Hebrew is very hard to interpret. See the footnote in the NET for various alternatives of the meaning.\f*
\p
\v 9 So that I became a great man who exceeded anyone who lived in Jerusalem before me. In all of the above I remain guided by my wisdom.
\v 10 Whatever I wanted, I would certainly get it. I enjoyed pleasures of all types. I was proud of all the achievements I gained, because that is what became the reward for me.
\v 11 But when I meditated on all the results from the various work projects that I did, and also all my tiring labor to gain them, I concluded that all of it was futile— just like someone trying to catch the wind! In this world there is no benefit in all kinds of the aforementioned work projects!
\s1 It is better to live wisely than to live in stupidity
\p
\v 12 Continuing in my research, I tried to assess the difference between wise living compared with (stubbornly)foolish and thoughtless living. (I felt bored to only do the things that my father used to do as a king!)
\v 13 My conclusion is that living wisely is always better than living in stupidity/ignorance, just as living in the light is better than living in the darkness.
\v 14 A wise person will definitely go on the right path,\f + \fr 2:14 \fk definitely ... \ft The Hebrew uses as idiom that can be translated literally, ‘have eyes in his head’.\f* whereas fools will not. But finally I realized that both of them receive the same fate! [The word we have consistently used for 'fool' (bebal) and 'foolishness' implies a hard-headed refusal to learn or want to improve. It also includes disobedience. Therefore, we have chosen a word that implies the sinfulness of 'foolishness'.]
\v 15 So I thought, “Wow, as is the fate of fools, so will it be for me! If that is the case, there is no benefit in my being so smart and wise! Oh, it turns out that wisdom is also futile!”
\v 16 Because just as a fool will die, so a wise person will die! Neither of the two will be remembered for long. And in the future, they will be completely forgotten.
\p
\v 17 Therefore I hate life, because everything that is done in this world makes one sad/disappointed and ends up being in vain and meaningless— just like someone trying to catch the wind.
\s1 All endeavors are futile
\p
\v 18 So then I also hated all the results of my efforts and tiring labor in this world, because I must leave all of it to the man who will succeed me as king.
\v 19 And whether he will be a fool or a wise man, I do not know. But even if he is a fool, he will still have power over all the results of my tiring labor in this world. What a pity! This is also futile!
\v 20 So I was troubled, because of the futility of all my tiring labor all my life in this world.
\p
\v 21 If we work hard using all our wisdom, knowledge, and expertise, then it's not fair if we are forced to leave it all to someone who has never did anything to get all of that treasure! This [is/appears as] futility and a big loss!
\v 22 So I ask: For what profit do we work hard and have difficulties all our lives in this world ?!
\v 23 Every day we feel pain and tortured because of doing work that is so heavy, but at night, the distress disturbs us so that we cannot sleep well. All this is simply futile!
\p
\v 24 So, I finally concluded that the best path for us is to enjoy food and drink, together with enjoying the results of our work. However I still was aware that those things just mentioned are of course given by God to us for us to enjoy.
\v 25 For without Him we cannot enjoy anything— be it food, drink, or anything else that is pleasant.
\v 26 And if we please God, of course He will gift us with wisdom, knowledge, and happiness. But if we sin against God, He will render the judgment for us to work hard to collect wealth that will later be inherited by those who please Him. This also futile and meaningless — just like someone trying to catch the wind!
