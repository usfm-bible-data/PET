\s1 Looking for pleasure is futile
\p
\v 1 I decided, “Let me test the benefits of having a good time and enjoying yourself.” But it turns out that even that is meaningless and useless.
\v 2 Even laughing is foolishness for me, and even living a life of pleasure is of no use.
\v 3 Then, because I still wanted to learn useful ways of living in this short life in this world, I tried to please myself by drinking as much wine as I want. But while I was doing this research, I didn't let myself get drunk. My mind is still guiding me wisely.
\p
\v 4 In my research, I also did great work. I built houses and also made vineyards for myself.
\v 5 I make gardens, and parks and planted them with all kinds of fruit trees.
\v 6 I also made ponds whose water serves to irrigate those trees to help their growth.
\v 7 I bought many male and female slaves, and there were also many who were born in my house. I have more livestock than those who lived in Jerusalem before me.
\v 8 I also amassed gold, silver and property taken from the kings and the territories which I controlled. For entertainment, I obtained male and female singers. And I got many beautiful wives, and where is there a guy who doesn't like that?!
\p
\v 9 So that I became a great man who exceeded anyone who lived in Jerusalem before me. In all of the above I remain guided by my wisdom.
\v 10 When I wanted something I saw, I got it without thinking of holding back. And I din't hold myself back from any pleasure whatsoever. I rejoiced in the results of all my efforts, and that is what became the reward of those things for me.
\v 11 But finally when I assessed all my efforts and tiring labor, in fact all of it was futile and meaningless — just like someone trying to catch the wind! In this world there is no benefit in all kinds of the aforementioned efforts/occupations!
\s1 It is better to live wisely
\p
\v 12 Continuing in my research, I tried to assess the difference between wise living compared with stupid and thoughtless living. (I felt bored to only do the things that my father used to do as a king!)
\v 13 My conclusion is that living wisely is always better than living in stupidity/ignorance, just as living in the light is better than living in the darkness.
\v 14 A wise person will definitely go on the right path,\f + \fr 2:14 \fk for sure ... \ft The Hebrew uses as idiom that can be translated literally, ‘have eyes in his head’.\f* whereas fools will not. But finally I realized that both of them receive the same fate!
\v 15 So I thought, “Wow, as is the fate of fools, so will it be for me! If that is the case, there is no benefit in my being so smart and wise! Oh it turns out that wisdom is also useless!”
\v 16 Because how unfortunate! As a fool will die, so will a wise person! Neither of the two will be remembered for long. And in the future, they will be completely forgotten.
\p
\v 17 Therefore I hate my life, because everything that is done in this world are ends up being in vain and meaningless— just like someone trying to catch the wind.
\s1 Sagala effort is futile
\p
\v 18 So then I also hated all the results of my efforts and tiring labor in this world, because I must leave all of it to the man who succeeds me as king.
\v 19 And whether he will be a fool or a wise man, I do not know. But even if he is a fool, he will still have all the results of my tiring labor in this world. What a pity! This is also futile!
\v 20 So I was troubled, because of the futility of all my tiring labor all my life in this world.
\p
\v 21 If we work hard using all our wisdom, knowledge, and expertise, then it's not fair if we are forced to leave it all to someone who has never did anything to get all of that treasure! This [is/appears as] futility and a big loss!
\v 22 So I ask: For what profit do we work hard and have difficulties all our lives in this world ?!
\v 23 Every day we feel pain and tortured because of doing work that is so heavy, but at night, the distress disturbs us so that we cannot sleep well. All this is simply futile!
\p
\v 24 So, I finally concluded that the best path for us is to enjoy food and drink, together with enjoying the results of our work. Those things just mentioned are gifted by God to us for us to enjoy.
\v 25 For without Him we cannot enjoy anything— be it food, drink, or anything else that is pleasant.
\v 26 And if we please God, of course He will gift us with wisdom, knowledge, and happiness. But if we sin against God, He will render the judgment for us to work hard to collect wealth that will later be inherited by those who please Him. This also futile and meaningless — just like someone trying to catch the wind!
