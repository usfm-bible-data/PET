\c 8
\q1
\v 1 Only people who have wisdom
\q2 know how to overcome problems that happen in this life.
\q1 And wisdom makes him always smiling happily,
\q2 so that his face continues to look bright.
\s Obedience to the King
\p
\v 2 Obey the commands of the king because you already promised before God to do that.
\v 3 If you attend a meeting with the king, don’t be in a hurry to leave the king's presence. And don’t side with people who oppose the will of the king. Because if you are no longer pleasing to him, you are in danger!\f + \fr 8:3 interpretation of verse 3 \ft This verse literally, “don’t leave from him hastily. Don’t keep holding to something evil, because he can do anything that he wills.” Because the meaning of the first phrase is unclear, there are many variations in the translation of this verse.\f*
\v 4 The king hasthe highest power to give commands. Not even one person can oppose and defy his command.
\v 5 But as long as you obey the king’s commands, you will be saved. If you are wise, you will know when is the time and how to do what is right in the sight of the king.
\v 6 Eventhough you experience many hardships, but there will always be the right time and ways to fulfill your responsibilities according to the commands of the king.
\p
\v 7 Not even a person among us can know and let (others) know what will happen in the future.
\q1
\v 8 There is not even a person who can control the wind,
\q2 likewise, we cannot avoid or delay the day of our death.
\q1 It is impossible for a soldier to be allowed to go home in time of war.
\q2 Likewise, if our actions are evil, it is impossible that we will be freed from punishment
\s Humans cannot understand how God works
\p
\v 9 While striving to understand everything that happens in this world, I observed that when a person has power over many others, often things that bring hardship and harm fall on the people under his power.\f + \fr 8:9 on the people under his power …\fk \ft The Hebrew language can also be interpretted, ‘on him who controls them’.\f*
\v 10 Several times I also attended the funeral for an evil man who died. On the day of the funeral, everyone in his city forgot all his evil deeds and only talked about how they had often seen him in the courtyard of God's House.\f + \fr 8:10 \fk courtyard of God's House \ft The Hebrew text of this verse is very difficult, so that it can be understood in many ways. \f* This just doesn't make sense.
\v 11 Every time an evil person not immediately punished for his evil doings, that also encourages the others to do evil doings also.
\v 12 I observe that evil people can commit serious crimes hundreds of times, but still have long lives.I am still sure that it is better for us to fear and respect God, rather than imitating evil people.
\v 13 Actually, evil people will surely experience hardships because (they) do not fear and respect God. Like shadows when the sun sets, their lives are just temporary.
\p
\v 14 I also observed this futility that happens in this world: Accidents or misfortune happen to people who live righteously, while evil people can continue to be successful without experiencing problems. This futility really makes no sense!
\s Enjoy life in the midst of injustice
\p
\v 15 For that reason, I advise you to have fun in this life! Because there is nothing better we can do than eat, drink, and enjoy this life. At least we can still enjoy the results of our hard work that God gave to us in this earth.
\p
\v 16 Although I already strived to get wisdom about all the efforts that humans do in this earth— that is, why must humans work hard tirelessly day and night—
\v 17 but finally I realized that there is no one who can understand why God designed the earth this way. With all their efforts, humans cannot find the answer. Even though a wise person may say that he has found the answer to that, in reality he does not understand it.
