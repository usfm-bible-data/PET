\s1 Life is full of questions
\p
\v 1 I, the writer of this book, have the position of (an) counselor and king, who replaced my father David as king in Jerusalem. \f + \fr 1: 1 \fk writer of this book ... \ft Even though no name is written in the first verse, it is clear that the writer is king Solomon.\f*
\q1
\v 2 Everything in life is futile and meaningless.
\q2 I as an counselor say, “Life is meaningless!
\q2 Everything is useless, and makes no sense!”
\q1
\v 3 Becauserom our efforts to work hard while living on this earth,
\q2 the result is not satisfying at all!
\q1
\v 4 Every day people are born and people die,
\q2 until a new generation replaces the old generation,
\q2 but the earth still exists.
\q1
\v 5 The sun rises in the east and sets in the west,
\q2 and every day it is returns and rises again.
\q1
\v 6 The wind often blows from the north to the south,
\q2 then it turns repeatedly and then blows again from north to south.
\q1
\v 7 Likewise with rivers:
\q2 All rivers always flow to the sea,
\q2 but the sea never becomes full.
\q2 And the water will turn coming back again to a river and flow again to the sea.
\q1
\v 8 Everything is wearysome—
\q2 until the drab/bored feeling of it can no longer be expressed with words.
\q1 Our eyes aren’t ever satisfied with looking,
\q2 and our ears aren’t ever satisfied with hearing.
\q1
\v 9 Everything that has happened will happen again,
\q2 and everything that has been done will be done again.
\q2 There is nothing really new in this world.
\q1
\v 10 There are people who say, “Look, this is a new event.”
\q2 But actually something like that has previously happened.
\q1 In an age past, long before we were born,
\q2 certainly that previously happened in this world.
\q1
\v 11 We humans don't remember what happened in the past times.
\q2 Likewise, things that have not yet happened in the current age, their history will not be remembered by humans in the future times.
\s1 There's no point in having wisdom\f + \fr 1:11 \fk wisdom \ft In this book King Solomon fokus on wisdom according to secular philosophy, which can be searched for through experience and learned from a teacher. The Indonesian language has another kind of wisdom, which is ‘hikmat’. That is normally thought of as something that is given by God. The TSI will use the word hikmat in books written by Solomon where the context shows God as the source of it.\f*
\p
\v 12 I, the writer, am king in Israel who reigns in Jerusalem.
\v 13 I have endeavored with all my wisdom to investigate about everything that is produced by mankind on this earth. And what I found is that God has burdened mankind with a heavy situation in life.
\v 14 I have seen everything that mankind produces on this earth, and it turns out that it is all in futile and meaningless— just like trying to catch the wind!
\q1
\v 15 What's wrong cannot be made right.
\q1 What has been lost cannot be found again.
\b
\p
\v 16 I said to myself, “Look, I have become wiser, until I am wiser than all the kings who had ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have gained a lot of wisdom and knowledge.”
\v 17 So I decided to explore the difference between wisdom and various kinds of ignorance. But eventually I realized that the research was also futile — just as an attempt to catch the wind.
\q1
\v 18 Because the more wise I become, the more I feel frustrated.
\q2 And the more my knowledge increases, the more my despair/troubles increase.
