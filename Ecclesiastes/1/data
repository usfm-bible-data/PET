\s1 Life is full of questions
\p
\v 1 I, the writer of this book, have the position of (an) counselor and king, who replaced my father David as king in Jerusalem. \f + \fr 1: 1 \fk writer of this book ... \ft Even though no name is written in the first verse, it is clear that the writer is king Solomon. The word ‘proverb’ means a maxim or wise saying that encapsulates some bit of wisdom.\f*
\q1
\v 2 I as an counselor say, “Everything in life is futile and meaningless.
\q2 Everything has no benefit/usefulness, and makes no sense!”
\q1
\v 3 Because our efforts to work hard while living on this earth,
\q2 the result is not satisfying at all!
\q1
\v 4 Every day people are born and people die,
\q2 until a new generation replaces the old generation,
\q2 but the earth still is just the same.
\q1
\v 5 The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, then it comes back again to where it rose.
\q2 And that just continues. Every day it rises and sets.
\q1
\v 6 The wind often blows from the north to the south, then it turns and turns,
\q2 and while it turns the wind comes back to the place it blew (from).
\q2 And that just continues. The wind comes back to the same direction.
\q1
\v 7 Likewise with rivers:
\q2 All rivers always flow to the sea, but the sea never becomes full.
\q2 The water returns to the river's head waters.
\q2 And that just continues. The water flows again to the sea.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Everything is very boring—
\q2 until there is no one who can express the weariness of that boredom.
\q1 Our eyes see whatever, but the eyes never feel satisfied— so that there is no need to see again.
\q2 Similarly our ears hear whatever, but the ears never feel satisfied— so that there is no longer need for hearing.
\q1
\v 9 Everything that has happened will happen again,
\q2 and everything that has been done will be done again.
\q2 There is nothing really new in this world.
\q1
\v 10 There are people who say, “Look, this thing just newly happened.”
\q2 But actually something like that has previously happened
\q2 long before we were born in this world.
\q1
\v 11 People don't remember what happened in the past times.
\q2 Likewise, things that happen now will not be remembered by people in the future times.
\s1 There is no point in having wisdom\f + \fr 1:11 \fk wisdom \ft In this book King Solomon fokus on wisdom according to secular philosophy, which can be searched for through experience and learned from a teacher. The Indonesian language has another kind of wisdom, which is ‘hikmat’. That is normally thought of as something that is given by God. The TSI will use the word hikmat in books written by Solomon where the context shows God as the source of it.\f*
\p
\v 12 I, the writer, am king in Israel who reigns in Jerusalem.
\v 13 I have endeavored with all my wisdom to investigate about everything that is produced by mankind on this earth. And what I found is that God has burdened mankind with a heavy situation in life.
\v 14 I have seen everything that mankind produces on this earth, and it turns out that it is all in futile and meaningless— just like someone who tries to catch the wind!
\q1
\v 15 What's wrong cannot be made right.
\q1 What has been lost cannot be found again.
\b
\p
\v 16 I said to myself, “Look, I have become wiser, until I am wiser than all the kings who had ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have gained a lot of wisdom and knowledge.”
\v 17 So I decided to explore the difference between wisdom and various kinds of ignorance. But eventually I realized that the research was also futile — just as someone attempting to catch the wind.
\q1
\v 18 Because the more I grow in wisdom, paradoxically the more I am disappointed.
\q2 And the more I grow in knowledge, paradoxically the more I suffer.
