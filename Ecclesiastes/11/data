\q1 So if you are given long life, give thanks and enjoy every day,
\q2 because what happens after death is still a mystery.\f + \fr 11:8 \fk mystery \ft The word translated ‘mystery’ has previously been translated in this book as ‘futile and without meaning’. But in hoe context of death, its meaning is more like ‘nothingness’. The idea— according to the writer— is that there is absolutely no understanding about our (future) state after death.\f*

\q2 Because your youth will quickly pass in futility.
