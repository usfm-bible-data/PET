\v 1 Then I noticed all the oppression that happens in this world. And what a pity! The oppressed cry and no one comforts them, because exceedingly powerful are the oppressors who oppress them.
\v 2 So my opinion is that people who have died are happier than those who are still living.
\v 3 But actually, happier people are those who have not yet been born and have not seen the various kinds of evil committed in this world.
\v 4 I have also witnessed many people struggling to achieve success simply because they are motivated by jealousy of others. Indeed that is also futile— just like someone trying to catch the wind!

\v 5 A fool folds his hands—
\q2 does not work and lets himself starve.

\v 6 It is better to have a few possessions accompanied with calmness,
\q2 rather than a lot of wealth but with struggling
\q2 at work— like someone trying to catch the wind.
\s Friendship that brings profit
\p
\v 7 Here also is an example of futility that troubles me in this world:
\v 8 There is a person who lives alone, without the help of children or siblings. And without stopping he works hard and is never ever satisfied with the possessions/wealth he has. I marvelled that that person did not ask himself in his heart, “Why should I not have fun with some of the results of my wearisome efforts? When I die, there are no close family (members) who will inherit all my wealth!”
\p How futile is a life like this! What a pity!
\p
\v 9 Two (people) are better than one person alone, because they get better profit/wages from the results of their hard work.
\v 10 And if one of them falls, then the other can help him to stand up. But (it is) really too bad if someone all by himself falls, then there isn't another who can help him to stand.
\v 11 If two people sleep side by side, then they can reciprocally warm each other (up). On the other hand, it's hard to feel warmth when you're (all) alone.
\v 12 For example in a fight, a person by himself will easily be defeated by an enemy. But if there are two of them, it is more likely they will survive. Three people will be even stronger. They are like three strings of rope woven together, difficult to break.
\s Even becoming king is meaningless
\p
\v 13 It is better to be a poor but wise young man than an old king who is hard headed and who is no longer willing to take the advice of others.
\v 14 Because a young man like that can escape from poverty and do well— even though he was previously imprisoned. He might even become a king.
\p
\v 15 Whoever becomes a king in this world will later die, then everyone will quickly support the new young man who replaces him.
\v 16 Even if that successor is rules over so many people that they are countless, future generations will not gratefully-remember or respect him. So even becoming a king is futile, just like someone trying to catch the wind!
