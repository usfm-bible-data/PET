\c 6
\p
\v 1 I have seen that there is one condition which is not good, which is very weighty/depressing and saddening for humans on this earth:
\v 2 God bestows wealth and honor on a person that he does not lack anything, but God does not allow him to enjoy his wealth. In the end others enjoy it! This misfortune and futility is very saddening.
\p
\v 3 Even though the rich man has a hundred children, and he lives a long time until he is very old, but if that wealth of his does not make him happy, and if when he dies he is not properly buried, then I say, “It would be far better if he had died when he was born!”
\v 4 For baby that is dead when born won't be busy thinking about the meaning of his life in this world. He just directly enters into the darkness of his grave. He doesn't even have a name.
\v 5 Even though he has never seen sunlight and knows nothing about human life in this world, he can rest more peacefully than the rich man.
\v 6 Even if a rich person lives up to two thousand years, but if he doesn't enjoy his wealth, then all of that is for nothing! Because the end of life is always the same, namely experiencing death.
\p
\v 7 We work hard in order to get something to eat, but we are never satisfied!
\v 8 So neither the wise nor the fool, rich or poor, it makes no difference! There is a difference in their way of life, but when they die, they are just the same!
\p
\v 9 Yes, it's better to enjoy what you have, rather than wanting something that you don't have. It's all futile— just like someone trying to catch the wind!
\s1 Fate and the future
\p
\v 10 Everything that happens has been determined by God since long ago. We are only weak human beings, and it is not proper (for us) to dispute (with) our Creator.\f + \fr 6:10 \fk interpretation of verse 10 \ft In the interpretation of this verse— especially in directly mentioning ‘God’ and ‘our Creator’— the translation team followed NET.\f*
\p
\v 11 The more we protest our destiny, the more futile our words! What's the use of arguing?!
\p
\v 12 No one knows the best way to live while in this world— in this short and futile life. Because no one knows what will happen after we no longer exist in this world.
