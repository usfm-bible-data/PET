\v 9 Actually, what benefits do humans get from all their hard work?
\v 10 I have seen that God has burdened humans with a very heavy situation in life.
\v 11 God has arranged for everything to happen exactly at the time that He has determined. He gave people the desire to know the future age(s), however there is no one who is able to understand what God has done from beginning to end.
\v 12 I finally realized that there is nothing better for humans than to rejoice in everything we enjoy as long as we live.
\v 13 If we can eat, drink, and enjoy the fruits of our labor, it is a blessing from God.
\v 14 I realize that whatever God has decreed is eternal forever. Nothing can increase or decrease it. This God has done that so people respect Him.
\v 15 What is happening now, this has happened a long time ago. And everything that will happen, has also happened long ago. It is God who arranged things like that, so that what has happened will be repeated again and again.
\s1 Injustice always exists in this world
\p
\v 16 I also saw that things that happen in this world are often unfair. Wherever justice and truth should be upheld, there instead crime and fraud often occur.
\v 17 I said to myself: If it is true that the time has been determined for all sorts of events, it means that there will come a time when God will judge everyone— both the righteous and the evil.
\v 18 Then I thought, "Wow, it turns out that God is testing all humans with the aim of making us aware that our lives are no different from the lives of cattle!"
\v 19 [The fate of// What happens to] humans and cattle is the same. Humans and animals alike have breath and will surely die. Humans have no advantages over cattle. Certainly life is futile and meaningless!
\v 20 Because eventually— both the bodies of humans and animals— will head to the same place. All living things come from the soil and will return to soil.\x + \xo Gen. 2: 7 \x*
\v 21 Who knows if the human spirit will go up and the animal spirit go down to the earth?
\v 22 So I see that there is nothing better for humans than to enjoy the fruits of their individual work, because apart from that there is nothing else we can do. Because we each cannot possibly know what will happen when we no longer exist in this world.
