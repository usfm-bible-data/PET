\c 7
\s1 The minds of the wise and fools
\q1
\v 1 It is better to have a good name than luxurious treasures in the form of expensive fragrances.
\q2 Likewise, the day of our death is better than the day of our birth.
\q1
\v 2 It's better to attend a funeral than to attend a party,
\q2 because in our mourning we will ponder that death is waiting for us all.
\q1
\v 3 It's better to live with sadness than to (continually [reduplication]) have fun,
\q2 because in sadness we can understand the true meaning of life.
\q1
\v 4 A fool is just looking for fun every day,
\q2 but a wise man ponders death.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Better to listen to the rebuke of a wise person
\q2 rather than hearing words of a fool praising you.
\q1
\v 6 Like the sound of thorns burning under a cauldron— burning up very quickly but the pan/pot doesn't get hot—
\q2 similarly the laughter of a fool is futile and meaningless.
\b
\q1
\v 7 (A person's/The) intention of corruption will turn the wise person into a fool.
\q2 Bribery corrupts his heart and mind.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Getting something done makes one happier than getting something started.
\q2 Patience is better than being arrogant.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Don't let your heart get angry quickly.
\q2 Anger remains in the hearts of fools.
\b
\q1
\v 10 Do not ask: "Why was the condition/situation better before than it is now?"
\q2 That is a stupid question.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Becoming wise can be compared to receiving a large inheritance.
\q2 But wisdom will help you throughout your life journey in this world.
\q1
\v 12 Wisdom is like money.
\q2 Both can provide protection.
\q2 But the advantage of having wisdom is that wisdom can save your life.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Pay attention to what God has done!
\q2 No one at all can change what He has decided.\f + \fr 7:13 \fk No one can change … \ft Literally the Hebrew text says, “Consider what God has done! For who can straighten what he has made crooked?”\f*
\q2 But who can change what He has decreed?
\q1
\v 14 When your life is happy, be joyful.
\q2 But when your life is having a hard time,
\q3 remember that God gives pleasure and distress.
\q2 God has arranged everything so that no one can know what will happen in the future in his life.
\s1 Human wisdom is limited
\p
\v 15 In my futile life I have seen two things that I don't like. Sometimes a good person dies when he is young, even though he had done good as long he lived. And I also saw a wicked person living into old age, even though he continued to do evil.
\v 16 So here is my advice: In this life, do not consider yourself exceptionally righteous in God’s sight, and do not consider yourself the wisest. Because doing like that will destroy yourself!
\v 17 And do not give over your life only to do evil and foolishness. It only makes you die sooner!
\v 18 Avoid these two things, because each person who respects and fears God is able to guard himself.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Become wise!
\q2 Because the strength of a wise person exceeds the strength of ten leaders of his city.
\b
\q1
\v 20 On this earth there is no righteous person
\q2 who always does good and never sins.
\b
\q1
\v 21 Don't enjoy listening to what other people say.
\q2 It's not worth being offended when you hear your slave badmouthing you!
\q2
\v 22 Remember that you've also many times badmouthed other people!
\b
\p
\v 23 About all of the above, I have tried to research (those things) very diligently, because I thought, “Let me be the wisest person." But I feel (myself) still far from the end (point) that I was looking for.
\v 24 The wisdom about the aforementioned matters is far from me and too difficult to find.
\v 25 Nevertheless I continued searching and studying, trying to discover wisdom from many different angles. I tried to prove that doing evil is hard-headed/foolish. Only a crazy person will continue to live foolishly. [This last word is the normal word for foolish/stupid. Not the hard-headed word.]
\p
\v 26 I see that women who enjoy seducing men are like traps, and their hands are like iron chains. It's better to die than get caught by a woman like that! The sinner will fall into her trap. But those who want to please God will escape.
\p
\v 27 Now, I, the writer as an advisor, want to summarize the results of my research. But after researching these things one by one and from various aspects,
\v 28 I did not find what I was looking for! Out of a thousand men, I have found only one who was wise and worthy of respect. But I have never found a wise woman.
\v 29 One thing that I learned is that God made mankind to live rightly, but we ourselves have gone off on crooked paths.
