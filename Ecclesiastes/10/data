\s Hard-headedness and injustice
\q1
\v 1 Like a dead fly can cause all the perfume in a bottle smell rotten,
\q2 so also if we add a little bit of hard-headedness into a wise plan, we can erase the wisdom and honor.
\q1
\v 2 The hearts of wise people lead them to do right things,
\q2 but the hearts of hard-headed people tend to lead them to do evil things.
\q1
\v 3 We can recognize who are hard-headed just by how their prideful demeanor when walking in the city.
\q2 Eventhough (we) don’t yet know them, it is very obvious, “There is a stone-headed/hard-headed man!”
\b
\q1
\v 4 When a leader becomes angry towards you,
\q2 keep calm and don’t stop working according to your tasks under him.
\q2 If you keep calm, he may forgive your various wrong-doings, eventhough they are not small.
\b
\p
\v 5 This again is a serious mistake that I have observed in this world— a kind of mistake done by a ruler:
\v 6 Hard-headed men are placed in high positions, while rich men are placed in low positions.
\v 7 Likewise I have observed a slave riding a horse, while his superior walked on foot behind (him) like a slave.
\b
\q1
\v 8 Be careful when digging a hole, so that you don’t fall into it.
\q2 Be careful when you break down the wall. (Watch) lest there is snake hiding there that could bite you.
\q1
\v 9 Be careful when you work in mining. (Watch) lest a rock falls and hits you.
\q2 And be careful when you split woods, because the ax could wound you.
\q1
\v 10 It is very stupid if you work with dull machete! It’s better to sharpen it first, so you don’t have to work hard to cut something.
\q2 Likewise with your life: It is always better to work with wisdom.
\q1
\v 11 If you train yourself to be a snake charmer,
\q2 all your hardwork will be futile if you let the snake bite you.
\b
\q1
\v 12 The sayings of the wise brings honor to himself,
\q2 but when a hard-headed person opens his mouth, he only harms himself.
\q1
\v 13 His talk starts (off) with his stupidity,
\q2 and the longer he talks, the more evil and hard-headed his speech becomes.
\q3
\v 14 But he continues to talk.
\b
\q1 There is no one who knows what will happen in the future.
\q2 Who among humans can guess that?!
\b
\q1
\v 15 Because of working without thinking ahead, a hard-headed person quickly feels tired.
\q1 After work, the hard-headed person forgets his way hom to his house!
\b
\q1
\v 16 A kingdom faces many probems when the king is someone young,
\q2 and his officials party all night until morning.
\q1
\v 17 But blessed is a kingdom whose king is authoritative,
\q2 and (where) its leaders eat according to a set schedule, are able to control themselves, and don’t get drunk.
\b
\q1
\v 18 A lazy person does not want to fix the roof of his house that leaks— however small that (leak) is,
\q2 and eventually the whole roof of his house will collapse because of decay.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Feasts are made/held and completed with wine to make the invitees happy,
\q2 as long as there is money.
\b
\q1
\v 20 Don’t talk bad about the king or rich people at all!
\q2 Whether personally in your bedroom, or only in your heart, don’t!
\q2 That person may know/perceive your thoughts—
\q3 as if there is a bird that (over)hears from a window and flies to report your opinions to him.
