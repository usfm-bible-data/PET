\s Hard-headedness and injustice
\q1
\v 1 Like a dead fly can cause all the perfume in a bottle smell rotten,
\q2 so also if we add a little bit of hard-headedness into a wise plan, we can erase wisdom and honor.
\q1
\v 2 The hearts of wise people lead them to do right things,
\q2 but the hearts of hard-headed people tends to lead them to do evil things.
\q1
\v 3 We can recognize who are hard-headed just by how they move pridefully when walking in the city.
\q2 Eventhough (we) don’t know them yet, it is very obvious, “He is a stone-headed (hard-headed) man.”
\b
\q1
\v 4 When a leader becomes angry towards you,
\q2 keep calm and don’t stop working according to your tasks to him.
\q2 If you keep calm, he can forgive your various wrong-doings, eventhough they are not small.
\b
\p
\v 5 This again is a mistake that I have observed in this world— a kind of mistake done by a ruler:
\v 6 Hard-headed men are placed on a higher position, while rich men are placed on a lower position.
\v 7 Likewise I have observed a slave riding a horse, while the noblemen walk on foot from behind like slaves.

\q1
\v 8 Be careful when digging a hole, so that you won’t fall inside.
\q2 Be careful when you break down the wall. Lest there is snake hiding there that bites you.
\q1
\v 9 Be careful when you work in mining. Lest rocks fall and hit you.
\q2 And be careful when you split woods, because woods can injure you.
\q1
\v 10 It is very stupid if you work with dull machete! Iti s better if you sharpen it first so you don’t work hard to cut something.
\q2 Likewise with yourlife: It is always better to work wisely.
\q1
\v 11 If you train yourself to be a snake charmer,
\q2 all your hardwork will be futile if you let the snake bite you.
\b
\q1
\v 12 The sayings of the wise brings honor to himself,
\q2 but when a hard-headed person opens his mouth, he only harms himself.
\q1
\v 13 His speech/words begins with his stupidity,
\q2 and the longer he talks, the more evil and hard-headed his speech is.
\q3
\v 14 But he continues to talk.
\b
\q1 There is no one who knows what will happen in the future.
\q2 Who among humans can guess that?!
\b
\q1
\v 15 Because of working without thinking ahead, a hard-headed person quickly feels tired.
\q1 After work, the hard-headed person forgets his way hom to his house!
\b
\q1
\v 16 A kingdom faces many probems when the king is someone young,
\q2 and his officials party all night until morning.
\q1
\v 17 But blessed is a kingdom whose king is authoritative,
\q2 and his leaders eat according to a set schedule, abe to control them, and not drunk.
\b
\q1
\v 18 A lazy person does not want to fix the roof of his house that leaks— however small that is,
\q2 and eventually the whole roof of your house will collapse because of decay
\b
\q1
\v 19 There will be feasts and supplemented with wine to make the invitees happy,
\q2 as long as there is money.
\b
\q1
\v 20 Don’t talk bad about the king or rich people at all!
\q2 Whether personally in your bedroom, or only in your heart, don’t!
\q2 That person can know your thoughts—
\q3 as if there is a bird that hears from the window and flows to report your opinions to him.
