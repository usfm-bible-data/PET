\c 9
\s1 The fate of everyone is death
\p
\v 1 So I ponder all those things and conclude that everything that is hoped for and done/worked by righteous people and wise people are in the hands of God alone. Whether they will be loved or hated, no one can know before it happens.
\q1
\v 2 The same fate happens to everyone—
\q2 whether to righteous people or evil (people),
\q2 whether to unclean people or to ritually-pure people,
\q2 whether to people who offer animal sacrifices or people who do not offer sacrifices.
\q1 The same incident falls on anyone—
\q2 including good people, sinful people,
\q2 whether people who dare to vow to give something to God or people who are afraid to vow.
\p
\v 3 This is obviously not fair and very saddening: The same fate falls on everyone! All (our) lives on this earth, our heart and mind are filled with evilness and foolishness, until we die.
\v 4 But as long as we live, we still have hope. We can describe our condition like this: A dog that is still alive is better than a lion that is already dead.
\p
\v 5 Because we who are alive know that we will die. But they who are dead already do not know anything. They cannot obtain anything else, no one even reminisce about them.
\v 6 The love, hate, and jealousy that they felt while still alive, everything dissapears with their death. Forever they can no longer be involved with what people who are alive on this earth are doing.
\v 7 So (please just/go ahead and) enjoy all kinds of dishes and wine\f + \fr 9:7 \fk enjoy all kinds of dishes and wine \ft In Hebrew it literally says, “Enjoy your bread and rejoice over your wine.” The meaning of this sentence is that someone can enjoy food and drink in aneordinary way. So, there is no indication of partying or drunkenness.\f* as long as you live, because doing that is pleasing to God.
\v 8 May you always wear beautiful clothing and your face always cheerful.\f + \fr 9:8 \fk translation of figurative style \ft Both metaphors in this verse can be interpreted more literally like this, “May your clothing be white all the time, and may your head not lack oil.”\f*
\p
\v 9 Enjoy life with her who is your love— that is your wife— throughout the life that God gives to you which is so short and useless. Because God gave you that (enjoyment) as your reward over all your hard work while you live on this earth.
\v 10 Whatever you find to do, do with all your strength, because you realize that soon you will die. When you already enter the grave, there is nothing that you can do or plan. And there will be no more opportunity to obtain knowledge or wisdom.
\p
\v 11 I also observed these things in my life on this earth:
\q2 A person who can run the fastest do not always win the race.
\q2 The strongest soldier does not always win the battle.
\q2 A wise person can experience hunger.
\q2 A smart person does not always succeed in becoming rich.
\q2 A person with knowledge is not always successful.
\q1 Because by happenstance anyone at all can experience misfortune or success.
\p
\v 12 Like fish and bird that are suddenly caught in a net or snare, so also no one knows when misfortune will fall on him.
\s1 About wisdom and hard-headedness
\p
\v 13 I also saw this example that I consider important about how wisdom is valued in this world.
\v 14 There is a small city with a small number of population. One day a famous king came who wanted to conquer that city. The king told his soldiers to attack and surround that city to break into (that city).
\v 15 But in that city there is a wise poor man. Through his wisdom he saved that city. But after that incident, the inhabitants of the city forgot him and did not respect him.
\v 16 But in my opinion it is better if you have wisdom rather than strength. But if you are poor, you will be looked down on and your wise words will not be heeded.
\b
\q1
\v 17 It is better to listen to words that are conveyed with a gentle voice by a wise person
\q2 than to the screams of a ruler among a group of hard-headed people.
\q1
\v 18 Having wisdom is a greater power than weapons of war.
\q2 But involving just one (sinfully) hard-headed person can damage much progress.
