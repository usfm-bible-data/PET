\c 12
\q1
\v 1 Remember your Creator in your youth,
\q2 before you become old and your life becomes difficult
\q2 until you say,
\q2 “I can’t any longer enjoy the pleasures of this life.”
\q1
\v 2 Because when you are old, it is too late to serve your Creator—
\q2 when your eyes becomes so blurred so that you can no longer see the stars and moon,
\q2 and day time is no longer bright, but like the sky is always covered with dark clouds.
\q2
\v 3 (Your) hands and feet that used to be strong will tremble.
\q2 Before you stood up straight/tall,
\q3 but later your backbone will be bent.
\q2 Your teeth used to be complete,
\q3 but later you will have difficulty eating because your teeth will be gone.
\q2 At that time your eyes will still see,
\q3 but only like shadows\f + \fr 12:43 about the figurative style \ft Verses 3-6 contain several metaphors that are difficult to understand for modern readers. The TSI follows the interpretation found in the NLT for the previously mentioned verses, and the literal form is given in footnotes. Verse 3 can be translated more literally, “when the house guards tremble, strong men bend their backs, women who grind stops because they are only a few, and they who peer from the window have their vision blurred.”\f*
\b
\q1
\v 4 When still young, you could differenciate sounds outside the door of your house—\f + \fr 12:4 \fk about literary style \ft The metaphore on this line is literally, “when doors on the road are closed,”\f*
\q2 sounds of helpers grinding wheat, and sounds/voices of birds.
\q2 But later your ears will no longer be able to differenciate sounds.
\q3 Even so, when small birds start to chirp before the dawn, you will be woken up and won’t be able to get back to sleep.
\b
\q1
\v 5 When you become old, you will be afraid to go up stairs
\q3 or just to walk in level places.
\q2 Your hair will be white like snow.\f + \fr 12:5 \fk your hair \ft Literally, “almond trees blossoms.” The white flowers of this tree became a metaphor for the white hair of an old person.\f*
\q2 Like an old grasshopper that can no longer jump, likewise you will be in your old age later on
\q2 At that time even medicine to awaken your sexual desires will not work anymore.\f + \fr 12:5 \fk medicine … \ft Literally, “Caper seeds are no longer effective.” The seeds of caper flowers can be eaten and are considered to arouse sexual desire\f*
\q1 Finally you will die to go your palce forever,\f + \fr 12:5 \fk your place forever \ft Literally, ‘eternal house.’ Eventhough it is not mentioned, the meaning is the grave or Sheol. See the note on Psalm 6:5.\f*
\q2 and in your city your friends will mourn.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Not much longer your life will end—
\q2 like a fine silver necklace chain that breaks, or golden bowl/goblet that is crushed.
\q1 Finished are all the activities of your life—
\q2 like a water pump at a well that is completely broken.
\q1 Your body is destroyed—
\q2 like a clay vessel that is destroyed.\f + \fr 12:6 \fk literally style \ft The four obje¨cts in this verse are metaphors that describe death.\f*
\b
\q1
\v 7 Then your body that comes from the soil will return to be soil again like initially,
\q2 and your breath of life will return to God who gave it to you.
\s1 The writer’s conclusion
\p
\v 8 So my conclusion as an advisor and the writer is: Everything in this life is just futile! Very futile!
\p
\v 9-10 I as an advisor have strived to be a wise teacher, so that I can teach knowledge to others in a very honest and righteous manner. I have compiled the result of my research in the form of sayings that are nice to listen to, so that others can obtain wisdom.
\b
\q1
\v 11 The teachings of an advisor is like a shepherd’s stick
\q2 that he use to guide and direct his sheep.
\q1 May every saying given by this advisor and shepherd be strongly nailed/stuck in the minds of every learner.
\q1
\v 12 O my children, study this collection of advice that I am teaching,
\q2 but be careful towards books of advice from other writers.
\q1 People will continue to write new books.
\q2 You can study too much through books
\q3 until finally you only become tired.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Take a final conclusion from all these things:
\q2 Give honor and fear God and obey all His commandments,
\q3 because that is our foremost responsibility before God.
\q1
\v 14 Because God will judge all our deeds—
\q2 whether good or bad,
\q3 even the hidden ones.
