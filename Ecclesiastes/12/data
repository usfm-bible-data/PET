\v 1 Remember your Creator in your youth,
\q2 before you become old and your life become difficult
\q1 that you say,
\q2 “I cannot any longer enjoy pleasures of this life.”
\q1
\v 2 Because when you are old, it is too late to serve your Creator—
\q2 when your eyes becomes so blurred so that you can no longer see the stars and moon,
\q2 and day time is no longer bright, but like sky that is always covered with dark clouds.
\q2
\v 3 Hands and feet that used to be strong will tremble.
\q2 Before you stood up tall,
\q3 but later your backbone will bend.
\q2 Before your teeth are complete,
\q3 but later you will have difficulty eating because your teeth will run out.
\q2 That time your eyes will still see,
\q3 but only like shadows\f + \fr 12:4 \fk tentang gaya bahasa \ft Mup,”\f*

\q1
\v 4 When still young, you can differenciate sounds outside the door of your house—\f + \fr 12:4 \fk tentang gaya bahasa \ft Mup,”\f*
\q2 sounds of helpers grinding wheat, and sounds of birds.
\q2 But later your ears will no longer be able to differenciate sounds.
\q3 Even so, when small birds start to chirp before the dawn, you are woken up and cannot go back to sleep.
\b
\q1
\v 5 When you become old, you will be afraid of walking—
\q2 whether on the main road, [on uneven roads, or on top of the mountain//even more on uneven roads and also climb the mountain].
\q2 Your hair will be white like snow \f + \fr 12:5 \fk rambutmu \ft Seg tua.\f*
\q2 Like an old grasshopper that can no longer jump, likewise you will be in your old age later on
\q2 At that time even medicine to awaken your sexual desires will not work anymore.\f + \fr 12:5 \fk rambutmu \ft Seg tua.\f*
\q1 Finally you will die to go your palce forever,\f + \fr 12:5 \fk rambutmu \ft Seg tua.\f*
\q2 and in your city your friends will mourn.
\b
\q1
\v 6 Not much longer your life will end—
\q2 like fine silver necklace chain that breaks, or golden down that is crushed.
\q1 Complete is all your activities of your life—
\q2 like a well water pump that is completely broken.
\q1 Your body is destroyed—
\q2 like a clay vessel that is destroyed. \f + \fr 12:5 \fk rambutmu \ft Seg tua.\f*
\b
\q1
\v 7 Then your body that comes from the soil will return to be soil again like initially,
\q2 and your breath of life will return to God who gave (it) to you[0// when you were born]
\s1 The writers’ conclusion
\p
\v 8 So my conclusion as an advisor and writer [0//of this book] is: Everything in this life is just futile! Very futile!
\p
\v 9-10 I as an advisor have strived to be a wise teacher, so that I can teach knowledge to others in a very honest and righteous manner. I have compiled the result of my research in the form of sayings that are nice to listen to, so that others can obtain wisdom.
\b
\q1
\v 11 The teachings of an advisor is like a shepherd’s stick
\q2 that he use to guide and direct his sheeps
\q1 May every saying given by this advisor and shepherd stick strongly in the minds of every learner.
