\s Jesus washes the feet of His disciples
\p
\v 1 On the night before the Passover Celebration Day, Jesus knew that the time had come for Him to leave this world and return to His Father. Jesus always loved everyone who had become His own in this world, and in that way He kept proving His love for us until the last day of His life.
\p
\v 2 At the time that Jesus and we disciples of His were eating supper together, the devil had already worked in the heart of Judas so that he planned to sell Jesus to His enemies. (This Judas was the son of Simon from the village of Cariot.)
\v 3 Jesus knew that His Father had already surrendered all power into His hand. He also knew that He came from God and it was almost time for Him to return to God.
\v 4 While we were eating, Jesus stood up and took off His robe. Then He took a towel and tied it around His waist.
\v 5 He put water into a basin and began to wash all of our feet and dried them again with the towel which He had tied around His waist.
\p
\v 6 When He came to Peter, who was also called Simon, Peter said to Him, “Lord, You don’t need to wash my feet.”
\p
\v 7 Then Jesus answered him, “You won’t understand what I’m doing now, but you’ll understand later on.”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter\f + \fr 13:8 \fk Peter \ft Literally, “Simon Peter.” Using both names like that means, “Peter who was also called Simon’. The two names are also translated ‘Peter’ in verses 24 and 36, and several other verses in this Gospel.\f* said again, “I'll never allow You to wash my feet!”
\p But Jesus said to him, “If I don’t wash your feet, you’re no longer My follower.”
\p
\v 9 Then Peter said to Him, “Lord, if that’s so, don’t just wash my feet but wash my hands and my head too!”
\p
\v 10 Jesus said to him, “The body of a person who has bathed is already clean. After he walks around he only needs to wash his feet. Most of you are holy in the eyes of God, but one of you isn’t holy.”
\v 11 Jesus said that because He knew who had already planned to sell Him. That’s why He said, “One of you is not holy.”
\p
\v 12 After Jesus washed all of our feet He put on His robe again and returned to His seat. Then He said to us, “Do you understand what I did to you just now?
\v 13 You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and those two titles are correct because that’s what I really am.
\v 14 So even though I’m your Teacher and Lord, I’ve humbled Myself like a servant and washed your feet. That means you must also wash each other’s feet.
\v 15 I’ve given you this example so that you'll do the same thing that I’ve done to you.
\v 16 What I’m saying is really true. A servant isn’t greater than his master. In the same way someone who represents another person isn’t greater than the one who sent him.
\v 17 That’s definitely clear. So you’ll be truly blessed if you follow My example and serve each other.
\p
\v 18 “I don’t say that about all of you because I know those whom I’ve chosen. But what’s written in the Word of the Lord must be fulfilled which says,
\q1 ‘My friend who usually ate with Me
\q2 became My enemy.’\f + \fr 13:18 \fk became My enemy \ft Literally, “lifted up his heal against Me.” This sentence is a quote from Ps. 41:10.\f*
\m
\v 19 I’m telling you this now so that when he acts, you’ll believe that I’m the one you’re waiting for.
\p
\v 20 What I’m saying is really true. Whoever accepts a person whom I send accepts Me. And whoever accepts Me accepts the Father who sent Me.”
\s Jesus tells plainly about who will sell Him
\r (Matt. 26:20-25; Mark 14:17-21; Luke 22:21-23)
\p
\v 21 When Jesus said that, He became very sad. Then He said honestly, “What I’m telling you is really true. One of you will sell Me to My enemies.”
\p
\v 22 We felt confused and looked at each other,because we didn’t know who He meant.
\v 23 I, the disciple whom Jesus loved very much,\f + \fr 13:23 \fk the disciple whom Jesus loved very much \ft As usual, John didn’t literally write ‘I’ about himself in this verse. But John’s identity as that disciple was revealed by John in John 21:24-25. (See the note in John 1:35.)\f* was sitting near Jesus' right side.\f + \fr 13:23 \fk sitting near...Jesus' right \ft Literally, John wrote “leaning on Jesus’ chest.” At that time the Jews didn’t use chairs when they ate, and they used low tables. So when they ate they leaned on their left elbow and ate with the right hand.\f*
\v 24 Then Peter gave me a sign with his hand so that I would ask Jesus whom He meant.
\p
\v 25 Then I turned around so that I was even closer and whispered to Him, “Lord, who is that man?”
\p
\v 26 Then He answered, “The one who receives the bread that I dip, he’s the man.” After saying that He took a piece of bread and dipped it in the bowl, then gave it to Judas the son of Simon, from Cariot.
\v 27 When Judas ate the bread the devil immediately entered his heart. Then Jesus said to him, “Do what you’re planning to do quickly.”
\v 28 But none of us who were eating there understood what Jesus meant when He said that to Judas.
\v 29 Because Judas was the treasurer, some of us thought that Jesus meant for him to buy something that was needed for the following days of the celebration. There were also those who thought that Jesus wanted him to give something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 So as soon as he ate the bread he left immediately. It was already night at the time.
\s Jesus speaks about His death and gives a new commandment
\p
\v 31 After Judas went out Jesus said to us, “Now it’s time for Me, the Son of Man, to be glorified. And God will be glorified through what happens to Me.
\v 32 Because I'll glorify God, He’ll also glorify Me. And He’ll do it soon.”
\p
\v 33 Jesus said again, “My children, I'll be with you for just a short time now and after that you’ll search for Me. So now I’m telling you the same thing I told the Jewish leaders, you can’t come to the place I’m going.
\p
\v 34 I’m giving a new command to you, which is that you must love each other. And you must love each other in the same way that I’ve loved you.
\v 35 If you love each other, then everyone will know that you’re My disciples.”
\s Jesus says that Peter will deny Him
\r (Matt. 26:31-35; Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34)
\p
\v 36 Then Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, where are You going?”
\p And He answered, “You can’t go with Me to the place I’m going now, but at a later time you’ll follow Me there.”
\p
\v 37 Peter asked again, “Lord, why can’t I follow You now? I’m ready to surrender my life to save You.”
\p
\v 38 Jesus answered, “You want to surrender your life to save Me? You can’t! What I’m telling you is really true. Before the rooster crows, you’ll say that you don’t know Me three times.”
