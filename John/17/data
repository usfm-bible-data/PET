\s Jesus’ prayer for His followers
\p
\v 1 After Jesus said all of that to us disciples of His, He looked to the sky and prayed, “Father, now the time has come. Glorify Me through what will happen to Me, Your Son. In this way I'll also glorify You.
\v 2 For You’ve given Me authority over everyone so that I can give eternal life to each person that You’ve given to Me.”
\mi
\v 3 Because I remember that prayer of Jesus’, I, John also pray to God, “Father, this is definitely true! This is the way to receive eternal life, that is to know You as the one and only true God, and also to know Christ Jesus, whom You’ve sent to this world.\f + \fr 17:3 \fk Verse 3 \ft Many interpreters say that verse 3 is the thoughts of the writer, and not the words of Jesus. John put his own comments several times in this Gospel, including 2:11, 3:16-21, 19:35, 20:30-31, and 21:23-25.\f*
\m
\v 4 And Jesus continued praying, “Father, I’ve glorified You in this world through all the work You’ve given Me to do. Now that work is finished.
\p
\v 5 So now Father, may You take Me back into the glory which We’ve shared together since before this world was created.
\p
\v 6 “Father, I’ve introduced You\f + \fr 17:6 \fk introduced You \ft Literally, “I’ve revealed Your name.” Here again ‘name’ shows the whole identity of God. In this chapter, the way this was translated is the same as in verses 11-12 and 26.\f* to these people. They used to be on the side of worldly people too, but You gave them to Me. Of course they’re Your own possessions, but You, Father, have surrendered them to Me. And now they’ve obeyed Your teaching which I’ve given to them.
\v 7 So now they know that all that I’ve done and taught comes from You, Father.
\v 8 For I’ve shared the teachings that You’ve given to Me, and they’ve accepted all of them. Now they know that I really came from You, Father, and they believe that You’re the one who sent Me.
\v 9 So I’m praying now especially for them. My prayer isn’t for the people in this world who refuse to follow Your teachings. But I’m praying for those that You’ve given to Me, Father, because they are Your own.
\v 10 Everything that I possess is Yours, and everything that You possess, Father, is Mine too. So these followers of mine are Our joint possessions. Through them I’m being glorified.
\p
\v 11 But now I won’t live with them in this world any longer, because I’m going back to You soon. Holy Father, protect them with Your power, that is the power that You, Father, have given to Me. In that way, they’ll become one, just like You and I are one.
\v 12 As long as I’ve been with them, I’ve guarded and protected them with all the power that You’ve given to Me, Father, so that none of them was destroyed. Only one of them will be destroyed, that is the one who was already destined to be destroyed. In that way, what was written in Your Word is fulfilled.
\p
\v 13 “Now I'll soon return to You. For that reason I’m praying about all of these things while I’m still in this world, so that these followers of Mine can know my prayer, and be full of joy. May the joy of each of them be like My joy when they face difficulties.
\v 14 They have received Your teaching, which I gave them. The people of this world hate them, because, like Me, they aren’t on the side of worldly people.
\p
\v 15 I’m not asking You to take them from this world, but that You protect them from the attacks of the evil one, who is the devil.
\v 16 For they aren’t possessed by this world just like I’m not possessed by this world.
\v 17 Make them Your special possessions\f + \fr 17:17 \fk Your special possessions \ft Translates the words “make holy.” In this context, the meaning of “make holy” is that they’ll live as special possessions of God, prepared for and given power to serve Him. And their lives will certainly characterize holiness too.\f* through true teaching. All Your Word is true teaching.
\v 18 Just like You’ve sent Me to this world, Father, so I'll send them into the whole world too.
\v 19 Now as Your possession, I also surrender Myself to You, Father. And I do this for them, so that they may also become Your special possessions through Your true teachings.
\p
\v 20 “I’m praying not only for them, but also for the people who will later believe in Me because of their testimonies.
\v 21 And I’m asking that all of them become one just like You are one with Me, Father, and I’m one with You. I also pray that they’ll become one with Us, so that worldly people will believe that You, Father, are the One who sent Me to this world.
\v 22 I’ve given them the power and glory that You’ve given to Me. I’ve given that so that they’ll remain one, just like We are always one.
\v 23 That is, I’m one with them, and You’re one with Me, Father, until they really become one. In that way, the people of this world will know that You, Father, are the one who has sent Me, and that You always love My followers too, just like You always love Me.
\p
\v 24 Father, regarding those You’ve given to Me, I always want them to be with Me too, in the place where I'll be later on. I’m asking this, so that they may see the glory that You, Father, gave Me before this world was created. And of course, that glory was given to Me because You love Me so much.
\v 25 Yes Father, You always do what’s right. Even though the people of this world don’t know You, yet I know You. And these followers of Mine know that You, Father, are the one who has sent Me to this world.
\v 26 I’ve introduced You to them, Father, and I'll keep telling them about You. In that way, they’ll love Me from their hearts too, like you love Me. And I'll remain one with them.”
