\s Jesus and His brothers
\p
\v 1 After that, Jesus traveled around the region of Galilee. He didn’t want to go to the province of Judea because the Jewish leaders there wanted to kill Him.
\v 2 At that time it was close to the time when the Jewish people celebrated the Feast of Booths made of leafy branches, which lasted for seven days.\x + \xo 7:2 
\xtLev. 23:33-43; Num. 29:12-39; Deut. 16:13-15\x*
\v 3 Then Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Go to Judea so that the crowd which always follows you can see the miracles that you do.
\v 4 If a person wants to become famous, he can’t hide what he’s doing. So if you’re able to do miracles, show yourself to all the people.”
\v 5 Jesus’ brothers said that because they also didn’t believe that He was the Christ.
\p
\v 6 Jesus answered them, “It isn’t yet time for me to go to Jerusalem. But you can go anytime.
\v 7 For the people of this world can’t hate you. But they hate Me because I always tell them frankly that the deeds they do are evil.
\v 8 You can just go to the celebration. I’m not going now, because the time for Me to go there hasn’t come yet.”
\v 9 After saying that, Jesus stayed in Galilee.
\p
\v 10 But after His brothers went to the celebration, Jesus went secretly, so that the crowd didn’t know it.
\v 11 At the celebration, the Jewish leaders were searching for Him and kept asking, “Where is that man?”
\p
\v 12 A lot of whispering about Jesus was heard among the crowd that was at the feast. There were those who said, “He’s a good man.” But there were also those who said, “No, he’s a deceiver, who misleads many people.”
\v 13 But no one was brave enough to speak openly about Him because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders.
\s Jesus teaches in Jerusalem
\p
\v 14 On the fourth day of that seven day feast, Jesus entered one of the courtyards of God’s House and taught the crowd there.
\v 15 The Jewish leaders were surprised and said, “How can this man know so many things since he isn’t educated like us?”
\p
\v 16 Then Jesus answered them, “What I teach doesn’t come from Myself alone, but My teaching comes from the Father who sent Me to the people of this world.
\v 17 Everyone who wants to do the will of God will know if My teaching really comes from God, or if it just comes from My own thoughts.
\v 18 If a person’s teaching comes from his own thoughts, it means that he seeks honor for himself. But my teaching brings honor to the Father who sent Me. That’s a sign that I don’t lie, and that you can believe what I teach.
\v 19 It was pointless for Moses to give the Law to you, because none of you follows the Law! So why do you go against Moses’ teaching by trying to kill Me?”
\p
\v 20 The crowd answered, “You’re crazy, because you’re possessed by a demon! No one’s trying to kill you!”
\p
\v 21 Then Jesus answered them, “I did one miracle on the Sabbath Day and you’re amazed.
\v 22 In regard to working on the Sabbath Day, you have to remember that you also circumcise boys on the Sabbath Day if the child is born on the previous Sabbath Day. That agrees with the Law of Moses, even though the custom of circumcision actually didn’t come from Moses’ teaching, but from our forefathers.
\v 23 So, in order to obey the Law of Moses, you circumcise the male organ of a boy on the Sabbath Day. If so, don’t get mad if I heal the whole body of a sick person on the Sabbath Day!
\v 24 Don’t accuse Me or anyone else without thinking correctly, but weigh a person’s deeds with truth and justice.”
\s Questions of the Jews as to whether Jesus is the Christ
\p
\v 25 Then there were some people from Jerusalem who said, “Isn’t this the one they’re searching for in order to kill him?!
\v 26 Look! He’s teaching freely in public now, and they don’t do anything to him! Is it possible that our leaders have now changed their opinion and are aware that he’s the Christ?”
\v 27 But others were also saying, “It’s not likely that this man from Nazareth is the Christ, because when the Christ comes, no one will know where he came from. For when He’s sent from heaven, we wouldn't possibly call Him ‘a Nazarene.’ ”
\p
\v 28 For that reason, when Jesus was still teaching in one of the courtyards of God’s House, He said to the crowd with a loud voice, “Of course you know Me and you know the place I came from. But I didn’t come of My own will. I was sent by My Fathe, who can always be believed. You don’t know Him yet,
\v 29 but I know Him because I came from Him. He’s also the one who sent Me.”
\p
\v 30 When Jesus talked like that, the Jewish Leaders tried to arrest Him. But none of them managed to do anything to Him because the time to arrest Him hadn’t come yet.
\v 31 But many of the crowd believed in Him. They said, “When the Christ comes, He certainly won’t do more miracles than what Jesus is doing now!”
\s The Jewish leaders try to arrest Jesus
\p
\v 32 Then the Pharisees heard what the crowd said about Jesus. So they, along with the chief priests, ordered the soldiers who guarded God’s House to arrest Him.
\v 33 Then Jesus said to the crowd, “I'll only be with you a while longer. I'll return to the Father who has sent Me.
\v 34 You’ll search for Me, but you won’t be able to find Me, because you won’t be able to come to the place where I am.”
\p
\v 35 Then the Jewish leaders said to each other, “Where is he going that we won’t be able to find him? Does he want to go to the countries where the Jews are scattered? Is it possible that he wants to teach those who speak the Greek language there?
\v 36 What do these words of his mean, ‘You’ll search for me but you won’t be able to find me’? And why does he say, ‘You won’t be able to come to the place where I am’?”
\s The water that gives life
\p
\v 37 When the most important day of that Feast came, the seventh day, Jesus stood and spoke with a loud voice to the crowd that was in the courtyard of God’s House, “Whoever is thirsty, come to Me and drink!
\v 38 As it is written in God’s Word about the one who believes in Me, ‘from within his heart will flow streams of water that give life.’”\x + \xo 7:38 \xt Is. 58:11\x*
\v 39 Jesus meant the Holy Spirit, who would be received in the heart of everyone who believes in Him. But at the time He said that, the Holy Spirit hadn’t yet been given to believers, because Jesus still hadn’t experienced death, and hadn’t been raised to the place of His glory in heaven.
\s Many people argue about Jesus
\p
\v 40 Some of the crowd who heard these words of Jesus said, “He’s definitely the prophet whom we’re waiting for, who was promised to replace Moses.”\f + \fr 7:40 \fk promised to replace Moses \ft Moses had prophesied that God would appoint a prophet from among the Jews, just as God had appointed him, and everyone must listen to that prophet. See Deut. 18:15-19.\f*
\p
\v 41 And others said, “He’s the Christ.”
\p Others also said, “No way! The Christ won’t come from Galilee
\v 42 because in the Word of the Lord it's written that the Christ will come from the descendants of David, from the village of Bethlehem, where David used to live.”
\v 43 So that’s how the crowd argued with each other about Jesus.
\v 44 Some of the people in the crowd wanted to arrest Jesus, but no one dared to touch Him.
\s The Jewish leaders don’t want to believe
\p
\v 45 So the guard soldiers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees who had ordered them to arrest Jesus. Then they were asked, “Why didn’t you bring him in?”
\p
\v 46 Then they answered, “There has never been a man who taught like him!”
\p
\v 47 Then the Pharisees answered, “What! You’ve been led astray by him too!
\v 48 There still isn't even one of us leaders or Pharisees who believe in him, you know?!
\v 49 But the crowd that follows him doesn’t know anything about the Law. May God punish them!”
\p
\v 50 But Nicodemus was there too, who was one of their members who had previously come to meet with Jesus. Then he said to them,
\v 51 “Let’s not go against the Law! We must hear directly from that man, and check to see if he has actually done wrong before we say that he leads people astray.”
\v 52 Then they answered him, “Why do you defend him?! You aren’t a Galilean! Search the Holy Bible for yourself. You’ll see that it isn’t written that a prophet will come from Galilee.”

\v 53 After that, they all went to their own homes.]
