\s 144,000 of God’s people sing a new song
\p
\v 1 While I was still having the vision, the Lamb stood on Mount Zion with 144,000 people\f + \fr 14:1 \fk Mount Zion... \ft Mount Zion is the oldest part of Jerusalam, and the location of God’s House. In regard to the 144,000 people see Rev. 7:1-8.\f* who had the name of the Lamb and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
\v 2 Then I heard the sound of music from heaven, but its sound was like the sound of a huge waterfall, or like the sound of loud thunder. The sound was also like the sound of a very large group that played music on their harps together.
\v 3 Then the 144,000 people sang a new song, accompanied by that music, before the throne of God, before the four living creatures, and before the twenty-four leaders. That new song was a special song that was sung by the 144,000 people, who had been redeemed from the earth by the Lamb. Other people weren’t allowed to sing that song,
\v 4-5 because the 144,000 had guarded themselves so that they kept pure, and they didn’t defile themselves with immorality. They remained holy like a virgin. They lived without stain and never lied. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. He is the one who redeemed them from among the residents of earth. So those 144,000 people are the ones who became people especially reserved for God and for the Lamb.\f + \fr 14:4-5 \fk people especially reserved for God... \ft Literally, “first fruits for...” or “fruit (of the harvest) that is first for...” In the Old Testament, this term was used for the fruit of harvest like wheat and vegetables which were given as an expression of thanks to God. The first offspring of animals or the first-born male child were called by this same term. The first offspring of animals were sacrificed to God, whereas other animals were offered in place of each first-born male child of the Jews. (Lev. 23:9-14, Num. 26:1-11.)\f*
\s Three angels and the news they announce
\p
\v 6 Then I saw another angel flying high in the sky that come down bringing news of eternal salvation to be broadcast to everyone on earth, to every country, people group, tribe, and every group that uses a regional language.
\v 7 He cried out, “Praise God! Fear and honor Him! For the time has come for God to judge all people. Worship God, the Creator of the sky, earth, sea, and all springs of water.”
\p
\v 8 And there was a second angel who followed the first angel. The second angel also cried out, “The city of Babylon has been destroyed! The great capitol city of Babylon has been totally destroyed! That city has been punished by the wrath of God because its residents have, as it were, invited the residents of all other countries and people groups to get drunk on their wine. That wine illustrates the way they involved all people groups to live according to their immoral lustful desires, and that’s what has, as it were, poisoned all people groups.”
\p
\v 9 Then a third angel followed the second angel. That third angel also cried out, “Beware! Whoever worships the first beast and its idol, and receives the sign of worship on his forehead or on his hand,
\v 10 will also be punished by drinking the poisonous wine of the wrath of God, like the residents of Babylon!\x + \xo 14:10 \xt Rev. 15:7\x* That wine is pure, unmixed with anything else. Don’t be like them, because the wrath of God is poured out on them without mercy! And they’ll be tortured by fire mixed with sulfur before the Lamb and the angels in heaven.
\v 11 The smoke of the fire that tortures them will rise up forever. That’s the torture which will happen to those who worship the first beast and its idol, and receive the sign of its name. They are tortured day and night without stopping.”
\v 12 This means that God desires each of us, who have been made holy by Him, to keep enduring in obedience to all of His commands and to keep believing in Christ!
\p
\v 13 Then I heard a voice from heaven which said, “Write down this announcement: From now on, everyone who dies in oneness with the Lord Jesus is really happy!”
\p And that statement was affirmed with an amen by God’s Spirit Himself, who said, “Yes, it’s true! Their lives will be happy and they’ll rest calmly! They won’t ever experience any more trouble because of following the Lord, and they’ll be given a reward because of all their good deeds.”
\s Time to harvest wheat and grain on earth
\p
\v 14 I was still having that vision when I saw a white cloud. On top of the cloud sat someone who looked like the Son of Man, who was like Jesus Himself!\f + \fr 14:14 \fk Son of Man... \ft Literally, “like a son of man.” It isn’t clear here if this person is Jesus Himself, or an angel who illustrates Jesus. Almost all interpreters think that John doesn’t use the words “son of man” here with their root meaning, which is “normal human being.” See the note in Rev. 1:13.\f* He wore a gold crown and held a sharp sickle.
\v 15 Then another angel came out of God’s tent and cried to the one who sat on the cloud, “Swing Your sickle and harvest all of the wheat on earth! All of that wheat is already ripe, and the time to harvest has come!”
\v 16 Then the one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle and harvested all of the wheat on earth.\f + \fr 14:16 \fk harvested all of the wheat... \ft This illustrates when all of God’s people are gathered.\f*
\p
\v 17 Then another angel came from God’s tent in heaven. That angel also held a sharp sickle.
\v 18 And from the altar, which is in God’s tent, another angel came out, the one who has authority over the altar fire. He cried to the angel that just came out holding the sharp sickle, “Swing your sharp sickle! Cut and gather all the grapes on earth, because they are ripe.”
\v 19 Then that angel swung his sickle and cut all the grapes on earth, then he threw all of them into a very huge wine press. That wine press illustrates the place of carrying out punishment according to the wrath of God.
\v 20 Then the grapes were pressed outside of the city. And people’s blood flowed like a river from that wine press. Its depth was about two meters, and it flowed as far as three hundred kilometers.\f + \fr 14:20 \fk Verse 20 \ft Literally the measurement of depth is “as high as the head of a horse.” The length is literally, “1,600 stadia.” Grapes are usually pressed by people stepping on them to get the juice out. The ones who carry out the punishment on people in this vision are probably the angels.\f*
