\s The thousand year kingdom
\p
\v 1 Then I saw an angel come down from heaven with a huge chain in his hand, holding the key to the door of the pit of death.
\v 2-3 Then the angel captured and tied up the great dragon who is the snake that we know in the story of the garden of Eden, who is called the devil, and named Satan. Then the angel threw the dragon into the pit of death. After locking its door, he attached a seal to the door. And the devil will be tied up and imprisoned there for a thousand years so that he can’t deceive the people groups until the time of the thousand years is over. After that the snake will be released again, but only for a short time.
\p
\v 4 Then I saw many thrones, and the people sitting on those thrones were those who were considered worthy to receive authority to judge. I also saw the spirits of people who had been beheaded because they testified about Jesus and told the Word of God. They’re the ones who didn’t worship the beast or its idol and didn’t receive the sign of worshiping the beast on their foreheads or their hands. They lived again and ruled with Christ for one thousand years.
\v 5 That’s the time of the first stage when the dead are brought back to life again, whereas the other dead people won’t live again until the end of the thousand years.
\v 6 Everyone who takes part in the first stage of living again is truly blessed by God. They are truly holy, and they won’t experience the punishment of God that’s called “the second death.”\x + \xo 20:6 \xt Rev. 20:14\x* They’ll become priests who serve God and Christ, and they will rule with Christ for a thousand years.
\s The devil is defeated
\p
\v 7 When the time of a thousand years has ended, the devil will be released from prison, that is the pit of death.
\v 8 Then he’ll go and deceive all the people groups on earth. That's who was illustrated by the Prophet Ezekial as the king of Gog and the people group of Magog.\x + \xo 20:8 \xt Ezek. 38–39\x* Then he’ll gather them to fight against God, and the number of their soldiers is illustrated as the amount of sand on the ocean shore.
\v 9 All of the devil’s troops will come from all regions of earth to surround the camp of God’s people, that is the city loved by Him. But fire will come down from heaven and burn them.
\p
\v 10 Then the devil, who continually deceives, will also be thrown into the ocean of fire mixed with sulfur, the place where the first and second beasts were already thrown. They’ll be tortured there day and night forever.
\s The final judgment
\p
\v 11 Then I saw a glorious white thrown. And the One who sat on that throne was called the Most Glorious. He was so glorious that when His radiance shone, it made heaven and earth vanish like the radiance of the hot sun makes the clouds vanish.
\v 12 Then I saw that all of the other dead people\f + \fr 20:12 \fk other dead people \ft According to Rev. 20:5, this is what’s called the second stage of the dead coming alive again.\f* came back to life. They stood in front of the throne, both those who had a high status as well as the lowly. Then the books that recorded their deeds were opened, and one other book was also opened, the Book of Life. Then they were judged by their own deeds according to what was written in those books.
\v 13 Even the people who had died in the ocean came back to life and stood before the judgment throne. Everyone in the kingdom of death even came back to life and were judged according to their own deeds.
\v 14-15 Then everyone whose name was not written in the Book of Life was thrown into the ocean of fire. And finally the authority of death and the kingdom of the dead were also thrown into the ocean of fire. Thats called “the second stage of death.” There will be no more death! The authority of death is gone!
