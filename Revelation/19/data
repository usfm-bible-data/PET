\s Many people praise God in heaven
\p
\v 1 After that I heard the voices of a huge number of people who cried out in heaven.
\q1 “Hallelujah!\f + \fr 19:1 \fk Hallelujah \ft This word is from Hebrew and means “Praise Yahweh.”\f* May all glory and power be given to our God
\q2 who saved us!
\q1
\v 2 For He always judges right with justice.
\q1 So now God has judged the queen of prostitutes
\q2 who made the residents of earth stained by worshiping idols.
\q2 In God’s eyes it’s the same as the sin of immorality.
\q1 And God has repaid the murders of His servants on that prostitute
\q2 because she was the one who did it.”
\p
\v 3 Once more the crowd cried out,
\q1 “Hallelujah! The smoke from the fire that tortures the prostitute will rise up forever!”
\p
\v 4 So the twenty-four leaders and the four living creatures immediately fell headlong and worshiped God who sits on the throne. They cried out,
\q1 “Amen! Hallelujah!”
\p
\v 5 Then a voice was heard near the throne of God which cried out,
\q1 “Praise our God all you servants of God
\q2 who fear and honor Him, both those who have high and lowly status.”
\p
\v 6 Then I heard the voices of many people and the voices of angels. The sound was like a huge waterfall or like the sound of awesome thunder when they shouted,
\q1 “Hallelujah! For now our Lord God rules in reality!
\q2 Praise to the Almighty!
\q1
\v 7 Let’s rejoice and shout!
\q1 Let’s glorify God because the wedding day of Him who is called the Lamb has come!
\q2 And His bride has prepared herself.
\q1
\v 8 A robe of very clean and shining white linen cloth was given to His bride.”
\m His bride illustrates all the people of God who have been made holy through the work of Christ, whereas the white clean linen is the righteous deeds done by the people of God.
\p
\v 9 Then the angel who showed me all these things\x + \xo 19:9 \xt Rev. 17:1\x* told me, “Write this down: everyone who is invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb is truly blessed by God!” Then he said to me again, “Those are the true words from God!”
\p
\v 10 Then I immediately fell headlong to worship the angel. But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I’m also a servant of God just like you and your brothers and sisters in the faith, that is all the faithful who witness about Jesus. Worship God, because everyone who tells the news of salvation about Jesus carries out the work of the Holy Spirit just like prophesying.”
\s The vision about Jesus who is coming as the leader of war
\p
\v 11 Then I saw heaven open and a white horse appeared with a Man riding on it. The rider was Him who’s called ‘The Faithful One’ and ‘The True One’ because He’s always just when He judges people and when He fights against the people who oppose Him.
\v 12 His eyes were shining like flames of fire, and He wore many crowns. A name was written on His forehead which isn’t known by anyone other than He Himself.
\v 13 He wore a robe that had been dipped in blood. And He had another name which is “The Word of God.”
\v 14 And He was accompanied by the soldiers of heaven. Each of them also rode a white horse, and their robes were also made of clean white linen cloth.
\v 15 The One who led them was ready to make war with the power of His words which are illustrated by a sword with two sharp edges. With that power He’ll defeat the people groups who oppose Him. Then, when He rules as King He’ll “invoke harsh punishment on their wrongs and wickedness”. His authority to punish is illustrated by “an iron rod that easily destroys ceramic pots.”\x + \xo 19:15 \xt Ps. 2:7-9; Rev. 2:27, 12:5\x* He’s the one who’ll invoke punishment on every people group according to the wrath of Almighty God, and the destruction that falls on them is illustrated by pressing grapes to produce wine.
\v 16 There’s another name for Him written on the part of His robe which covers His thighs, which is
\q2 “King over all kings and Lord over all lords.”
\p
\v 17 Then in the sky I saw an angel stepping on the sun while crying out, “Come here all of you birds that fly in the sky! Come and eat at the feast of victory that has been prepared for you by God!
\v 18 Come and eat the flesh
\q1 of kings, generals
\q1 and brave soldiers
\q1 and the flesh of horses and all the riders of horses
\q1 and people from every people group,
\q1 including slaves and freemen,
\q1 both people who have high as well as lowly status.”
\p
\v 19 Then I saw that first beast\x + \xo 19:19 \xt Rev. 13:1-18\x* and all of the kings of the earth with their soldiers who had gathered to oppose the Rider of the white horse and His soldiers.
\v 20 Then the first beast was captured and also the second beast. He’s the one who worked as a prophet who made people go astray by doing various miracles which were done by the authority of the first beast. In that way he deceived everyone who had received the sign of worship which was a symbol of the name of the first beast. So the two beasts were thrown alive into the lake of fire mixed with sulfur.\x + \xo 19:20 \xt Rev. 14:10\x*
\v 21 And the Lord who rode that white horse killed all of their soldiers with just the power of His words. Then all the birds were very full because of eating their flesh.
