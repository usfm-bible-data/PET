\s Jesus’ letter to the church in Sardis
\pi
\v 1 “Write this to the Lord’s servant who represents the church in Sardis. This is the message from Me, who has all the power of God’s Spirit,\f + \fr 3:1 \fk all the power of God’s Spirit \ft Literally, ‘the seven Spirits of God’. In the Holy Bible, especially in the Revelation of John, the number seven has a symbolic meaning. John used the number seven to show things that are complete, perfect or godly. This is why God’s Spirit, which is one of course, can be illustrated as seven. (Compare Rev. 1:5, 3:1, 4:5 and 5:6.) There are also commentators who say that John thought about Is. 11:2-5, where Isaiah prophesied about the seven characteristics of the Holy Spirit, which are seen in Christ Himself.\f* and who holds the seven stars, which illustrate the seven churches:
\pi “I know how each of you lives. You are known as My faithful and zealous followers, but spiritually speaking you are actually almost dead.
\v 2 For that reason, wake up and rise up from death, and strengthen your spiritual lives which are almost dead, so they live again! For I know, before God, that none of your works have been totally completed.
\v 3 For that reason, remember the teaching which you’ve heard and believed from the beginning. Obey it and repent! If you resist guarding your spirits so that they live again, then I will come suddenly and punish you. And you won’t know ahead of time when I'll come, because I'll come like a thief.
\pi
\v 4 “But there are just a few people in the church in Sardis who haven’t stained yourselves by doing evil.\f + \fr 3:4 \fk haven’t stained yourselves... \ft Literally, “Haven’t stained your robes.” In the whole book of Revelation, clean or white robes illustrate holiness in one’s life style.\f* Each of you will walk with Me in white clothing, because you deserve to receive that honor.
\pi
\v 5 “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: white clothing will be given to you. And I won’t erase your names from the Book of Life. But before My Father, and before the angels, I'll state that you’ve proven faithful to Me.
\pi
\v 6 “What do you have ears for?! Listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!”
\s Jesus’ letter to the church in Philadelphia
\pi
\v 7 “Write this to the Lord’s servant who represents the church in Philadelphia. This is the message from Me, who is called “The Holy One,” and who is very worthy to be believed. I hold the “keys of David,”\x + \xo 3:7 \xt Is. 22:22\x* so I have the right to determine who will receive the right to become citizens of God’s kingdom. If I open the door for a person, no one can hinder him by closing that door. And if I close the door for a person, no one can open the door for him.
\pi
\v 8 “I know how each of you lives. I know that your strength to endure is very limited, yet you still follow My teachings and don’t deny that you are My followers. Because of that, look! I’ve opened the door of opportunity for you so that you’ll tell about Me, and no one can close that door of opportunity.
\v 9 Listen! I'll make the people, who are opposing you now, come and kneel before you and repent. They’re the ones who claim they are followers of the Jewish religion, but they’re actually the church of the devil. But I'll make them realize that I love you.
\v 10 You’ve obeyed My command to endure with patience as My followers. For that reason, I'll protect you from the time of trouble that will be poured out on the whole earth to test all the people who live on the earth.
\pi
\v 11 “I will come soon! Keep enduring in your faith in Me until I come, so that in this contest to defend your faith, no one will be able to steal your crown of victory when you’re so close to the finish line!
\pi
\v 12 “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: I'll make you like a large pillar in the House of My God. By that, I mean you'll have the right to live there forever. And on your body I'll write the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, which is the new Jerusalem that will come down from heaven. I'll also write My new name on you.\f + \fr 3:12 \fk verse 12 \ft The names written on the bodies of the victors show that they’ve become God’s and Christ’s possessions forever, and that they are citizens of the kingdom of heaven.\f*
\pi
\v 13 “What do you have ears for?! Listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!”
\s Jesus’ letter to the church in Laodicea
\pi
\v 14 “Write this to the Lord’s servant who represents the church in Laodicea. This is the message from Me, who is also called The Amen!\f + \fr 3:14 \fk Amen \ft Amen means “really agree” or ‘may it happen’. Here Jesus uses the word Amen as another name for Himself, and the meaning of that name is explained in the next sentence. Compare to 2 Cor. 1:20.\f* I mean that I am the Witness who is very worthy to be believed, who has taught what’s true about My Father. Through Me, My Father created everything.
\pi
\v 15 “I know how each of you lives, that spiritually you’re neither cold or hot. May you become hot or cold, and not just half-heartedly follow Me!
\v 16 So you can be illustrated by food that’s just lukewarm, neither cold or hot. I mean that you are like food which I spit out of My mouth as soon as I’ve tasted it!
\v 17 For each one of you thinks, ‘I’m already rich. The wealth that I’ve gathered is enough so that I won’t experience the lack of anything, anymore.’ But you don’t realize that spiritually you’re very poor, without hope, destitute, blind and naked.
\v 18 So I advise you to trade your riches for My gold, which has been purified in fire, so that you’ll truly be rich.\x + \xo 3:18 \xt Luke 16:9\x* And use your wealth to buy white clothing from Me, so that later on you won’t be naked and ashamed anymore. And buy oil to rub on your eyes, so that the eyes of your heart can see clearly.
\pi
\v 19 “My beloved children, I am the One who rebukes you and corrects you!\x + \xo 3:19 \xt Heb. 12:5-11\x* For that reason relight the fire of your enthusiasm again, and repent!
\v 20 Look! It’s as if I’m standing in front of the door of each of your homes, knocking and asking permission to enter. I will enter the heart of whoever hears My voice and opens the door of his heart for Me. Then we’ll often eat together as close friends.
\pi
\v 21 “This is the reward which will be given to each of you who wins in this spiritual battle: I'll give you authority to rule with Me. And you’ll sit on thrones to the right and left of My throne, \f + \fr 3:21 \fk thrones … \ft Literally, “sit together with Me on My throne, just as I wond and sit together with My Father on His throne.” According to the Greek language, Jesus sits together with His Father on His throne, however Jesus also has a throne and many who are victorious sit together with jesus on His throne. Obviously John used the words ‘sit together on the throne' as a metaphor to illustrate winning the right to rule together. In other verses in God's Word, (as in Matt. 19:28; 1 Cor. 6:2; Rev. 4:4) ruling together with God can also be referred to as thrones around His throne. The PET translates this using thrones according to the meaning of the metaphor mentioned.\f*just like I sat to the right of My Father’s throne, after I won the great spiritual battle.\x + \xo 3:21 \xt Matt. 19:28; 1 Cor. 6:2\x*
\pi
\v 22 “What do you have ears for?! Listen closely to this news that My Spirit gives to the seven churches!”
