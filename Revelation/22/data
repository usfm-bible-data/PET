\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then the angel showed me the river that flows with living water.\x + \xo 22:1 \xt Ezek. 47:1; Zech. 14:8; Rev. 21:6\x* The river flows from the throne of God and from the throne of the Lamb and it’s very clear, like crystal.
\v 2 The river flows in the middle of the main street which is in the center of the city. And the trees of life\x + \xo 22:2 \xt Gen. 2:9, 3:22; Rev. 2:7\x* are on the two sides of the river. Those trees bear fruit every month, twelve times a year. And people from every people group will use the leaves of those trees to heal their sicknesses.
\p
\v 3 In that city there will never be people or things that are cursed by God.\x + \xo 22:3 \xt Gen. 3:14-19; Zech. 14:11\x* The throne of God and the throne of the Lamb are there in that city, and the servants of God will serve and worship Him there.
\v 4 They’ll even see His face. And His name will be written on their foreheads.
\v 5 There’ll be no more night in that city, and they’ll no longer need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because God Himself will be the light for them. And they’ll rule as kings with Him forever.
\p
\v 6 Then the angel said to me, “All that you’ve heard and seen today is true and worthy to be believed. The Lord God alone gives the ability to His messengers to prophesy, and He’s the one who has sent me to show all of His servants what has to take place soon.”
\p
\v 7 Christ Jesus said to us, “Listen! I’m coming soon. Everyone who obeys all of the warnings that have been written in this book of prophecy is truly blessed by God.”
\p
\v 8 As I told you already, I (John), who wrote about all the vision in this book, fell down and worshiped the angel that told me and showed me all of these things.
\v 9 But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I’m also a servant of God like you and your brothers and sisters, God’s messengers, and like everyone who obeys all the warnings in this book. Worship God!”\f + \fr 22:8-9 \fk verse 8-9 \ft According to the note in Rev. 21:9, verses 8-9 can also be interpreted that this isn’t the angel mentioned in Rev. 17:1 and 19:10. If we make that interpretation, than this verse can also be translated that John once again fell down in front of a different angel. What is certain is that the Holy Spirit wants us to understand that we must not worship any angel at all. (See Col. 2:18-19 andHeb. 1:4-14)\f*
\p
\v 10 Then he said to me again, “Don’t keep the prophecies that have been written in this book secret, because the time for all of this to happen is near.
\v 11 So because the remainder of the time is short, whoever does what’s evil, keep doing what’s evil. And whoever allows himself to be stained, keep living according to your lustful desires. But whoever lives right, keep living right! And whoever has been made holy by Christ, keep living holy!”
\p
\v 12 And Christ Himself urges us, “Listen! I’m coming soon. I'll bring a reward which will be given to each person according to his deeds.
\v 13 I’m also called the ‘Alpha and the Omega’ Who is the one and only and Who always is, both before the beginning of creation and after all created things are gone.
\v 14 Everyone who washes their robes with the blood of the Lamb is truly blessed by God!\f + \fr 22:14 \fk with the blood... \ft So that it’s clear, the way their robes are washed is taken from Rev. 7:14.\f* In that way they receive the right to eat the fruit from the trees of life, and they’re permitted to enter the holy city through its gates.
\v 15 But people who are illustrated as dogs won’t be allowed to enter, that is those who stain themselves by their lustful desires. So those who aren’t allowed to enter that holy city are
\q1 sorcerers, people who do immoral things,
\q1 murderers, idol worshipers
\q1 and everyone who likes to deceive.
\p
\v 16 “I’m Jesus who sent My angel to testify about all of this to the churches. I’m the Descendant of David and the Leader of all of his descendants.\f + \fr 22:16 \fk Descendant of David \ft The prophets prophesied that the King of Salvation would come from the descendants of King David. Because of that, before Jesus came all the Jews called the King of Salvation the “Descendant of David.” (See Is. 29:18-19, 35:4-6, 42:6-7; Mark 10:47)\f* I’m the one illustrated by the morning star which shines brightly in the east.”
\b
\q1
\v 17 And the Holy Spirit and the Bride of the Lamb, that is all the unified churches of Christ say, “Oh, Christ, come quickly!”
\q1 And may everyone who hears this also cry out, “Oh, Lord, please come!”
\q2 But before Christ comes, whoever is thirsty let him come to Christ!
\q2 Whoever wants to drink the water of life receive it from Jesus
\q2 because He gives that water as a gift!
\p
\v 18 I (John) give this warning to everyone who hears the prophecies that I’m writing in this book.
\pi Whoever adds something to this book, God will add a very harsh punishment to him, that is he’ll experience the disasters which are written in this book.
\v 19 And whoever takes something away from the prophecies that are in this book, God will remove his right to enjoy the various blessings that are written in this book. So he won’t be allowed to enter His Holy City or eat fruit from the trees of Life.
\p
\v 20 Remember! Jesus, who is always worthy to be believed, says, “I’m coming soon.”
\p Amen! Come Lord Jesus!
\p
\v 21 May our Lord Christ Jesus always be kind hearted to each of us. AMEN!
