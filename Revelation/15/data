\s The seven angels who bring about the last punishment of disasters
\p
\v 1 Then I saw another miracle in heaven which was very terrible and shocking. I saw seven angels who were given the task to cause the seven final disasters. Then all of the punishment because of the wrath of God will be finished.
\p
\v 2 I first saw a sea of glass before the throne of God,\x + \xo 15:2 \xt Rev. 4:6\x* but this time it was like it was mixed with fire. And on the edge of the sea of glass stood everyone who had defeated the first beast with its idol and the number which illustrated its name. They stood holding the harps that God had given them.
\v 3 And they were singing a song of victory which was first created by Moses, the servant of God. With that song they praised God for the victory which they received from the Lamb,
\q1 “Great and awesome are all of Your deeds, Oh Lord God Almighty!
\q2 King of all people groups, everything that You’ve done is just and right!
\q1
\v 4 Everyone will honor and fear You, Oh Lord.
\q1 And everyone will praise and glorify Your name.
\q2 Because it’s really obvious that You alone are Holy.
\q1 So all people groups will come and fall headlong worshiping You
\q2 because it’s clear that Your judgment is just and right.”
\p
\v 5 Then I saw God’s tent in heaven and the Most Holy Room whose door had previously been closed by a cloth curtain. I saw that the curtain was now open!
\v 6 Then the seven angels who had the task to bring about the seven final disasters came out from there. They each wore linen robes which were very white and shining and golden belts which were so wide that they came up to their chests.
\v 7 Then one of the four living creatures gave a golden bowl to each of the angels. The bowls were full of poisonous wine which illustrates the punishment because of the wrath of God, He who lives forever.
\v 8 And God’s tent was suddenly filled with smoke, illustrating the glory and authority of God.\x + \xo 15:8 \xt Ex. 40:34; 1 Kings 8:10; Is. 6:4\x* Because of that no servant could enter God’s tent until the seven disasters brought about by the seven angels were ended.
